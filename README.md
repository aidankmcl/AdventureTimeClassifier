# Adventure Time Classifier
a classifier that tells you which Adventure Time character you're most like

We all love AT, maybe so much that sometimes we talk like the characters do...

If you've ever been curious about which character you're most like, this model is trained on the transcripts of every episode and can classify phrases by character.

# Current Status
Just finished MVP of scraper that automates the grabbing of transcript text, am now working on organizing data collection/labelling and have yet to start playing with [Indico](www.indico.io)'s model creation tool called Passage*

[Passage](https://github.com/IndicoDataSolutions/Passage) is a library made by Alec Radford for creating predictive models that deal with text. It uses machine learning (Recurrent Neural Networks specifically) to analyze text and determine similarity between what our homies in the show say and what we do.

Interested in getting involved in this or future projects? Suggestions? Daps and pounds? hmu at aidankmcl@gmail.com
