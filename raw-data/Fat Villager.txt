Please, please help me. A monster is terrorizing our village and has eaten up all the crops.
I thought I saw some food, and I was hiding from the monster.  You must help.
Umm, I don't remember.
Howard remembers. Hey! It's Howard! Howard! You remember where the village is?
Monster! Monster! Monster! Monster!
Did she just call us fat?
Look, the monster eats while it apologizes! Let's kill it!
We have to!
If we let her go, she'll keep eating our crops, and we'll starve!
We are parents! Those crops were for our children!
