What? You kept calling and call...
I didn't say anything.
Oh? Uhh. Yeah! I suppose I could!  Shirmo lock kanta Floriana
I don't know, it's dumb! I'm still working on it! It's-It's nothing!
Ohh! You're the greatest wizard ever!
There you are, sir. There you are.  Right this way.
Caw! Tada!
I've always been into interpretive dance. But I've never been able to find a musician who could match my energy until now!
No!
No!
Ow! Why are you doing this?!
Yeah? You guys liked it?
Uh... oh, Glob.
I just remember that I'm, uh, a-allergic, uh, to, to the night sky.
Yes, if I ever had to walk, uh, outside at night, I might die of-of...
Of fright!
All right!
Maybe.
Whoa!
Ha! Totally!
Wow! Cool!
Ohh!
Yeah!
What?!
No way! That sounds awesome! Too bad neither of us can read Demon Runes.
Wow! It looks so real!
Nobody can defeat us if we work together! Super Wizard Team Up!
Uh, hey, so, uh, I should be getting home.
I thought your house broke.I don't know. We just picked him up. That's the kind of trip this is gonna be. It's a destiny will guide us kind of thing.
Okay, Ron James, it's time.
Just got one more stop.
Hey, water nymphs! Uh...hi. Uh...do you girls feel like, uh...going on a road trip?
Okay, but what if I...
Here we go!
I think we ran out of gas.
Let's all write down arcane, cryptic words in unexpected new combinations and patterns. Maybe the nymphs can dance on top of the bus to be, like, our muses.
Is there a problem?
Can I take over?
What?
Thanks. Hey, I don't think we're moving.
Ice King! I see the Butt Rock!
Smells so good down here! What's cooking?
Maybe this is a test from destiny, guys! If we all just surrender to these events, the answer will reveal itself.  Whoa.
What was he?The opposites.
The wizards with opposite powers will take each other on first.
Yes. My name is Abracadaniel.
Who's that?
Well, he's right.  I only entered this contest 'cause I thought the prize would be money. But it's just a kiss!
Blegh, no way. If I was the winner, I would turn my face so our lips  wouldn't touch and I would push Princess away. Turn and push, turn and push, turn and push...
...turn and push, turn and push. Well, I'm going back to my cave to wait for someone to kill me. Goodbye.
You will?
Oh, okay.
Rock Wizard!
Cantrip!
My body is squishy. That's how I survived.
Yes!  I did it! I really did it. I'm a true wizard.
Abracadaniel!
I do. I feel real good.
Oh, w-w-well thank you, Grand Master Wizard. I guess through this trial I have become a great wizard. I, I came here with no self-esteem and no chances, a will-o-wisp of a boy, but I walk out this arena a man. A confident man! Who deserves a kiss from a princess!Huh? Do I know you?
Oh, guys, I don't know, that's not my place. I just work here and I-
Hey, guys, wait for me!
Wha-? Really?
Nooooooo!
This isn't happening!
Ouch!
Bubblegum, I hereby challenge you to an honorable prison stabbing to the death!
Strike me down and restore my honor.
Oooooo!
