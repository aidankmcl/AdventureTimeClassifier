Fighters! Fighters!  Seek you glory from the Fight King?
Then step forth beyond the Moonlight seal to bathe in blood and glory forever.
Fools! All exits are sealed!  Now you must fight my Gladiator Ghosts!
Good... Take these branches of palm.
Where do you think you're going?  You must earn thy freedom by defeating each of my ghosts! When you are ready, speak the Fight King's name, and I shall raise you for... battle.
Gladitoria continues for you, human, and, er... dog?
Arise, Priscus, Verus!
Pity. The dog falls.
The combat endeth. Now come closer, champion.
Come closer, my champion. You have proven worthy of my favor.
Accept your prize.
Ah... The dog lives.
Fighters, rest now.
No, for there is one more opponent.
Your dear companion!
Why do you stop?
Then this is round two, my vassal! Take his head for me!
Yes...
Yes...
Yes... FINISH HIM!!!
Aaarghh...
