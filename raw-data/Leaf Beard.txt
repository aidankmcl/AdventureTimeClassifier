Oh, good, you're awake. I am Leaf Beard. I found you blonked out and bruised in the tunnels. But if you drink of our dewdrops, it will fix up all your ouchies.
The rat king has made his way to our end of the roots. You should be more careful.
Oh. You're not from the roots.
The rat king's been destroying our home, chewing up the roots of this tree. This tree that gives us life!
So sick, nasty bad.
Your sword was shattered to butts when I found you.
Yes. Bums.
Um...I don't know. But the blacksmith could make you a new one, probably.
