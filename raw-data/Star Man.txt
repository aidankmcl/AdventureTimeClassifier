Missiles away!  Impact with catalyst comet in five, four, three, two, one!
Uh, yeah, probably, right?  Shoot! No affect! It's still coming right at us!
Uh, yeah, I'm surprised we even had those ones. Like who would we shoot a missile at? Who'd we shoot at?!
Rooot!
Whoa! What are you doing?!  .
Yes! Grob, Gob, Glob, and Grod diverted the comet, it's back on its normal path to Earth.
No sign of Glob.
