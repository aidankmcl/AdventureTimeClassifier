Hi, Finn. Hi, Jake.
Hi, Finn.
Yeah, thanks Finn. I'm excited to learn.
Yes, Jake.
Jake, these kids seem pretty scary.
Yeah, I think so Finn. I've learned a real lot already so far. Sooo much... from Jake.
Ready!
Alright, listen up! You kids better stop dunking around and get on that ramp!
You're gonna mess up Goliad! I'm Don Juan Cherry Temp  Cherry Tempo! It's my way or the highway, Glob-globbit!
My brain? Are you sure?
Okay, Finn.  Okay.
No, Finn. This way is good. Everyone did what I wanted. Really fast, no mistakes, calm like you said. This is definitely is the way to lead. Definitely.
Hello, Princess.
Yes, I led the children.
Yes, it was good.
No, Princess. Bee cares not for flower. If getting pollen hurts or kills flower, bee would not care.  Bee is stronger than flower.
Goliad is stronger than bee.  Goliad is stronger than all.
No, Princess.   This is my castle now.
Wait, brother, why must we fight? Rule with me!
No, brother! Don't you see? They're turning us against--
So be it.
