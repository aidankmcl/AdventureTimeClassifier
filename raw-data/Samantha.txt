Hi. I'm Samantha.
But I haven't seen a man-dog in years! And now the universe has dropped one into my arms!
But fate has brought us together! The stars have paired you with a goddess.
Yes, if I'm so crazy, then let's fight!
I don't wait for rescue. I conquer till I am conquered. By love... or by the hand of an adversary.
Coward!
Very well.
You've returned me to my world, so I recant my oath to destroy you.
Let's fight again some time.
Hmm. Took you long enough to stretch outta that pit.
