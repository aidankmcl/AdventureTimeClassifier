Uh, hello?
Huh?
This must be it, man.  I've crossed into some super-insane zone where I feel like I'm just normal again.  Or maybe I'm just normal again.
Sorry, man. No time! Go, carpet!  Whoa!  It's got to be here. Even in my prolonged state of insanity, my immutable essence must have known tooh, yes.  Hello.  Ah, my research. My jackiejacket!  Mutation, mutation, mind expaaha!  Mystic Rituals And Their Space Time Applications by Simon Petrikov and Betty Grof.  Betty.  Whoops. Marceline?
Marcy, it's me, Simon. I'm back, but my body might donk out soon, so get to the Ice Kingdom fast and help me with this time portal so I can find Betty and say I'm sorry before I croakboat! I know that's a lot to process, but hurry, and bring Hambo. Hambo is the key.
Marceline!
I can hardly believe it myself. You're all grown up.
One million years? How could it be?!
Nothing specificjust dreamlike impressions.
I have... bruises.  Excuse me. I
I'm fine.
Well, yes, but only in increments. I've still got work to do. Finn and Jake, will you run my generator?
That's great! Keep pedaling! All we need now is the catalystan object from the past that has been lovingly tended to through the ages.
Because of you, I can say goodbye to Betty and tell her I'm sorry for driving her away. Thank you, Marceline.
Betty? Betty. Betty!
I'm a thousand years in the future, love. I opened this portal so we could say goodbye.
No! It's just that everything changed after I put on that crown. II went crazy. You ran away. II never saw you again.
I'll never know.
The portal is closing. There's no time to explain. Just know that I love you, and I forgive you for leaving me.
Who?
No, I'm old. The crown was keeping me alive, but its magic was negated by the creature Bella Noche.
Oh, I'm sorry, Betty.
What? No. Guys, stop her.
No!
I am getting on... the death bus.
It's my time, Betty! I don't want to be the Ice King again. It's like living with eternal diaper butt. I can't do it!
I...
If I don't let her try, then what am I? What am us?
Just hold my hand to your face. This will be my... last sensation.Little help?
The crown. Go get it.
Get the crown! Go get it!
Get the crown, Marceline! Go get it!
Oh, that's really disappointing I must say. I'm justuh, whatever, you're really letting me down right now.Hello. My name is Simon Petrikov. I am recording this tape so that people will know my story.
I was studying to be an antiquarian of ancient artifacts. Now, I never believed in the supernatural stuff myselfjust had a fascination with superstitions... but everything changed when I came into contact with this item....
After purchasing this crown from an old dock worker in northern Scandinavia, I brought it home and excitedly showed my fiancee Betty,  and jokingly put it on my head just for a laugh or something... and that's when it started... The visions...  I fought with them...  Shouted at them until I realized it wasn't realit was the crown!!  I quickly took it off... and saw my fiancee in front of me...  looking at me with such contempt. What had I said? What had I done when I wore this crown? All I know is I never saw Betty again.
Since then, I see the visions always whether or not I wear the crown. They tell me the secrets... the secrets of the ice and snow... that the power of the crown will save me with its frost. I don't yet know what this means. As you can see, my skin is beginning to turn blue. My body temperature has been lowering at a supernatural rate, to what is now about 30C. I don't know when it will end... I'm really scared...
I know my mind is changing... but I'm already too far gone to know what to do. I want people to know that... if I do things... if I do things that hurt anyone, please... please forgive me.
Just watch over me until I can find a way out of this labyrinth in my brain and regain my sanity!! And then maybe Betty, my princess... maybe you will love me again.  Please love me again, Betty!!All finished.Huh.
Ha-ha! Might be something in here, Marceline!
Hey! Yeah, so it is, looks like we've got a cute new traveling buddy.
It's kinda cute...
Hey, check it out, it's a VHS tape. You wanna watch a movie?
...Man, this is a boring movie.
I like the book much better!
He-he-he, yeah, I suppose so... Huh?
I'm not sure, but it's coming our way. Come on.  Marcy, you stay in the car. I'll be right back.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
I have to. To protect us.
Don't worry, I can control it better now.
It's okay! B.R.B.  Oh, boy. Here it comes. Oh, bread balls. Oh, bread balls! OH, BREAD BALLS!  I call upon the power of ice and snow!! Ice winds, blow!!!  Rragh! YOU WILL NO LONGER TERRIFY A 47-YEAR-OLD MAN AND A 7-YEAR-OLD GIRL!
Not now, Gunther, I'm doing big people things. Come play in the snow, build me a snowman.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-- Huh?
Uh...uh...yeah.
Oh, yeah. Did I look pretty...FLY?!
I'm sorry. Did I say something?
OK. I promise.
It's a deer.

Making your way in the world today, takes everything you got.
Taking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot. Sometimes you want to go, where everybody knows your name!
Filmed before a live studio audience.  Norm!
Marcy...?  Oh, no... Uh, you're fine. Just a bit warm, but you should get some sleep.
Oh, you're even worse.  I mean, don't freak out or anything, but we need to get you some... chicken soup!  There you go.  There must've been a soupery in that town, but I don't want you walking all...  ...that way.  Okay. You ready for a motorbike ride?
Okay, now we're talking.  Just needs a little love--
WOWZERS!
Okay, let's try something else.
Hey, Marcy, I wrote a song for you.
Here we go!  Aw, it's locked.  Vandalism is wrong, Marcy.
Oh, everything's gone... except for these greeting cards.  Aw...
What is that thing? This-This is bad.
I have to protect us.
I have to.
Marcy, stay back!
Aah!
We're getting out of here!
Hey, little lady, what about a ride on an old man's back?
Look, sweetie, someday you'll be too big to hold. I'm as old as garlic balls, and if someone offered to pick me up and carry me, I'd do it in a heartbeat. Take it when you can get it.
Gross.  You're gross.
We're both gross, darling.  A food truck! Might be chicken soup inside there.  Alright, now to get some chicken soup inside you-- Clams?  The Clambulance?! No, I need chicken! Marceline, cover your ears! MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER!
Mother, Mother!   Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother...!
We're gonna run!
Come on, come on, come on!!
Mama, mama, mama, mama, mama mia!
Not yet.
I'm sorry Marcy.
You have to keep it together Simon... for her.
Marcy! Look I-I found chicken soup! Your gonna feel awesome in a moment.
Do you feel awesome?
I love you... Gunther.
