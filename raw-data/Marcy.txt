Hmmmmmm...
E-e-ewww! It's a dead rat!
Ewww, noooooooo!!
Yeah!
You're so silly, Simon!
What is that?
Simon!
You're not going to put it on, are you?
But you're gonna act weird again!
Mmm...
Simon, stop! It's frozen!
Bleh!
Simon! Simon, are you okay?!
You're getting worse, Simon. Your hair and your nose are longer, and you started to hover in the air!
What are you talking about? You're scaring me.
Simon, promise me you won't put it on again.
What is that thing?
If there are deers in the forest, do you think there are other things?
What is this?
Mute.
Hey! Good morning! I made you breakfast! It's mostly pine needles and deer guts.
Mmm-hmm.
AAH!
Your songs are sooo good.
Okay.
Simon, look!
No.
No!
No, don't put it on!
Oops.
I can walk. I'm not a child, Simon.
You're gross, Simon.
What are we gonna do, Simon?
Whoa!
Our butts are grass, right?
Don't leave me here Simon! I can fight!
Simon!
Simon you promised.
I'm just glad  you're ok.
I love you, Simon.
