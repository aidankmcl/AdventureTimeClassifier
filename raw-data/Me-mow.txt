Treachery! Hiya!Quiet! Or you die! .
Me-mow, assassin second class, ...but once I take out a princess, I g'aduate to full membership.
Yes, I know, but since you've blown my cover, you will slay Wildberry Princess.
Oh. Uh... okay.
Good. Oh, and if you try to trick me, I'll poison you.
Blagh! It's like worn garbage up in here!
What's going on out there?
You did it! Well done! I guess I'll be on my way.
Grraa!! You liar!
Okay, Jake. I've injected you with half the poison, you'll be dead in thirty minutes, unless you kill the princess, which is when I'll give you the antidote
If you say anything, I'll stab you in the brain!
Gonna double cross Jake... and leave him to die...
Puppy... hoodies...
Time's running out, Jake! Do you want the antidote, or not?
Don't make me give you the rest.
Do it, Jake, do it!
The name's Me-mow.
Try it, oaf!
You're at my mercy!
We'll see who's laughing when you're blind!
What, this antidote?
Forget it, kid. I gave Jake enough poison to kill a dog fifty times his size.
A magic dog? Nooo!
You've ruined me! I have to wait a whole year to retake the assassins test!
