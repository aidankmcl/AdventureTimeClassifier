'Cause I can hear a bunch of apples in this room.
No.

I'm just telling you the facts, ma'am. What I hear is a whole pigload of apples inside that closet.  They sound scared.Psst, Sweetie, you look so nice.
Psst... sweetie, what are ya doing?

Wait, Tree Trunks. Look around: everyone we care about is all here together. Finn, Uncle Donald, Banana Guard Number 1, Jake, Jake Junior, everybody. We can have the ceremony right here.
Oh, my gosh. Tree Trunks, did you hear?
The King said you can perform your own dang ceremony!

You're crazy.
I think I am in love with her! But I don't know how to go about it...
Phew...
Uh-huh, alright okay...  Ms. Tree Trunks... Ma'am, today, I wish to speak my feelings.
Mmmm, that's good.
We should hug.

You can't do this! Wait
Stop!
Little dove!
I'm homeless.
I guess I'll just go back to eating criminals.  I miss her...
Dream of love... Are we truly parted? Must this Pig forever walk alone? In my dreams, our love is just a dream to me... but in my heart, it lives and breaths and grows.
