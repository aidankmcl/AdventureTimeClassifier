Hello, every
Oh my! Looks like you almost skronked up my dome piece!  Boy, have I got a treat for you two! The fluffy people and I baked these in appreciation for the mission you completed. They're cream puffs... try one.
Aww...
It is wet...
Oh... it's just him.
Ahem!
Fionna, take me back inside.
Oh, honestly! I'm going in. Come and join me when you want more polite company.
Whoa!What? No! They can't even talk.
Kick it! Thanks for helping me out guys.
Oh, they're decorations for my Biennial Gumball Ball. Tonight!
Yes! So very large. I'd like you to be there as my special guest.
Heck yes. As my pal!
It starts at seven, so don't be late!
Gah! Slush Beast!
You saved me from the Ice Queen!
She must have fled. Fionna, you're so strong. And you look so beautiful in the snow. What are you doing later?
Come with me. Let's go out.
Yeah. Let's go somewhere.
Great! Meet me in the castle gardens in an hour!
Hello, Fionna. And I see you brought Cake.
Only if it's cool that I brought... Lord Monochromicorn!
Accept these tokens of our esteem.
Nonsense. For you, Cake, a satchel of nepetalactone. Mo-Chro picked it himself.
And for you m'lady, a bouquet of posies.
There's a surprise at the center.
I pay attention to things I see you being all about.
Come, for the wowiness has only just begun!
Oh, Fionna!
I thought we might have a little race. A playful race to Marshmallowy Mweadows.
Excellent.
Good race, Fionna.
Sorry, I saw a pearl pygmy skull in there. It reminded me of you. The way your eyes sparkle.
Fionna, there's something I want to tell you.
Okay, okay, now you ask me something.
Fionna, come to the ball with me.
No, as my girlfriend.
I've been looking for you.
Ha ha! Hey, I wanna show you something.
Fionna.
Oh, my goodness.
Wow, Fionna. You're, you're just really incredible. Maybe we should meet up, for a date.
What?!
