I make no such promise. Darren must feed.
I had a dream I was fighting an army that could birth new soldiers from their own blood. I was endless. Does that make sense?
What's that?
What is caring? What kind of world is this?
I don'twalk me through this.
This kingdom of candy...
I will lay it to waste, turn their people to salt.
And garnish a million meals with the salt, which we will eat for eternity.
I promise, as well, to deliver destruction so thorough that all realities are affected.
All realities.
This is taking too long.
I call forth the Legion of Cadmus, the Dragon's Teeth!
It's over, Princess. Prepare to be annihilated across all dimensions.
What the flip is feelings? Darren only understands life and death!
Wah!
Eli, were you asleep forever too? All this stuff is different now. What are we even doing here?
Yeah, right.
Thank you.
