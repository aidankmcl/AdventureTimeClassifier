Mom? Mom, what's wrong?
What! Sell Bartram?  But, I love Bartram. What the heck, Mom!
Dad?
The Destiny Gang?
I'm sorry, Bartram. I guess Dad must be in real trouble to be doin' this. But, I bet there's a lot o' fine folk lookin' to buy a good mule. Why, I bet I could even come visit sometimes. Won't that be swell, Bartram?  Bartram? Dang it Bartram! Bar Bar!  What the- Bar Bar, how'd ya get up there?  Whoa!  Jake, look! Golden crown! Unbelievable! We can sell it and keep Bartram! Bong, bong.
Who are you?!
Okay, okay! But, um, maybe I could just borrow it for a little while.
Uhh, none o' that is true, 'cause magic is fake. Daddy says the false prophets of old used cheap parlor tricks to control the people.  And to get babes. Like 10 or 12 hot babes each.
Lady! You been down here too long! Why don't you, just let me-
Lady! Quit it with that thing!
WAAAAAAAAAAaaaaah... ooo... uuum...
Go, Jake!
Sorry, gotta save my dad!
Cool crown! Who wants a cool crown? I found it on a dead magician dude!
Awesome! How much cash ya got?
No.
Hey!
Wait, Destiny Gang. I gotta sell that to pay you guys!
Okay, you guys. Gimme my money and leave my parents alone.
I guess it wasn't really mine.
Whaat!  Bar Bar!
Bar Bar.
My name is Finn Mertens! And tell big D I'm comin' for my stuff!
Are you okay, lady?
I promise.
Choose Bruce, what is it?
Feels natural. Like peeing outside. Sort of.
No. I want them to see me. I'm-a go up there AND SHOW THEM MY FACE!  Yaaaaaaaaaa-huh? Hello?  Bar Bar? I'm comin'! Bar bar!  I want my stuff, ya big dump!
Yeah, and Bar Bar.
Wha?
What do you...mean?
Suck my shirt!  Choose Bruce!
Bar Bar, come on!
I will, but we gotta stop the Destiny gang first. Come on Jake! Good boy!
Noooo!
Mom! Dad!  You said this thing is magic?
But you lost your mind in a cave.
I believe you.
Aaaaaah!!
