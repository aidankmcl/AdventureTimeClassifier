Magic Man, it bums me out to see this. I remember when you were really cool, before that night you spent on Olympus Mons with Margles.
What happened, Magic? Why did you go crazy? If you had just learned to care about living things again, you could have come back whenever you wanted!
You sad Magic Man. Instead, you bummed around Ooo, acting like a jerk for 200 years.
Now! Ready the Wand of Disbursement!
Space Dome, open!
Magic Man, I give you two choices. One is total annihilation. The wand will touch you, and your soul will meet with Death. The second is to use the power of the wand to convert your body to living stardust, where your consciousness will be jettisoned into the infinite cosmos, on an endless journey of wonder and DISCOVERYYYYYY!!!!!
Wait. Did you say you would miss someone?
And that someone would miss you?
You're right, Finn the Human. My judgement was less than the standard by which I judge my peers. Of which I have none. I will retrieve your friend from the 37th Dead World.  Death.
I need this one back.
In that case, I offer my immortality.
