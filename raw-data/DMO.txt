Greetings, and welcome to MO Co. I'm DMO. Please state your business.
Greetings, JMO. FMO, you look ridiculous. Are you damaged? Are you in need of repair?
Fantastic. Okay. Please get ready for your total personality wipe.
Ah, yes. 47.3% of MOs eventually return to the factory for assorted sentimental biz. Please step 100% on the ultra-tram for your complimentary tour.
Greetings.
We are now passing over the famous factory floor. Birthplace of each and every MO. Behold the gleaming machinery! Teeming and wild with the throes of real creation. From this unlikely chaos emerges every shiny new MO.
I'm sorry. I'm just a tram MO. I'm not programmed to understand that question. Also, you're just a JMO. You're not programmed to ask that question.
That question-
Anyway, MO Co. was founded over 1,000 years ago. By Moseph Mastro Giovanni. A sad and gentle man. Beloved by only those he built to belove him. On your left, you'll see the core system driver installation port bay.
What?! Are you crazy?! Get back here!
Hey! Only MOs are allowed in the facility 1,000%!  Get off of my tram!
Hit 'em again!
