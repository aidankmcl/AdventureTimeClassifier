Hey, uh, barkeep, can I have another one of these ciders?
Hey, little robot. How ya doing?
Hey, did you know I used to be married to Tree Trunks?
Heh, yeah... it's just me and TT. We had some wild times back in the day. Did you know I once taught her to play tennis?
Yep, tennis! I took her to one of those... uh... paddles... or whatever, you know!
Yeah, she left me. She said I was stifling her spirit... I mean hehe... You know, what? Not enough tennis for ya?
No! Uh, please stay here! This is cathartic. You're a good listener.
BMO, you're so nice.
I've had a hard life. People seem cute. They seem nice. And then when you can't stop crying because they beat you in tennis that one time, they call you a baby.
BMO?
BMO, would you move in with me?Aw, aw geez. You got me.
Because it's amazing! Oh, I can't get enough of it.
But I want thirds and fourths! I want to stop when I want to stop!
Oh, it's the only good part of my day.
