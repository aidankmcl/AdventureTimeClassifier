Tiffany! Finn, I'm gonna kill you!
Yo, Finn! I'm gonna kill you!
Ruff! Thought so.
Yeah, I lost my teeth eating the Baker's Shard. It's a lot of sugar, right?
See, this is a good example of why I want to kill you. You're ignorant.  Heed my words, Finn. As the miller's wheel forever outrages the seed, so the good apple boringly receives his neighbor's worm.
And all the corn gets smushed to greaseto grease under the miller's fleaping wheel.
You're getting greased!
Bygones? Ha!  That's you. Bye!  Gone!
Bye-gone!
Tonight, light's out. Tomorrow, your eyes out!
I don't need some fancy thinger to kick butt when I've got these!  You know about these?
You will. Anyway, I just kinda wanted your sword 'cause it's pretty cool, I guess. Whatever. I'll get it soon enough... from off your dead corpse, you chump!
Bullstuff.
I was friends with Jake. Then some baritone herb stole him away from me.
And when that snow-white wiener dog is finally dead, Jake will be devastated.
He'll need a shoulder to cry whiny, Finn-style tears on, and that shoulder will be mineTiffany's! Then I can get busy with undoing your cheesy influence, plus more! With my help, Jake will become the criminal juggernaut he was always meant to be.
We won't just be robbing banks anymore.
We'll be robbing the actual banks. The whole banks!
You get it? We're gonna steal actual whole buildings.
So don't tell me we're not so different, okay?! We're opposites, you and me. Oil and goody-goody snow-white baby-vanilla bean mitten water! Go, Tiffany!
Finn! Get in here, quick!
There's something moving in the walls. It was like .
You good?
Finn!
Mm...
You're right, Finn. I can't bring myself to do it...
...but I can't bring myself to save you, either.
Why are you still smiling?
Look, you'reyou're on your own. I'm sorry.
Catch you on the flip, I guess.Jake's MY best friend now! FOREVER!
No! Jake will be mine!
You'll never defeat me! I will! Be Jake's best friend! Because I'm! Tiffanyyyy  Ahhhhhh!Well, well. From the shadows of dream, the dog wakes to find itsughthe dog wakes to find its mangy tail flopping in the dust like a fish in a tree. That fish is me! Tiffany!  I'm coming Jake, I'm coming!]
Never mind that, the real question is what's that slo-mo Finn know about this?
Can't ya see guys, he's desperate! Somebody got to him 'cause he's soft now.
Glom you, Jake.
What the?!
I know that vault inside and out! Every guard rotation, every camera, every deadly trap. And that safe is locked up so tight it makes me wanna spit out my guts and cry about it. Do you even have a plan, Jake?!
Just like old times, right, Jake? When we were blood, we'd follow each other in the jaws of death on a pale horse.
The Baker's Shard is on the other side ofthat. The Corridor of a Thousand Deaths.
NowughI'm the dog, and you're the tail! Now you chase me! You chase my dreams!
Oh crud! Jake, I love you! I love youuu!
