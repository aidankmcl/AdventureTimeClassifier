I think we all agree, the human must be stopped!
Squirrel! What happened with the apple?
Well a-course it was cursed! We're tryin' to stop the human!    Look, just do me a kindness and go get me some more nut milk.  Come on fellas! I feel like I'm the only one comin' up with ideas here, Lenny! How do you think we should stop the human?
Hey, yeah! We could put like a rug over it!
What are you doing regular, nonflying squirrel? Put that back!   How dare you!  Well alright! Everybody after those...two!
