Pbht!
I'm Kent!
Someday, you'll be Kent's food.
Oh wow.
I don't know.
Oh. Okay, brother.  Boo-oop. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop!
Hyah!  A bad guy. Ah! Let's fight!  Aaah! Hey, get back here! Don't run! I'm super new at fights. And at being alive.
Who are you?  Where am I? Why do my parts hurt?
Pbht!
Oh. Oh, okay. What's a rat king?
I'm from my brother's butt. Maybe.
So, he's a bad guy?
That means I got to fight him. That's what my brother said to do! Where's my sword?
Oh...bummer.
What do I do?
Boo! Cool, cool.
Hey, man. I'm looking for some unbreakable ore. Y'all got that here?
No, I'm good. Just the ore, please.
Nah, I just don't care about money. My name's Kent. I'm supposed to fight bad guys.
Ha, ha!  Boop, boop, ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop, boop, boop, boop.  Whoop, whoop!
My name is Kent, and if I had a sword I'd totally fight you. But for now, I'm looking for a clod of mystic earth.
Nah, I don't care about being a good husband or wife or whatever. All's I care about is fighting bad guys.
Dude, you know why I'm here!
Um...I was born earlier today, so I don't really get a sense of my own mortality. No, thank you.
I name this sword..Punch Party!  I feel so cool right now.  It's party time.  Whoa! Uh!
Who's there?
I-I've got, like, this rad sword, and...I'm gonna fight you with it.  Yes!
What?
You're messing up the tree, and I totally live here! You're a bad guy!
Don't do that!
I'm...making...this...up...as I go!
You were the first friend I ever had.
