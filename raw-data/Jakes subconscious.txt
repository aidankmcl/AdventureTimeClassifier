You're right, Jake. It is exhausting.
I'm your subconscious!
I'm here to tell you that what you're feeling deep down inside is true! It is way too hard to swim across the river. It's easier to wear a hat.  Here! Have a hat!
Come on, dude. It's the only way to save Finn.
Aw...
I'm dyin', Jake.
Because... I'm the subconscious of your old magical self.  Goodbye, Jake...
