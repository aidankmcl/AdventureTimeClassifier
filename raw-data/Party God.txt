I am the Party God!
Jake... you have won my favor for being a completely off-the-hook party dog!
And because your gut waves please me so, I will grant you one wish! What do you want most in the world?
Then your wish is my...
Uh...  Y-y-y-yes, y-y-you got me. ...To grant your wish, I will have to fill you with the energy of a thousand partying demons! You will become so overloaded with party energy that you will demolish everything in your path!!Party, party, party! Ooouuuu!Hey, babe, is that a zit on your face? Gross.  You've seen my boombox? I totally puked in Jimmy's stereo and killed the party I was at, he was like, Hey, Party God, you can't spin faster than me! And I was like, I totally can, Jimmy. So we started spinnin', then I got super dizzy and was like: Blaugh blaugh, right into the speaker!  Hurr hurr, found it. Okay, I'm bouncing out, babe.
Oh... yeah... uh well, um, I'm sort of in the middle of party, so...
But, eh, I puked in Jimmy's stereo, I can't party-foul the party. I'm the Party God.
Don't be mad, babe.
Okay, laters- ouuu!
Ouuuu... I forgot the batteries.
Found them.  Huh, hey what's that?
Hmmm, oh whatever, what did you want to tell me.
Aye, yai yai, what?
Ugh! You're killing me babe, ouuuuu
Who are you?!
Whaaaat?!! Hey wait, you're the guy who's been living on her stomach.
There's going to be two hits, bro, me hitting you and a second instance of me hitting you.
