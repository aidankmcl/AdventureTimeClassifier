Mmmmmm, yes.
Eh...  I don't know. I'm not too worried about other people, I guess. Like, I got me, and they got them. Mm.
Um...
Oh... but I don't want to! I want both cupcakes. Finn can get his own cupcakes!
No! I don't have to do anything that I don't want to. They set me free, and free means I decide what I do, not them and not you!
Lemonhope's got feet that take him to fun.  Lemonhope's got meat that's warm in the sun.  Lemonhope's got no future plans, fully undeterred. No shirts,  no pants,  no won'ts,  no can'ts.
My body's free like a li'l baby bird. Caw! Lemonhope's got legs that'll strut hot struts. Lemonhope's got thighs that'll pump both butts. He's... got a harp, s'got a flute, free to strum,  free to toot! Free from PB-gum, I'm a lemon of  freedom!  Oh. It's warm.
Oh, man, that thing looks just lousy with freedom... straight-up right out the diddle-doo, comin' at ya right straight up. Ha-ha!
Yeah, exactly.  A-ha-ha-ha!  Wha-a-at? Okay...  It takes all kinds, I guess!
Oh, my fontanelle. Hello? II accidentally came on to your boat,  butbut I think I really need some help.
A lot of nightmares again. I guess that's freedom for you. Oh.
Mm.  Thirsty.  Nothing like juice for breakfast.  Oh. I guess that's the rest of those.  Well, I guess if there's no juice, I got freedom to go find water.
Huh. Weird cloud's still there.  Couldn't rain a little, could ya? Huh, cloud? Eh, what are you gonna do? Freedom not to rain, I guess.
Lemonhope's got meat that's warm in the sun. My lemon of...  freedom!Who are you?
Mm-hmm.
Mm...
Oh, I can't read. They tried to teach me in school, but... mm, I just faked it.
No! Phlannel! Stop the ship! Stop the ship!
STOP THE SHIP!
Oh.
Oh, my gosh, Phlannel, yes!  It's a dream come true!  A dream come true! A dream come true...
Poor little Lemonhope.  Throw me a lemon-rope. Is there a home for me and my harp? A place where my  friends... give me hu?
It's not that, Phlannel. I had a bad dream.
I'm free now, Phlannel, to do all whatevs I ever wanted, but all I think about is my old life. What does it mean?
Huh. That's what Mistress always said, and I didn't even listen.
I'll... I'll go back, and I'll help my people, and maybe I'll feel better.
Um... with my harp  and... my flute!  And help from my friend Phlannel!
Lemonhope's family held in Lemongrab's lair. Saving them will save me, but... I am pretty scared.
Hmm...
I didn't say anything.
Hmm?
Coming!
Wait, I'mI'mI'm coming!
Hello? HHello?
Is he gonna stay like that?
Nah, that's okay.
I mean, you guys are cool and all, but I mostly came back here so I could stop thinking about y'all all the time. I'll be back when I'm tired of being free.  See you in a thousand years, I guess. Peace!Oh, hi.
My name is Badlemon Nohope, but you can call me Lemonhope.
Thank you, mistress.
Yes, mistress.
I was sharp at the harp, now it's my turn to learn the flute to boot!
Mistress! Mistress, look! Something scary is happening now!
Yes, mistress.
