Haha!  Hey, chicken, you're travelin' egg-spress!
You get my joke, right?! Hahaha!
We're havin' so much fun, huh?!
Huh?
My name is Donny, idiot!
What kinda houses are you supposed to be? A... stupid... uh... a dumb house?! Haha! Hey, what's with your jowl?!
Hahaha! I'm gonna mess with these housies some more.
So you wanna wrestle, huh? 'Cause I know, like, this ninja move to get out of this lock instantly! Okay... Now, first I...  Hey! You're doin' it wrong!!
Whaddaya mean?
Like this?
Hey!
No... but if you need to, we can stop...  Ya baby.
Yeah, well, you're okay, too.
...For a complete idiot!
I was just kiddin' around, but then you took it too far! You guys are the real jerks!
What?
Muuuh... I don't know. Messin' with these housies is pretty fun. You got somethin' better?
Really?!  I mean... if it keeps you from cryin'...
Uh... This fort isn't so great. Not as cool as the fort I'm gonna build.  I call this chair!
You put on some pants!
Huh?!
Urgh!! This game cheats!
What? What'd I do?
Everybody's gettin' mad at me for nothin'!
Ohh. Hmm. I don't understand at all.
Uh... Empathy, empathy, put yourself... Ohh! So it's like, when I squeeze eggs outta chickens, I should let them squeeze eggs outta me, too!
Jake! Someone broke your... um... entire living room!
Ah! Master Finn has returned!
Thanks to you, I shall never be jerky again!
Steady on, Finn. Perhaps you are dehydrated! It's as Jake taught me:  8 ounces, 8 glasses, 8 days a week!  I'll fetch you some tap water.
Surely!  Gotta get pants! Go get your pants! Button, fly! I wrote that one myself. Perdoname.
I have no intention of being a jerk again. Hmph.
It sounds tragic, but I'm turning over a new leaf!
Finn, no means, no. I'm sure you'll respect my wishes.  No! Stop! No!
No! I'll use my musical messages to stop them!  Let's see... I've got one on the ethics of laundry... Crosswalk-ery... Ooh! Here's a good one!
Comb your hair right! It's a good time! Sticky, sticky pomades, short back and sides!   Why isn't anybody paying attention to my words?
Wha?!
But... but I've changed! Why would they say that?!  Empathy, empathy, put your mind insi...
Rrrrr... Think I'm a jerk do they? I'm feelin'.. obnoxious!!  HEY, YOU WHY-WOLVES ARE COOL! JUST KIDDING!  HAHAHAHA!!
Get offa' me, nerds!!
What?! You're the jerk!! Housies! Ready to hear my new song?! It's about how Finn will betray you, just to save lives!
I'll never forgive you, Finn!!  WAAAAAAH!!!
Hey! I love bein' a jerk! Thanks, Finn! Finn?  Finn, you loser!  I'll never... forget you!
