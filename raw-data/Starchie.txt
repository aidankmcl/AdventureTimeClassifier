Nope.
Yeah, that was tight.
Oh, that's some smelly.Hey, deh-deh-deh!Whoa!
Over here, fellas! Next stop, the Candy Kingdom. Previous stop, this weird place.Oh, my, that's a lot of zombies down there. Starchie's glad he's up here.  Dang it!Ahh, Kenneth.
Glad you could make it. I officially call this meeting of the veritas brigade to order.  Lux in tenebris.
So, anybody have weird stuff to report?
Whoa, this is some good stuff. We are this close to finally exposing the princess' shady dealings.  Meanwhile, PB remains blissfully unaware up in her ivory tower.
Whoa, Kenny boy, you're blowing my mind.
Hey, Peace Master.  Ohh!  Oh! My noodle.
It's all cool, Peace Master. Truth sleuths keep it real.
Alright, Peace Master. We'll be ready.  Mm. Dill-icious!
Oh, this is a mistake. That's my boy, Peppermint Butler.
You can't do that to our friend!Ahh! Get it off!Princess? It's me, Starchie the gravedigger. I brought you a larger corpse shovel. Oh, Princess? Well, I'll just wait for you here, then. By the mausoleum. With my back turned. And my defenses lowered.
Mornin'.
I can't help it. Flesh is delicious!
Don't squeeze me! I'll fart!Starchie's a beelzebub!Come on, Crunchy. You're the go-to guy. You're the new Cinnamon Bun.
Or... maybe they kissed so much they passed out! Crunchy, open that door!
You smell.Who are you talking to?!
NNNNOOOOOOOO!!!
Yeah, right... If Starchie ever survives that long...Oh, Starchie is very interested in this topic. What led you to this discovery, caller?
Hold up. Princess? Is that you?  Ah, spooky.Heah, even old Starchie's sick.
Starchie's feeling healthy again!  A bit too healthy if you ask me.Noooooo! Get away from me, you butchers!
Starchie only takes magic!
Find me a wizard!
Is that a real spell?
Princess, you're being really disrespectful of my beliefs!
H-hurry, princess.
Eh? Finally! Healing magic. Oh, I can feel it!
No!In your dreams, you freak!
