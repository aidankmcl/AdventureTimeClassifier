I'm the leader.
Hey guys, it's the picture of one of the perpetrators. Take a good look.
I need to see the other twenty-four pictures.
What? How can one picture identify twenty-five perpetrators?
Oh okay, I see. There's twenty-five of them! They all look like this guy!
You mean they're viginti-quintuplets?
What are clones?
I love long stories.
And they're not brothers?
Hey you, stop!
Have you seen this guy?
You two stop too!  Show them the picture!
Have you guys seen this guy?
Let me see that picture again.
Hmm... Hmm...  What's your name?
What's your name?
You're all named James. Is it because you guys look alike?
Y'know, I was telling this to the guys... If, if we look alike, we should have the same name. It would just make it a little easier. Life, that is. It would make our life a little easier.  Aah... Give me a second...  Same name... Look alike... You really look alike... Brothers! You're all brothers?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven-
Hmm... Twenty-five... Not brothers...   I think these are the twenty-five that are not brothers.  Perpetrators! Get to them!
