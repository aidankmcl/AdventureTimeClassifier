So what? You're not talking to me now?
Why are you mad?
But you're acting like you're mad.
I spin webs, too, Ed.
I try just as hard as you.
I can't! You think I'm gross when I spin my web!
I can see it on your face! Tell me that you don't!
Oh, get stuffed, Ed!
Hey, what's going on here!
Where's Ed?
He does? Really?
Ed?
Oh, Ed, I can't believe it!
I really just, it's just so unlike you to--  What's this?
In the woods?
You got this for you, Ed.
We are never gonna snuggles until you learn to appreciate me!
I'm gonna eat you!
Who cares!
You little twerp! Are you stupid or something?
Oh, Ed. We're parents!
We can make a new start, as a family.
