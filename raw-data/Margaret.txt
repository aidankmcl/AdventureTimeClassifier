There, there, baby. You're going to be a fighter.  Just like your mother.  Yes!  Barrel roll.  Ugh!
Let's get started.
Oh, good one, dear.  Hey, after dinner, what do you say we check the ticker-type for new cases?
Oh, come on, Joshua. Even with this ankle-biter, I'm as quick as ever. Sure, my waist is bigger, but that just means more bullets in my ammo belt.
I can take care of myself just fine. And besides, these babies  don't come cheap. We need to work together as a team to bring in the bread.
Now let's get over to that ticker-type and look for some perps.
Hey, that sounds fun. Let's do that.
What?
Joshua, look!  Something way larger than Wyatt made them. These tracks look real.
Come on, Joshua!
Ha ha!
Hmm. The tracks end here.
I'll show that peepsie the pepper!  Joshua, dear, I'm stuck!  Joshua! The beast outflanked us!
Joshua!  Drop that daddy!  Baby cakes! Oh, this is all my fault!
Don't.  Don't be melodramatic, Joshua.  I've been doing some research. Listen here. I think if we can get a sample of that creature's venom, we can use it to synthesize an antidote.  Joshua?!  Oh! Puddin' Pie!
You're about as fine as a canary in a cat mine!  Oof! Hey, where's the fire, kiddo? You stay put.  So's I can keep tabs on you.  Feel better. Over.
I got the peep peep's trail. In pursuit.
Joshua, I've stumbled upon the beast's lair.  Just hang on, Honey Bunny. Over.  Stay right there.  What?!  Ooh! Not yet!  Come on, come on!  What? What's your angle, slick? You poison my hubby, then play the innocent?  And what's with all this baby paraphernalia? Wait a tick. Are you a baby?
Oh, no! I must've scared the dickens out of you!  There, there, baby. I'm so sorry... For this!  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Joshua, I got the venom!  Ohhh! Uh oh, this baby business is getting SERIOUS!  Joshua!  Ohhh! Ohhh!
Something's about to happen with me too!
Well, I think you'll look good in one.  Are you sure having him next to Jermaine is safe? We don't even know what he is.
That he is.
Agreed.Give it here Joshua. This baby needs love and kisses to be happy.  There. See? Now its happy.
