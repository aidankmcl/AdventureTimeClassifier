Greetings, young heroes to be. This mountain is called Cragdor. Its purpose is two-fold: To protect the Enchiridion and to test the hearts of those who seek to possess it. Many noble challengers have entered the temple to pass the grueling trials that lie behind these walls, but no one has ever left here alive or dead! Only the truest most worthy hero can receive the heroes' Enchiridion and walk out these doors again! If it is you, friend,  and I cannot say that I am certain, but you are verily welcome to try; However, first you must pass my riddle. My name is Key-per, and duly so, for I carry the key to this door, but all is not how it appears, you see. Or perhaps you do not see at all.  Perhaps the key is in you, child, but you cannot use your brawn here. The door is magically sealed.
Oh ho! You've unlocked the riddle of the door.  Brilliantly done, child! Please, reveal to me how you unraveled my clue.
Oh, yes. That's how most people get in.
You've passed the first trial, young heroes, but prepare yourselves!  For there are many trials ahead of you, and each trial is more treacherous than the last.
Congratulations, Finn the human. Now you have truly reached...
Ooh!
These are my pajamas. I was getting ready for bed.
It's true!
