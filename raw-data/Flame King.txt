What's the word?
Uh... have my baby sent into the wilderness of the outside world to perish.
What do you want, princess of the Gum World?
I-I don't remember losing anything.
Okay, you got me. I had her sent to wander in the woods. I was in fear of being usurped. Come on.
Pssh, fine.
Right, can you believe this nonsense? Once I get outta here, I'm gonna ground you for real. No snacks, no friends, no popular music.
But I did it for you, honeyfor you not to overthrow me like you just did.Man, I am so lost.
Psh, kill the Flame King?    This is treason disguised as a play!  Guards, seized them!
Hmmmmm, search them!
Sickos!  Off with their heads!
Wa-wa-wait, wait. That voice.  Guards, take off their hoods.
Furnius and Torcho!
Arrest the executioners!
Hmmmm,  I thought I had you two extinguished.
Oh, yeah! Hehe.  Take them to the punishment room!
All evil.
She's evil.
Hmmmmm, well, there'd be penalties to her experience, if she acted out of alignment. But, yes, someone could change her.
Change her to good?
Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil.... EVIL!!!
Aah!Hmmmmm.... What do you seek? Speak!
A prince?!
Bold words, but know you that my daughter is a rare jewel. She cannot be wooed by just any ragamuffin prince!
Silence, my molten mommas.  We are perplexed. If you are a baron true, where is your gift? 'Tis common practice among visiting dignitaries.
Hmmmm.... Three is more than one.
Prince Finn has smoked my jester! Pourquoi?! Why?! ...I do hate my jester.
A fire inside my body?! I am disgusted! Give me your third terrible gift and be on your way!
Is that him? He looks terrible! Why isn't he here? Why did he send his buffoon?! Leave now, buffoon, for you have failed!
A koala bear?
I don't like koalas anymore. Begone!
Excellent!
You have indeed proven yourself! Any prince ruthless enough to kill his own buffoon would make an excellent boyfriend...
... for my evil daughter!
She's an unstoppable force of destruction. Ahhhh, nothing a psycho like you can't handle. Congratulations!Oh, here he comes!
Yes! Playtime's over, honey. Time to give Daddy his throne back.  I've secretly arranged to make Don John my vizier and give him my daughter's hand in marriage.
Ha-ha!
Man, you're looking shredded.
Okay, okay.
Splendid work, Don John.
Heavens to Betsy!
Don't let them escape!
Huh? Aah!
Why did I jump?
Whoo! Whoo! Man, I love staring out over things. Whoo!  It's so good to be king.
Umm, okay...
Liar? You want to fight me?
Yes... I'll fistfight you. Come on!
Oof! I love fistfighting.  You dirty bread breaker.
No!
Fight!
Leg press!
Uh-oh.
It wasn't me. It was Don John!  Aah!
Have you all gone dumb from Don John's magic? I mean, how do you expect this softy to rule you? She's even weaker than before from being poisoned. Look!Evil...evil...evil...evil...evil!
Oh, well, uh... Sorry, I... thought my daughter was alone... Well, I'll just be going now. Nice teapot.
