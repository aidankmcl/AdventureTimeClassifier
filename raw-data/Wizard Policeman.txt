Stand back, citizen.
Stranson Doughblow, you are guilty of impersonating a wizard, as well as purchasing magic items from Ron James' Spell Palace.
The sentence is...
You're busted!
You are guilty of harboring non-magic users!
Receive your just punishment!
Come on! Move it!  You two, in here! I got cells upstairs for Princess and Milkface.
Prisoner, drop that contraband magic!
