...So then he was telling me to beef in the eye of Glob and stuff.
Heck yes, I did.
Sorry, man.  Nothing personal.We are Bufo!
So... you wish to be inducted into the ancient order of Dang it, Leonard!! If we don't talk at the same time, nobody can understand us!
Ahem... So... You want free wizard powers... Powers like...  these!
Then follow....
Behold the Grand Hall of Wizardry!  This is where young potentials train to become Ultimate Wizards! Most are not ready for the responsibility that comes with it.
Yes, yes... very responsible. Now I bestow upon you these wizard cloaks!
Fine, fine. Now for every power that you accrue,  you shall receive a star badge like these.  This final star betokens the rank of Ultimate Wizard!
Level 1Dustomancy.
To receive this power, you must first...  eat these brooms.
Calm yourself, boy.  You are acting hysterical. Do you not see that you are using Dustomancy? Behold...
Yes. Mastery over all dust motes. You can also read their emotions. For instance, this mote is very unhappy in his marriage.
Are you ready for more magic?
So much more... like Level 2... the power of... Shadowcery!  You can't see through those, right?
To gain provenance over the shadows, place your hands into  this bowl!
No! Cover your eyes!
Thrust your hands into this bowl... of eyeballs.
No! They're eyeballs...  Well done. You have groped the eyeballs fearlessly.
Excellent.
Well done.
To tell true, the last power is not free.
No, no cash. For the final star, you must take the pledge of ultimate responsibility.
Are you sure? Perhaps you are not sufficiently familiar with
Well, there may be ramifications that you cannot
My word, I've never met someone so irresponsibly responsible. Very well, then. You must... grasp my hand.
Direct your attention to the scale-model orb.
Yes. It's been heading for this temple for 847 years. Only the magic of the ultimate wizards keeps it from getting any closer. Quickly, add your power to that of the orb.
Now I release the elder Jeremy from his pledge. Razzamafoo!
And you take his place... for the rest of your natural life.
This is what you signed up for when you took the pledge of ultimate responsibility.
I tricked you, of course... but would anyone really volunteer to do this?  I'm out.
Hey! Have you gone crazy?! Get back in the bouncy harness!
You are! Uhh...
Don't forget to thank me. For this was my plan for all of these 847 years.
Perhaps you're right. No more giving out free powers. I hereby renounce all magic.  My life is oveeeeeer!
I don't?
Oh... okay...  Good idea...  Glad I thought of it...Yeah, when the lamb comes back, Laser Wizard puts him on the altar.
Right, yeah, that's the plan.
What part of secret society don't you understand?
Barrier!
