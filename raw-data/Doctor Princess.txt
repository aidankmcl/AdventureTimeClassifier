Well, switch back to water. But what I really want to know, is how are you feeling Finn?
Okay, that's what I thought. You gotta bounce back, man. You got burned by your bad dad, you lost your arm, and all the ladies say you don't talk to Flame Princess no more.
Finn, flowers thrive on good vibes. As your doctor, I'm ordering you to go out and have fun, okay?
Uh, what? Like... as a date?
Finn, I don't date my patients.
Okay. Tell her I said hi.Whew!
