Go away.
They broke the door! The door is broken now!
It doesn't matter anymore.
Hmm. No, no. You do not understand. It is not us for whom they starve, but them...
Mm! Yes, yes! For the candy food was not consumed--no, no--but was given life!
You see, Finn,  when Mother Princess last visited Lemongrab...
...she left behind a little something-something: the secret formula for creating candy life! She must have meant for us to have it, to keep making more family.
What? What'd you say?
Oh, indeed! For once we had commenced, how could we desist?
Me, too.
...and hearing each new piercing song!
Mm. I thought we said Dump-Dome.
Oh, yes.  Hmm, mm-hmm, mmhm. Yes.
Ha-haaa! We'll call you Seed-Wad!
Our... boys?
Yes. Okay.
But first we will notify the children of our impending departure...
Okay, yes. The hard times are over!
We will go to the Candy Kingdom and take all their candy from them! Then we will give that candy precious life and build a candy army so we may then go forth and pillage candy for all to eat!
Go! Go!
It's all  your fault!
We warned you!Hm-m-m.
No, he wants to dance!
We hate you.
O-O-Only O-O-O-ONE!!!How are you today? Mm, I see. Yes. I'm inside my fortified totalitarian city-state. Hello, I'm Lemongrab.
Mm. Unacceptable.
Things have never been better here at Castle Lemongrab.
I have never been fatter.
And since the expulsion of Lemonhope...
We have reached peak societal obediency.
Law, order...
Harp-smashing.
We've have it all!
Mm, the pleasure. Smash another! Ooh, who is this?
I'm one of my subjects! I'm being punished for helping Lemonhope. But that's okay!
Yes, morale has never been higher since we got rid of hope. In conclusion, no one needs to come here ever, especially Lemonhope, and I ate my brother. Goodbye!
I'm going to eat you!
I did it!Looking for something?
Well, you found me, fat Lemongrab.
Oh, what's that you've got? Ah-ha, your little harp? But what's this?  I've got things in my ears tonight! So now I'm invincible!
What? Ispeak up, child!
What?
Oh, the harp! Didn't I just explain? I've got things in my
Mymymy things!
LetLet me go! Let me go!
This sounds awful!
I can't stands no more!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!Awake.  Avast, hold tight your buns, if buns you do hold dear; for time has come to wake and run and not give way to fear!
I'm reading the wall.  They are wall words.
I no longer need this map. I have infallible recall.
Enough of this!
This is wrong. The map lied to me-e. It doesn't want me to find the EXIT! Ice King, h-how do you taste?
Mild or SPICY?!
Make yourself into food! Now!
Make them fast, servile.
I am sorry. Make pies, slave.
No!  Acceptable.
WHAT?!
That door will lead us closer to the exit!
WOOAH! WUOAGH!
OUGHF! MY JUICE!! MY VITAL JUICES!!!
MOMMY!!!
The hidden door! Hohuugh..
My vital essence depleted... Must.. replenish...
Nugh.. That'll do, Slave Trunks. To the spiraling ledge!
Yes.
This door leads to the center exit!
Essence.
You serve no function, you must be destroyed!
Bye, don't follow me.Princess!
Oh, so pleased and gracious to welcome you to our sophisticated society!  Bow.
NO! Do it now!
No, you're floating too high!  It's time for the floor show!
No! Lemons only! Floor show!
Do it better!
WHAT?! UNACCEPTABLE!
What?! UNACCEPTABLE!
UNACCEPTABLE!
That noise! That ugly lemon and his ugly noise!
No. He needs to stay here.  I hope you'll still be joining us for dessert.]
Ah, my pud! I'm going to enjoy this pud. I'm really looking forward to this pud.  Oh, what is this?
Dungeon!
How dare you? How dare you release my prisoners? Soft Lemongrab! Softer than an old graham cracker! YOU'RE SOFT!!
How dare you? How dare you? After all I've done for you?! You try to steal my Lemonhope away?! You're too old, princess. Too old for pranks. Too old!  I've tried imprisoning! I've tried reconditioning! You leave me no choice. Lemon Children!  Go forth! Go forth now!
