Aaah!!!
Eh?
Oooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Please don't hurt me! You're in grave danger and it's all my fault!
Your hat accidentally touched my head flower. See?  My magic imbues anything it touches with an evil spirit, one that craves destruction and chaos. Yech.  I buried myself so that nothing would touch my body ever again, but then this bloom grew out of my head. C'est la vie!
I'm sorry, that's just the way my magic works.  Papa always said I was a bad wizard. Right, Papa?! Baby's a bad wizard. A bad wizard, huh?! You're a bad wizard!  I'm a bad wizard!
Okay.
Aaah, horsey!
All my fault. All my fault!
Oh, gleeble snoots!
Whomever the hat possesses gains the proportional strength of a hat!  Look out! He's got the horse again!
Sorry, fellas. I don't thrive in conflict situations!
I can't! All I can do is think about my papa and how much I disappoint him!
Like... my mommy? When I came home with bad grades from wizard school, my mommy used to hug me, and hug me,  Ooh, Mommy!
O-Okay, let's try this.  I... love my mommy?
Ooooh, it worked!  I love my mommy! I love my mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Hi, Mommy!
Mommy.
Nownow rise up, love buddies,  and hug your gross brother into submission!
Thank you, my newly conscious bros. Now return your life forces to me.
Ymmom!
Okay!  Mommy.
No, I-I, oohI guess I am. Huh.
I will. Way better than my papa was to me.Yo, yo, yo!
Inspire us, water nymphs!
Eh, I don't really want to.
Uh, okay, but I am not a confident driver.
Don't touch me!
Oh! Let me try this!  Mommy!
Ymmom! Somebody! Sorry.
