Please, don't steal anything from me!
Ahh!
Oh, it was terrible. I was trying to sell my flowers out here in the desert, when these two thieves came and stole my whole basket! Then ran into the city.
My name is Penny.
Finn, it's hopeless to try stopping a thief here. Everyone steals from each other. It's redoodoodiculous!
Redoodoodiculous?
Hey, my basket! That's my basket!
This is fun, Finn!
I have an idea! My mom used to tell me that there's a King of Thieves who lives in the center of the city, and everything that gets stolen from little girls ends up at his tower. Maybe we'd find my basket in his treasure chest!
There's one thing, though. The tower that he lives in is surrounded by a magical barrier. Which magically keeps thieves out.
The King of Thieves' tower is right up here.
I'm too afraid! Is it okay if I wait out here?
Legend says you'll find the loot in the King of Thieves' chest. Good luck, Finn! Oh, yeah, and that high window is the only entrance.
The chest! Gimme that!
Of course it's not! I set you up to steal this chest of gold! I couldn't get past the barrier 'cause I'm a thief!
And, I'm a thief!
Because you stole something in the city! Now you're a thief!
You've become a thief, stupid!
Mmm. Yes. Yeah.  Wha? Is someone there?!
Finn, please don't punch my lights out! I'm just a poor, homeless baby girl.
I'm sorry, Finn.  Let me give you some uh, gems, or some gold, or uh, have some  knife in your neck!
You may have soiled my purity, but I think you can still come out clean.  C'mon, Jake!
No! No!
I feel...clean! Like all the filth of the city and wrongdoings are gone! Thank you F and J! I haven't felt like this since I was young!
Finn, thanks for the second chance to live a pure life.
Never again.
I'm going to miss you, Finn!
G'bye!
