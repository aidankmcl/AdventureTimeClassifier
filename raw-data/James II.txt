Uh, I'm James number 2. The original James got all goopy in the desert.
Well... I was lonely! I knew Princess Bubs would make a new James if, you know, a James died a hero. So...
Yeah! I just wanted a friend.  Someone who gets me!
Plus, each time I get kerplonked, I get another shiny medal, and why have two medals if you can have all the medals? Medals, medals, medals...
What? The medals make me happy. Plus, PLUS! It's a constant party here in  Jamestown!
Wait, don't tell her! I'll give you a medal.
Wah, no fair.
Man, we do deserve them medals. It's not like she can give them to someone else. I wrote my name on all of them.
Princess!
James are a heroes! See?  Vrow-w-w-w!
