Hey, Tree Trunks!
Tree Trunks! Up here!
Hey Tree Trunks!
Hey! Tree Trunks! How are you!
Yeeeeesss. Just readin this book.
What? I-uh. Uh. Oh. Oooh!  I get it!And so it was decided... that once every year when the weather got chilly, that Finn, Jake, the Ice King, BMO, Princess Bubblegum, Marceline the Vampire Queen, Cinnamon Bun, Peppermint Butler, Phil, a candy cane man, one of the gumdrop girls, Lady Rainicorn, Lumpy Space Princess, that guy, the other guy, a pig, Tree Trunks, a two-headed duck, the old crazy Tart Toter, the punch bowl, a booger, and Gunter... would get together while wearing really big sweaters and watch videos on the floor next to a fire... to celebrate the day when Finn and Jake had a fleeting moment of empathy for the biggest weirdo in Ooo. It was a miracle. Good night.Hey, Dancing Bug! Uh, come on, man. Shake it.
What? Hey, I got moves, too, guys.
No. I'm gonna do parkour.
Haha!  Parkour!  Ah, oh no. I really hurt myself.  Guys, I'm so dumb!
Ugh. Hey, somebody forgot theiroh, cram!  Um...who are you?
Oh. There's-There's a note. Hey, dude, the tip of your tail got snipped off, so now you have a little brother. We named him Butty Butterson. Signed, the other bugs.  I'll call you Kent for short.
Jake..Jake!
It's fine. I was goofing off, got hurt. Now I got a little brother. I named him Kent.
Whoa! A talking brother.
Myth is a powerful force in my life, dude. So the thing is, I don't know beans about being a big brother. Can you give me some tips?
That's it?
Alright. Sounds good.
Hey, how'd you do that?
Hmm. Okay, Kent. This is real important. You're my little brother, so your purpose is to fight bad guys. So go fight some bad guys. Or girls. Don't discriminate.
Having a brother around looks kind of fun.  Where are you? Little Brother? Are you happy?  Or do you feel weird? Have you changed a lot? Or not? Are you ever gonna come back here? I shouldn't have been so hasty. You were just a little baby. Or maybe you weren't. I'm not really sure how little brothers work.
Whoa!  Kent proceeded his fantastic journey to me. It was all super good. But he had also partaken of the food of the underworld, and so he was compelled to return there by dewdrop law. That's what he said, at least. Maybe he was having second thoughts about infinite riches, true love, and eternal life. Or maybe he had just decided that fighting bad guys wasn't really his deal.  But I do know thisfree from the rat king's cursed teeth, that spring, for the first time in many years, the willow tree was in bloom.Hi Jake.
Why you looking so down in the dumps?
No response, huh? Guess you're good.
Hmm?
Hey, Jake, why don't you just hang out with both of them at the same time?Where am I? Tree Trunks, what's going on?!
Behind each door, on every floor, danger, danger, ever more.
It's a map!
Uh, Lemongrab?
Never mind.
I think I have an idea.
That's a girl, Tree Trunks! You can do it!
This is gonna work out just fine.
Ugh!
Faster, TT!
Uhhh ... what is going on here Ice King?
Yeah..but no, thanks.
Uh..You should've told us! I would've freaking brought something!
Hey, Jake can I catch you a ride back home?
Ice King was doin' some... desperate business, but it didn't work out.  He seems pretty bummed out 'bout it.
Me, watching this.Wait, what do I say? Mmmm, Check please-
Mmm, check please!You can just call me Shelby.
Check, please.
Do you, Todd Johnson, take this Rainicorn to be your lawfully married wife?
Check, please.Hello.
So, I wish for ... a pony for my GF!
Sorry, dudes. My girl's been hounding me for a pony for months. I'm gonna get mad points for this.   Oh, hi! So you got it? That's great! You like him? Uh huh ... you gonna name him what? Speedboat? Yeah, that's a good one.
