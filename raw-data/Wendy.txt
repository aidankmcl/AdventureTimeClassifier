Hey.
Come on, Marceline! you're gonna turn these goofballs?
When did you go all soft? You used to like teaching people about kicks.
We do. It's to let them die!
Way to go, Marceline.
Hey! Let's invite them to our place! When they show up...
Yeah, you guys were pretty amazing.
We'll see you at midnight at our place.
You know you're not even real vampires.
