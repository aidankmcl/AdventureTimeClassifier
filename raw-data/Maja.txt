That's my private box. Maja's mitts only, ya goof.
That's right. He was a weenus so I wrote it on there as my personal joke.  But the sale is still legit. Hambo's mine! His body's all juice-logged with sentimental affectiona savory spell spice. So get out of my face, alright?
She's busy with my Crabbit... crow-bit... crow-rabbit. I knew that tranch wouldn't respect my proof of purchase. So what about you, bozo?
So what are you gonna do about it?
Huh-duh! I let them!
I made a trade... for this!  Bing!  Mmmmm.  Sentimental freshness! Ah, the psychic resonance on Hambo is nothing  compared to this baby!  WHOO! Hahahaha!
That's cool. Then why don't you dance to this?!
Nice moves!  Now you're the weenus!  Hey, don't go!  Ahahahahaha! I'm cookin' up something big, Crabbit! This is my victory lap! Ahahahahaha!Give up now, Princess, and I, Maja the Sky Witch, promise not to completely donk up your kingdom.
Oh, well.  What can you do?
Keepers of the clock, masters of dimension, bear witness!
By my power, I compel you to converge!
Past and present, be one. Awaken the terror of a forgotten age in this moment that is all moments in the blink of an eye.
Darren, the ancient sleeper, arise!
Yes. You want to go conquer the Candy Kingdom?
It's a place that contains the highest levels of caring and sentimental affection in all of Ooo.
It's a feeling I use in my magic to give me power. Like this shirt that was once the prized possession of Princess Bubblegum. With the feelings in this shirt, I was able to summon you.
All right.
Yes?
Yeah...
That's not my plan exactly, but you'll be fine. I promise.
Okay. We'll talk about that.
Hey! We'll talk about it!
Break this witch out, Darren.
Then do the thing!
Eat it, tranch!
Wait, Darren! Dial it back. I need her residual feelings.
What the slizz?!
The Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant?!
No!
Hello? Who's that? Why can't I see jack?
Um, all right. Are you, like, powerful?
Okay. I can run with this. Take me to the Candy Kingdom and shoot your laser nose at it.
What?
Ugh, that plan sounds like dirt!
Ah! It's bright! Wait! You're the flippin' elephant! You laser-nosed me! Somebody help! Oh, my Glob. Somebody!
