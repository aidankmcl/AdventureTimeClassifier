Alright, give me a second.
Man, I don't have patience for this animation junk. Whoever does this must have no life whatsoev
Oof... Why did I do that?
Hm, I don't think so.
Who's it from?
Escape, Jake! Escape!
Whaa? Aaaah!
The computer went...
The email...
Brick window with the plastic...
Banana hummingbird...
How do we stop the computer worm, you pile of goo?!
STOP TALKING LIKE A NERD AND GIVE IT TO US STRAIGHT!!!
Don't worry, Princess, we'll take care of this thing.
Okay!
Don't worry, guy! I got you!  YEOW! JAKE, HELP ME!!!
Come here, guy!
I'm trying to help you, yo!
But... No!! Jake, this isn't working! We need a plan.
THAT PLAN'S NOT GOOD!
Then talk to it I will.  Hey man, tell me the haps.
Jake, I think I found a way in!
There's no time!
AAAAH... AAH!!!
Huh? Ice King and Bubblegum?
Jake! Don't touch anything!
I think the shiny things are the building blocks of the universe, man! They store every single thing that is a thing back on thing!
Jake, what is it?
Come on, Jake, pull it together, man.
Jake?
That's the spirit!  ADVENTURE TI--!!!  Oh, my gams!! Hold up, dude, my body's changing!
We gotta get those things... outta his stomach.
Ugh, yeah.  Yeah!!
You should wash your mouth!
Seems like it.
Hey, have you seen the princess anywhere?
Ahem... Hey, Bubs, where's the Ice King? I wanna kick his boingloings!Okay!
Hey, Preebs.
For sure. We'll do it.
Holy--!
Jake? Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!
Aah! Sorry, dudes--got no food! No... food!  Hey!
Yeah. Cool, man. Hey, do you know where--?
Wait, what?
Yeah. What the heck's going on here?
Whatever, Lemonjon. We've gotta give those dumb-butts these seeds.
I don't know, but we gotta bust them out! Which way to the dungeon, Lemonjon?
Thanks, man!
Yo, Lemon-wipes!
Yeah, sure!
Oh, sorry dude.
Stay close to me.
All locked up!  There they are! Hey, Lemongrabs, we're here! We're gonna get you out, just hold tight!
Probably the grossest one of all, too--beet red skin, barf, poopin' all its junk-sculpture.
Lemongrabs, you're free!
Are you saying you locked yourselves down here with all the food so you could eat it yourselves?
Wha--?
Look. We brought these seeds.  They're special candy seeds.
...and all your boys, too!
Come on. We'll take you to see Princess Bubblegum. She knows more about candy than anyone; she built a whole kingdom out of candy!
What's going on, Lemongrabs?!
Yaaaah!  What the--?
Jake! Are you alright?
And he's too big to duke it out with! Unless...
No. We'll kick him in his heart 'til he's history. Those must have been Lemonjon's guts we saw before. His heart is his weak spot.
Oh yeah, that's probably it.  Whoaaa!  Oh, man!
Just smash it already, grandma.
Oh, nice one, Jake.
Whoa, dang!  That Lemonjon turned himself all up into lemon candy! Man, that Lemonjon's all right.
...and I snatched this  out of the Lemon castle, boyee!Hey, Jake, do you think you should date someone just like you or someone whos like your opposite?
So its not good to weigh someones qualities against your own?
Alright, well, what about BMO and Ice King?
Would they make a good couple?
No no!
Its not that weird! Come on!
Yeah!
Im just thinkin out loud.  What, cant think out loud?
Yeah man! Pffft, jeez dont be judgy.
Yeah, you are!
I can hear it in your tone.
Yeah, wise-guy.
What?! Not again!  Oh. I dont know.  Whoa, look.
What the--?
Hey, are you guys alive?  I dont know, man, I think theyre some kind of magic toy.
No, man, look! Thats you!  Youre totally shedding on the viola.
Dude. Like a lot. Come on! Lets check this out at the house.
Sheesh. So many. PB, you hang out with Lady.  C-listers, go back in the bag.
Tiffany, Donny.  Well, hes okay.  Xergiok... a bunch o' these guys!
Dont worry, man. Theyll get involved eventually.
I dont know. Involved. Check out Lady and Princess Bubblegum!
Its hard to say, but I think its got something to do with Lady being preggos .
Thats your narrative, buddy.
Hmm. Not much really. I got Ice King over here.
Yeah, well, I saw his drum kit in here. Here we go.  Okay, jam out, little Ice King.
Chemistry...
Yeees.
Whoooooa.
I didnt sleep.
Im not reading. Im playing with the little wees.
Uh, you guys broke up.
Shes with someone else now.
Hes a cool guy, dont worry about it.
What?
Come on, theyre not real, theyre like toys. These guys here, theyre goin out.  Pretty serious. And look at Choose Goose and Lollipop Girl. Theyre still testing the waters.  But I think things are gonna work out. Check out Xergiok and Turtle P.  Weird. But cool. Right, Jake?
Okay. Whatever whatevs.  Weird.  Huh?
I dont know.
Hes... thinking.
I dont know. Probably lots of stuff.
Probably still crying.
Shes not handling the break-up very well.
PB's good, though.  After little Finn dumped her, she started working out. Looks like shes really into it.
I know!
No, man! I gotta fix this mess! Look at me, man! Im staring into the shadow of my darkest mind hole! I gotta help him!
I junked them up too hard though! I gotta step in!
Im gonna talk to him.
Yeah, why is that?

Why?
Okay. Fiiiiiiinn! Fiiiiiiiiiinn!

Okay.  Fiiiinn. Can you hear me?
I made you do those crummy things. Im why yous guys is fighting. Im the big you. I came to apologize. I will never interfere with your lives again.  Dont worry I will take care of it.  Sorry, my arm got tired.  Never mind. Itll be fine. Goodbye, little Finn! Im not coming back!
Hey, ladies! This is big Finn! I caused all the problems! It wasnt anyones fault! Dont be mad at each other! Have a... dance party! Okay, goodbye! Im not coming back!Jake! Jake! Good mornin'! Whatcha doin', buddy?
What are you meditating about, dude?
Ha ha! Beep boop boop boop beep boop.
Huh, I like it. Yeeoow!
Whoa! Algebraic!
Well, let's go cheer her up. To the max!
Woo hoo!
Hey! What's wrong!?
Wanna hear a funny joke!?
Knock-knock!
Who's there?
Woowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoo, who?
Man, that wasn't very funny.
Aw, the Ice King is an oxymoron.
Survey the situation.
The Ice King is throwing frozen lightning bolts at the Rainicorn.
He's like 50 patoots!
The Ice King is always stealing princesses. We're going in turbo time!  You want your booties?
What time is it?
Penguins!
Mathematical!
Rhombus! Iceclops!
That was close!
Let's rock and roll!
Ice to meet you!
Snow Golem!
Elemental!
That way.
Snow problem!
I'm 12 years old!
Hey, Ice King! Stop it!
He's not my dog! He's my friend!
Why are you always stealing ladies?
That's... stupid!
My hat is awesome!  Where's Jake?
What's going on? Ab...Abraham Lincoln?
What?
Never!
Princess!
There you go, Princess. You are free.
Oh, I'm not a knight. I'm a boy.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Uh, nothing.
We got to go, okay, bye, Princess. Bye.
Heh, heh, yeah we do, buddy. Adventure awaits.
Heh, uh, look! Those ninjas are stealing that Old Man's diamonds!
Later, Princess! I have to attend to this!
Jake!Ooooh!
Pssst. She's going back!
Hello? Oh! Is that the machine part that I ordered?
Ac-cept-tance.
What, a jerk?
Now that's a time machine.
O-ho-ho, was it? Then how do you explain tomorrow's newspaper?No thanks.
Uh, Jake, can't we get rid of these Clown Nurses? They make me feel ridiculous.
Wait, what are they doing?  Whoa! Stop!
NO!! I just don't want you kissing my toe!
What does that even mean??
You're gross, man.  Look! Deep in the forest of trees, there's a Cyclops whose magical tears can heal any wound. See? See?
Huh? Wha?
Wait! Wait! Wait! There's another way! There's my way! Let me show you my way!
Ahh! Let me go!
MY WAY!!
Hmmm...
Isn't there another way?
But what if I just went
NO! I choose MY WAY!!  My way.
Wha...?  I need to cross the river. The Cyclops is over there.
But I need to get across.
Glob, Glob it, Glob it, Glob it...
MY WAY!!
NO, MY WAY!!
MY WAY!  Oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob.
MY WAY!
Whoops. Uh... man, I'm real sorry.
But... I can still help. I'll fix your house for you.
Uh... wh... I...
I was wrong. Was I wrong? No. Yes... Yes... I was wrong. How could it be? I trusted in my guts, but ended up all nuts. I was wrong. How could it be? Listened to my brain, but ended up insane. The melons rolled...over that lady. I went too far. How could it be?  How did I go... too far?
I don't want 'em anymore.
No. I hurt a small, hairy man's wife. I just wanna go home.
Dude! What's wrong with you? I said I don't want your tears!
I'M NOT LYING!!!
Fine. Whatever, man. Have it your way.
Huh?
I said... MY WAY!!
Magical tear drops.  My way can still work! Yeah!
Kiss that!
Hey, man. You want me to heal your toe with my magical goo?
You're gross.
You know what? You're... right.Ugh, what are you cooking?
I'm not eatin' that. It smells funny.
Let's go over to Tree Trunks's and get some apple pie! Apple pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Let's go!
Tree Trunks!
Tree Trunks! Tree Trunks?
Whoa, whoa!  Tree Trunks, it's us, Finn and Jake!
It's okay, Tree Trunks. We're here to help you. Just tell us what happened.
Don't you worry, Tree Trunks. We'll find those thieves and bring them to justice.
Hmm. Is anything else missing, Tree Trunks?
Hm. Well, I don't see any footprints. What'cha got, Jake?
Hm. Tree Trunks, is there anyone you can think of who might want to crunk you up?
Oh, hey, Raggedy Princess. Have you seen anything fishy going on?
Awesome. Where do we find these guys?
Uh, does Princess Bubblegum know about this place?
Oh, yeah. Try not to act suspicious, Tree Trunks.
Oh.
Oh,  Tree Trunks, you're so silly. But, but listen, you wouldn't happen to have seen anyI don't knowapples around, have you?
What? Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no.
Dang. They almost got us, but I think we blend in pretty well now.
Uh, Tree Trunks, don't eat that.  Here.   You gotta watch her, man!
You know where a guy might maybe score some apples?
Wha-what boss?
We don't know any Dr. J.
I guess these guys who stole Tree Trunks' apples also stole Dr. J's apples, and they thought we were workin' for him!
Hm?
Yeah, Tree Trunks, me too.
Hm?
Oh, that guy bopped me one. Must've had a ring on.
What?!
Hello?
Uh, we're here about the apples?
Um...
What the?
These aren't apples.
Aw, don't cry, Tree Trunks.
You mean apples that we eat?
No, Tree Trunks, that's preposterous.
Tree Trunks, you don't need to do this.
Tree Trunks.
Huh? Wait, what'd you say?
A scarecrow, no footprints, all those magpies on the roof, Raggedy Princess in the ditch, and all the apples in Tree Trunks's closet.
That's it!  I knew it!
The magpies have been stealing the apples and accidentally dropping them in this hole!
Yes. And the magpies were able to steal the apples because Raggedy Princess wasn't sitting on the fence post to scare them off!
Awesome! This calls for a celebration! You know what that means, Tree Trunks!Yeah. Oh, what about Jake?
Sounds really sweet.
Lumpy Space Princess? Is that you?
It's not your party, LSP.
Hey, everybody.Jake, so I just had this weird thought.
Well, I don't know. Isn't is sort of strange that we keep pets? We kind of make them worship us.
No, seriously, think about it, we're their only source of a food, water, and like tummy rubs. They basically have to love us.
Yeah, tummy rubs are pretty great, . That one star is so crazy, looks like it's vibrating  it's so cool. Wonder what it is, a planet? Do people live there? Are they friendly, do they keep pets?
Whoa... holy.  Oh dang,   Uh, okay  Man, this is screwy. Maybe it's the can of beans we had for dinner.  Looks- uh- homey. Wah-oh! Whoa-Aah!  Oh- right.
Aww
Oh! Hey, you can see me?!
Oh, forget it, it's cool.
Whop, here I go! Bye!
That guy seemed lonely, not a lot of foxes up at this hour.  Guess you get a lot of work done though.
Bounce House Princess. . I didn't know B.H.P lived in a cave.  Hey, this place is pretty nice.
Whoa!
Dude, what's your deal?
Aww, geez, poor Bounce House Princess.
Wha?
Gosh, I hope BHP's okay, I feel bad for just splittin' like that. Maybe they sorted it out, they could have stuff in common. You never know until you speak to the person.  Oh, hey, Cloud Kingdom.
What the? Ice King?
Poor Simon. Poor Simon, I guess? Poor Simon... sort-of? It's like some part of him wants to be a sad wong-lord.  But why would anyone want that? Is there some... incentive?
Sheesh, I wonder if being a sad loner gives you more raw material to form song ideas. Is that where creativity comes from? From sad-biz?  I am so high up now. I am so high up there is no high up, it's all just...  Whoa! What the? Whoooa!  Space Lards! Ah man, Jake would be flipping out; trying to get that super-rare milk. Make a sick flame with that milk. Oh, well.
Whoa! What's going on? You can't see me, right?
I'm in the Mother Lard! . What? Space birth!  Okay, here we go! Whoa!  Bye, guys. Oh, that was creative and it wasn't sad either so maybe birth is the greatest statement in all the universe.  Hey, baby, ya' gonna give me a boost? . Here comes Mars. What the heck is going on though?  Everybody's leaving.
Wha? Who, me? You can see me too?
Oh yeah. Hey, do you ever say Oh, my Glob?
Yeah, but, I gotta question.
Well, if just being born is the greatest act of creation.  Then what are you suppose to do after that?  Isn't everything that comes next just sort of a disappointment?  Slowly entropy-ing until we deflate into a pile of mush?
But what's it worth if we're all gonna get blowed up right now?
Ahhh!  Oh my bod!
...Glob is dead.
Hey, I think Bounce House Princess needs our help.Jake, is that you at the door?
I call 'not answer the door' then.
What's so funny?
Oooh, heh haha, that is pretty funny.JAAAAKE!
Jake, did you hide my sock?
So, what? It just magically disappeared?
Is that just a cute way of saying you took it?
Why don't you just help me find my sock?
I'm worried about BMO.
Yeah, I guess. But maybe it woulda been more fun with two socks!
Huh?
Whoa haha!  Right on, BMO!
Yay, BMO! Yay! Yeah!
Yay!BMO?
BMO, are you okay?
Come on BMO. We got to get you to the hospital or whatevs.
The MO Factory?
Tears in the oven?  But memories are real, real cruc'!
Hey BMO, check this out, too!  Meet FMO.
And I'm FMO!
Yes, absolutely. Thanks, DMO. I busted my core system drivers, and now I need new ones.
Oh, right, right. Uh, right. I mean, no. I'm just here for the... nostalgic purposes.
Wup!
I know, I heard!
None of these ports fit right! E, D, C, where's the B port?!
BMO, how are you doing?
Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down.  Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down.
Psych!
Down that grate!
Hang in there, BMO!
Hey, Jake! Can this thing go any fast-
Woah! Shoot, it's the fuzz!
Holy-
Uh, turn right!
Dog it, they're still behind us!
Turn left!
Turn Corkscrew!
Now go down!
There's a driver port!
Too spicy.
You're Moe?! Wait, are you human, too?
So...you made BMO?
Aw.
Yeah, all we saw was that tram jerk and all those jerky security jerks!Hazelnut! Hazelnut! What if your name was Zelnut? And then I would be all like Hey, Zelnut.
Hey, Zelnut.
You hear that?
Of course I will.
What? Naw.
We don't know that!
Whatever, look, she needs my help... and I'm gonna help her whether you're coming with me or not.
Susan, what can we do?
My magic?
No, you don't understand. I'm not a fish person. I'm human.
That was awesome. See, Jake? We can trust Susan. She's on the trolley.
What?
She's not crazy! She's cool!
Quit acting like a clam, you ham.
Balzacs!
Come on. She knows this place. Trust. We're ready when you are, Susan.
Chill out.
Alright, Susan, what do we do next?
Yeah, what are Lub Glubs, exactly?
Hmm.
Thank... you...
Whoa... Ominous.
We gotta use the fire, like Susan said. Are you okay with that?
Susan! We need you!
Yeah, Susan!
Susan!
Humans and Hyoomans got to stick together!
Huh?
It's working, Susan!  Jake.
You were right, Susan. This place is great. Well, we'd better get home.
No, I can't. I'm not like you.
Susan...What's shakin'?
What if I'm still asleep?
Aah! Dream monster!
Quick, let's go enjoy this dream before we wake up!
...  Dreamy, dream, dream...
Hmm?
Oh, well, then it's time to get real.
The monster ate somebody! We have to go inside its guts!
Hyup!
C'mon!
Dude, this isn't a party! We gotta get you outta here!
Jake, help me!
These crazy bears don't know they're in danger!
Jake, wait. We have to help them.
Okay, Jake, what happens when you eat food?
Yeah...?
Hey, excuse me! Excuse me! I don't know how you don't know this, but y'all are partyin' in a monster's stomach!
No!  Y'ALL... are PARTYIN'... in a MONSTER'S... STOMACH!
Hi, Cubby.
Why won't they listen?
Cubby, is there anything we can do to help?
Party Pat?
Can you take us to him?
Bye, Cubby!
Uhh... we're lookin' for Party Pat?
Oh, uh...  Well, listen. I know you don't know us, sir, but we need to talk.
It's pretty important, actually
You're Party Pat?
Riiiight... right.
But!
Yeah, he keeps drinking those honey-flavored energy drinks.
How's your nausea?
Hang in there, pal.  Hey, Party Pat. You're the chief, and I totes respect that... but what we have to tell you is really important. And you said if we partied, we could talk.
What?!
That's what I've been trying to tell you, man! This isn't a cavey'all are partyin' in a monster's BELLY!
So... you'll tell everyone to leave?
But you're all gonna die if you stay!
All those bears... are gonna turn into the stuff.
Yeah, good thing he isn't swallowing some deadly volcano lava. That would kill them for sure.
The monster is headed toward that volcano!
We gotta warn the bears!
If we bum everyone out, maybe they'll listen to us.
Just follow my lead.
You bears gotta get outta here or you're all gonna be melted by lava!
Party Pat, do you know of another exit?
He must be talkin' about the butt intestines! C'mon, Jake, we gotta get outta here!
One more bandage.
Huzzah! The party bears are safe, Party Pat. Y'all can party out here now.
Hmmm.
Pat, he's not gonna let you back in his mouth. You scorched it all up with fireworks! Unless... Party Pat!  Party... pancakes.
Hey, Jake.  Wait up!Wait!
Why are you holding your bass up high like that?
But you look like a nerd. Move it back down. It's better.
A-move the bass a-down.
Do you remember anything from when you were the Ice King?
Do you still have impressions from all the times we flipped your bricks?
Yeah, man.
Yeah, but...Nuts to that. I wanna find a mystery cave.
Ow!
Ooh-la-la.
Mystery cave! C'mon, Jake!  Oh, my glory...
Yeah. I want it for my sacred bathroom.
Jake!! You see this crazy jazz?!
Jake! C'mon quit messin' with me.  WHOA!
Me, too, bro.
Heh heh heh heh heh!
What? Nooo...  No! Not this song!!
Guys... I haven't liked this song since I was two.  Cut it OUT!
It's just a dumb old leaf, ya dumb old Ice King.
Wait! What?! Ice King! You can hear me?
No, it's just no one else can see me or hear me talk.
Man... Never thought I'd be happy to talk to you, Ice King. Can ya help me get free??
Anyways... Where do all these spirits come from?
Sick.
Cool.
And doing that will set me back to normal??
So be it!
I... did it.  I did it. I'm ready, Ice King. Make me normal now.
Ew! Ew! Ew!  Eeeewwww!!
So... now I can go back to normal.
...What?
What is that?
What do I do? Follow the heads?
Alright, man, I'll get it.  Where's your daddy, huh? Is he hiding in there?
You better get back in the Spirit Hole, dead one.  Okay...
Oh, my what? The cave?? How the...??? ...Weird. That's weird, but whatevs, though.  Whatevs. Ice King! Ice Kiiiing!  Where'd you go, Simon?  Ice King?  Dude, come on, what?
I'm gonna re-open the hole.
Great. Now we're both stuck in here.
STOP! WUUH!
Ah, jeez, come on!
Whoa, do that again.  Your hand is affecting the TV! We must have some kinda subtle effect on the material plane!
It's okay! But let's use our subtle influence to break the lamb!
Yeah, man! Bwoooo!  It's workin', man! Combine the swirls!
YES!!
Heh-heh.Off...
Off the dome, here we go. Uh! I'm-a start it now. I'm-a battle now. We gonna make a rhyme, so I can rap this time. I rap for millions...  sesquipedalians.
Whoo!  Huh? Rap Bear, what's wrong, man?
No way! You are the best! Going up against you was a dream come true. I look up to you, man. You're like... You're like my hero, Rap Bear.
Yeah, but Billy's dead, so... Billy.
Ha-ha! Yeah! You're awesome Billy! Ha-ha!
Sick.
Huh? Who dat?
Say what?! That's so weird. I was just  Party Pat was just like
This is Billy's ex-girlfriend.
Jake's still in denial about Billy.
Billy's loincloth!
Thank you, Canyon. I guess I've been in denial, too. Have you been back to Billy's crack?
It's time to go see Billy's crack.
He needs more time. This would mess him up too much.
Fairies! Oh, they've infested the place! Okay, you guys, out! This is Billy's crack.
I'll dib up your brains if you don't respect the mems of Billy.
Laters.
Um, so, Canyon, why did you and Billy break up?
Even heroes have slumps, bro.
What is it?
Whoa, let me see!
Hmm. Looks like he got to most of these. He sure lived a full life. Okay, here's one. Wait. Tell Finn that thing. What the butt is that?
Okay, that's gonna bother me forever. Wellwell, here's one more. We should do it for Billy.
Holy shram! Whoo!
Whoa. So... can I see you sometime?
Take Canyon on one last ride.  Whoops.  What? Another item? You sneaky Billy. Lie on my back in the ocean. Just float. Cool.  Why the ocean, Billy?!
Okay, Finn, don't think about your fear. Just jump in there like it's no biggie. Do it for Billy. For Billy!
I'm afraid. I'm afraid! Oh, dang, here he comes! Here comes the Fear Feaster!
This stank is for Billy.
Huh?  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
For Billy!
Huh? Whoa!
Was that you or me? Huh? Hey. Hey! II'm doing it!  I'm not afraid of the ocean anymore! I'm doing it, Billy.
You're welcome. Canyon helped, too.
I know. Is that the thing you wanted to tell me?
Wait. Billy!
What's the thing you wanted to tell me?
Joshua's not alive. Me and Jake buried him behind the
What?Thanks, bro!
Okay. What is it, bro?
What you do mean?
It still works.  Hyut!
I love this sword.
Mm, maybe we should try someone else.
Yeah, but we're lookin' for a sword. Remember that armor he sold us?
Oh. Doesn't look like it's open.
Need a sword.
I don't know. I've never used a grass sword before. Maybe we should keep lookin'.
Don't come around every day, uh?  I love it.
Huh? Hyut!
Yeah! Came outta nowhere! It was gonna bonk you on the head.
No more pizza bonks. Hyut!  Hey, we're near Tree Trunks' house. Let's stop by and get some pie.
Hyut! Hyut!
Hyaaaah!
Hyut!
No, man. This sword doesn't seem to have any curse on it, as far as I can tell.  Hyah!
I got it!
Whoa!
Sorry, man. I don't know what happened. I-I... I'll go put this away.
Huh?
What the?
Jeez.
Stupid...  thing!  Worst three bucks I've ever spent.
Whew.
The sword is after my flesh!
Don't let it get me, Jake!
Let's go return that junk.
Hmm. Maybe someone around here knows where he is.
Somebody in trouble!
Let's get 'em!  Hey!
Stealing candles from old ladies is immoral!
School!  Hyah!
No.
Yeah... not comin' off.
I made a mistake, CG. This merch is totally defective.  Please.
Yeah, thanks!
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop!
Hmm. For a cursed dingus, you cut so good.
Come forth, wizard, and uncurse my mitt! Grassy Mountain Wizard!
Hyah!
Lift the curse.
Hmm. You know what?  I think I'm cool with that.
Whoa.
Yeah.  This is really cool!  I just had to get used to it.Get it, get it!
Yah!
Don't you ever let me catch you here again!
Whoo-hoo! Ya ha ha ha ha!  Agh! Ow!  Ooooooow! Agh agh mee duh!
No, I got a splinter from the door.
But it hurts! I'm gonna need some...  ...finger protection! Thanks, Choose Goose.
Man, I am so protected right now!
Hey guys! Check this out! Dude, hit me!  Oww!  On my armor!
Click-click!
Choose Goose, I need more armor.
Uhh, no, Choose Goose. I need...
No, Choose Goose. I want--
Choose Goose, I want the most  Click-click armor you have!
I'll take that one!
No way! Choose Goose, this stuff is overpriced!
A poem?
Ah, yes! I'm gonna get that armor!
Ja!  He's just jealous that I'm gonna have cooler armor than him!
The sun nibbles on the clouds, and gum drop tears rain down. I don't get it...
How'd you understand that?
You're not coming?
This place will be a piece of...
Aaaaah!!! Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry!  Aaaaaaaaah!!!
Huuuh!!!
I'm not a pervert!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!  Aah!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
No!
Aahhhh! We'll see who's embarrassed when I get that armor! What does the poem say?
What does that even mean?!
Aw, man! I don't know how to silence that!
No. This is my burden.
Hey, Monster Lady! Hey! Stop crying!
Stop crying because that's what you want to do!
Huh?! Ahh!!! Ahh!!! Ahh ahh ahh!!! Ahh ahh!!!
Noo!!!
Grandfathers will not sing that to their children!
Just wait till I have the Armor of Zeldron!
Jake? You okay? Huh?
Awesome!
Finally!  Yah!
Begone, ghost! I'm here for the armor!
This game looks awful.
Dude, let's just kill him and get the armor.
Guh! Just -- just toss it on the ground.
Yeah -- guess all the embarrassment was worth it.
Huh?! Aah!!  No! Dude, this is lady armor!
No! Not Click-click! No more embarrassment!  I don't need armor!
Now what?
Never! Yaaaaaaah!
Whoa.
And I learned I don't need armor to be --
Well, at least I don't spend my day following a kid around! Get a life, dude!
Come over here and say that to my fist!
Hey, Sir Slicer, maybe you can use this!  Here you go!
Free of charge!
Ha ha!  Okay, buddy.Aw, yes. Storm has passed! Jake!  Jake...
Nachos? I love nachos...  I love nachos even more when looking out of the window!
Hmmm, does that box have a face on it? A face... I gotta make sure.
There's a box outside with a face on it! It might be the boxman, it's all soggy and dirty. Want to check it out?
I'm gonna check it out.
Hmmm, where'd your face go?
Whoa! Okay... shhh... are you lost, little cardboard dude?
Jake! There seems to be a lost cat on the ground in a box!
Hm, gettin' no help from him I guess. Do you know where your home is?
Okay, I'll follow you!
Whoa, is this your kingdom? It's wonderful!
That must be your prince.
Huh?
Huh... a prince wouldn't steal from his subjects.  Awww!
Switched?  Of course! You must be the real prince, and that thief took your place! Is that right, little prince?
Don't worry, your majesty. I'll help you reclaim your kingdom.
First, we have to expose the traitor's deception. Ah-hah! That's a counterfeit crown, from the liar's own box flesh. Hmm... it looks like your crown was torn off by some...
Your crown was lost, you say?
During a storm? The same storm that sent you hurling through the woods? Until you were delivered into my door step? Right... so it's definitely in the woods somewhere. All we have to do is find your crown to prove to your people that you're the real prince.
Um... I'm gonna wait over by the gate, your highness.
Okay, so let's retrace your steps. Do you remember which path you took? ... Prince?
Whoa, you found it already! Good work, team.
Ow, quit that!  Come on, you're a prince.  Come, your majesty. It's time...
People of the Box Kingdom, I have found...  your true prince!  J'accuse!
What? They... they don't believe us. The rain made your complexion look all hobo-like. They're not looking past the surface grunk.
Oh no, he's challenging you to a joust! I better find you a lance.
Trial by combat shall prove which prince's true!
The joust's gone nuts!
Bad! Bad princes!
Which is which...?
Awwww!  This is the one! This is your prince!
Or maybe this is the one!
Hmmm, is this... is this even a kingdom?
Haha! Hey! Ow, you guys... aw, come on!What is it?
But I've been pounding pickle juice like I was preggos. For the electrolytes.
What? Oh, I don't know. , I guess I don't feel anything. Bleh.
Who's sayin' that?
You want to go with me to Crab Princess' party tonight?
Sure. That would be fun, right?
It's cool. Guess I'll go make out with Crab Princess.
I'm lost in the darkness, what will this bring? Autumn descends on me,Autumn
I'm lost in the darkness, what will this bring?
What? Pfft!  Aah!
Yo, come on bee! Geez!
Didn't realize what? That there's a person attached to this flower?
Oh, that's cool. Thanks, beezy.
Ah, well, I came here to make out with Crab Princess, but I sort of lost steam on the walk over.  I don't know what crabs are into. I'm just gonna stop trying and let my flower wilt away. Who cares?
Whoa! Really?
Not usually, but can I have a kiss, please?
Okay. Good night, Crab Princess.
Oh, you're still here.
Pretty grease. I made out with Crab Princess, so that's grease. But really I don't feel nothing. Maybe if I made out, I will feel something? Maybe I'll reach a good vibe saturation point. And then my flower will feel good, too...
Hey, cut it out, Breezy.
Yeah, Breezy, I like you. You're a good wingman.
What's up with your head?
I ain't hung up on nobody! Nobody. Breezy, let's get out of here.
She doesn't look anything like Flame Princess, does she?
Exactly.  I'm just trying to have fun. You know, doctor's orders. But I still ain't feelin' nothing.  maybe I should just let this poor flower die.
Whoa. Bummer.
Dang. That sounds like raw deez. Breezy, you got to stay free... Free to make out with whatevs.
What?
Whoops!
Mnh-mnh.  Yo! Shut it! She's an independent lady!
Uh! Run, Breezy!
Aah!
Ow! Ooh!
Breezy... No!
Breezy?
Um... You know, I'mI'm trying to keep it casual, B. I just don't feel the same way. I don't feel anything.
I'm lost in the darkness, Breezy.
That's it. We made out.
But I'm not a good swimmer.
How's it going, guy? Is any of this helping?
I'm gonna forget you did that. Right in the vault.
Whoa, whoa, whoooooa!
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Breezy...Well, looks like your new house is done.  Whoop! Jake! You wanna check out the new house?
Great!   This doesn't hurt as bad as it used to.   Oh gob! Oh gob! Oh gob!
Haha, I'm okay!
You... wanna hug?
Bye.
Bye!
Uh... I don't know, was the hug okay? Give me some tips man.
What about Tier 15?
Dude, I got no idea what you're talking about.
What!?    Oh gross.
Do you think Flame Princess could smell me?
Crup.
I'm gonna take a shower. Princess, do not inhale!
Just don't.  Hyap!
Yyyaawn!  Whoop. Jake, I'm going to see Flame Princess, be back later.
Ah, that's okay, Princess.
Jake, Flame Princess is waiting for me. I'm gonna bounce out.
Word.
Yo, dude! So what did Princess Bubblegum want?
I got about five hugs, does that count?
Uhaah.. Well, I'm still at Tier 1.
Ee-eww! Let's see.... She's bright. She's beautiful. She makes me feel... confused, l-like something's filling up my chest, like I can't breathe, is it because she's so.. dangerous? Glob, Jake, I can't stand it!
Inspiration...
Oh, uh, hi, Princess. I'm, uhh, writing something for Jake.
Yyeah.
Yeah, I understand.
What are you trying to say?!
Grr... Bubblegum! I can't do this anymore!
Now you like me!?
What am I talking about!?  PB, I was.... geh...eh..  I was in love with you! Okay?! And you didn't love me back! Now I'm ready to move on, and it's like...rrmph!! You're gonna build me up all over again! Well, I'm done! I'm done.
Your wavelengths are my weakness, your emissions are what I've been missing.
Ohhhh-uh, Flame Princess!
FLAME PRINCESS!
Ohhh-tsst. Flame Princess!
Hey!  What's wrong? Please, say something.  Please...  I need you...  to be okay.
Are you okay?Yeah!  Yeah!
I found another bike and more computers. What do you got?
Keep it together, chubby, because I think we found enough scrap to finish building our gauntlet dock; a dock that is also a gauntlet.
Don't be lazy, Jake.
Huh?
Whoa! That one's huge!
Creepy. It's a buncha guys.
Stand back, Jake! I'm gonna melt 'em outta there! Full charge.
Hey! Can you hear me? Hello?
Hey.  This one's got some kind of pack.
Let go! Let go! Let go!
Oooh... Well, I'm Finn and he's Jake.
Nah. Adventurers don't need any help.
No! Wait!
Jake, this dock is our fun pie. We should be the ones to bake it.
Uhh...
Well... they do seem really happy to do it.
Whoa!
Come on! Let's try it out!
Yeah! Woo!
Maybe you're right.
Feels weird doing nothing.
Trouble, dude! Get your axe! I'll get my... wha?
Hey, thanks man.
I have to say, Jake. My sword is totally shiny and stinkin' sharp!
Even my shoes feel different. Not only are they clean, I feel radder, faster, more... adequate.
Don't cry, Hot Dog Princess! Jake and I will fend off these battle cubes!
Man. I'm getting tired.
Jake! They don't know how to fight.
I gotta admit... they are helping.  Oh! I think I figured out how to defeat the battle cubes!
Ok! We'll take it from here, guys!
Grab all the cubes together!
It worked!
Wake up, Hot Dog Princess. You're free.
Ugh. She smells like old hot dog water.
This is awesome! You get a promotion, fella.
My turn.
What are they doing?
Jake, hit me!
We beat Adventure Master!
We're adventure masters!
I never knew being fat and lazy was so rewarding.
Hey!
Man, that tickles.
Alright, let me try.
I'm Princess Bubblegum and I'm a dork, because I like science! I've also got a really annoying voice that Finn thinks is attractive!
Hey, business dudes!
What do you guys think?
Imagine how awesome the adventure's going to be when it's time for us to go out there.
Oh, gosh.
Huh? Jake! Did you hear that?
I heard it again.
Jake! We messed up! The businessmen have gone bat-crazy, dude!
THE BUSINESSMEN ARE THE PROBLEM, you lazy plug-hole!
Guys!
Guys, stop it!
Stop it, guys!
You're jacking up those Fuzzy Friends!
But you're making them unhappy!
I am your boss! And you guys are all fired!
Nooo! Alright, guys. Now I've gotta take you down... Finn style.
I'm kicking your care-sack, dudes!
That's it! Jake! Demoralize them!
Do it, man! I have a legit plan!
Now, eat that ice cream some more to become fatter, while also using your Stretchy Powers to grow huge!
Yeah, dude! Keep growin'! You're breaking apart their robot!
Wait, man! Wait! I wanna re-hire you guys!
Yeah, mans.
I hired them to stuff themselves in that iceberg and get outta here.
I'm gonna miss my gut too.
Aww! Aww...SLAM!
That book is above your level.
None of your business!
Heh, if you're buying.
Hey!
LSP! Who robbed you?
Jake. A crime has been committed. We must find the criminal.
And retrieve whatever it is that was stolen from Lumpy Space Princess.
Clues, clues, clues.
What's that? I can't see it.
There's something in her hand!  A key! A key to...what? Three zero three. Hmm.
Ah!  Looks like we've got our first lead!
Hmm. Find anything, Jake?
Same here. BMO.  Start marking evidence.
Hmm.
Dude, check this!  Is this blood?
Hmm. LSP's injuries were 100 percent emotional. So it has to belong to Pete Sa-something. BMO, take a sample and do a full blood analysis.  The works.  Hey, if that guy cut himself during the robbery, he might have gone somewhere to buy a mini adhesive bandage. There's a drugstore across the street!
Woah!
I'm Finn. This is my partner, Jake.
I guess not. Fair dues. C'mon, Jake.
Ma'am, can you give us a name?
Did you catch which way he was going?
Nope.  Nobody's suspicious here. Just a load of decent law-abiding folk.  What the-?! Jake! What's with all the turning into stuff today?
Let's book him, son.
Stop right there! What's under that skeezy trenchcoat ya-
Oh, guys, he's getting away!
Ugh. We lost him.
Ugh! It's too far ahead! We'll never catch it.
Sweet thinkin'.
Are you Pete Sassafras?
Cuff 'em.
Look, you can cut the act and drop the sass, Sassafras. We've got an eye-witness and your blood at the scene of the crime.
Roll the dice, you pay the price.
We deserve donuts.
Man, we didn't just crack that case, we crunched it! Crumbled it!
Call me crazy, but I was thinking maybe we should actually become detectives. Like, as a job! When we were out on the streets back there, getting those leads, busting that perp, it just felt so...I don't know...right.
Aw, dude.
Oh hey, BMO. What's going on?
Nice!
It's Pete Sassafras's blood, right?
Hmm...  Oh my mind! LSP wasn't trying to say Pete Sa-something, She was trying to say Pizza something!
Unless it was delivered.
Where's the delivery guy?!
LSP could be in danger!
Phone?
Princess! Have some Banana Guards outside of LSP's hospital room!
LSP could be in danger!
OH MY JAM!!!
LSP, what is going on? You said he stole something from you.
Hurry up, dude!
Right.
Shh. Go, go!Hey, Jake, what's wrong? You look dumpy. How come? Is it because of that metal box? Is something sad inside?
There's lots of boxes that have nothing in them, but also, you can put something in the box, and then it won't be empty. Does that make you feel better?
What's Card Wars?
How come you never talked about it before? It sounds cool!
It is, man. But I still totally wanna play it. So no more moping, okay?
What's that mean?
So what kinda stakes do we play for?
Those are good stakes.
Hey! You're ruining that pop with weird taste!
Oh, gross.
Doesn't matter. Let's just play.
You think you're gonna win? I'm gonna crush you! Party-dance-style, dweeb!
So... how do I get my land on the map?
Uh...
Oh!  Hmmm...
Hey!!
Huh?
Uh... Can my Cool Dog and Ancient Scholar defeat your Husker Knights?
Hmm. Then I floop the Pig.
What?
Hmm. No. It says I can floop the Pig. See?
And, since I'm not actually attacking, your Cerebral Bloodstorm only does damage... to your own kingdom's troops.
What do you expect if all your power units come from corn? Pigs eat corn, dude. Cornfields stink.
It's just logic!
Hmm...
Oh. Right.
Hmm.
Now my battle phase begins. I activate my Ancient Scholar... to begin studying.  And I also move my Pig to the Cave of Solitude so he can take a nap.
I'll attack on a different turn.
My Pig's in the Cave of Solitude.
Uh... wouldn't Teleport only work on your own creatures?
How? You don't have any creatures that can touch 'im!  Face it, man. I'm the cool guy.
What?! That'll destroy your kingdom too, won't it?!
Aah!! My Pig!!
Uhh...
Actually, my Ancient Scholar's been studying the Raise the Dead ability.
So, my Ancient Scholar raises the dead.  I floop the Pig.
Look! My Tower's doin' a thing!
Uh... Maybe we should take a break?
Huh?!
Oh, zing.
Sorry! I gotta use the boy-style room!   BMO! BMO!
BMO! Jake's acting banununununus!
Yeah!
What?! I only played so he wouldn't be bummed!
Okay, I'll try. But... I'm a Card Wars super Amadeus!
Grob. Better make this look good.   Alright, Jake. Prepare for my ultimo attack!
I need to get rid of my Pig so Jake can reconstitute his cornfields.   I activate the Pigto attack your Wandering Bald Man.
No way! You've underestimated me and my Pig all day!
Please lose. Please lose!
Noooo!
Whoa. Math.
My boys!
Heh. You got me.
No, no. I gotta take what's coming to me.  Hey... Not that bad! I like it!
You want a taste?
In your face, dweeb!Auh... I'm not used, uh... to running on all fours! Oahh!
I'll never admit anything to you. Hey where'd you go?
Whoa aoh oh! Umpf! Okay I admit it's, it's harder than I thought.
Whoa!
I think it's some kind of city of...
I would't become a thief lady! I'm a pretty good guy.
Oh, whoa!
Enough lady!  Hey little girl, are you okay?
Whoa! We wouldn't do that. We're heroes.
Jake!
So what's wrong?
The city?
Never.  I'll get this girl's flowers back-
I'll get Penny's flowers back, and come out of that city as pure as the driven snow. Let's go Jake!
Cool.
Stop thief!
Stop!
Stop, baby! Don't steal!
Don't steal, Mr. Turtle!
Penny! Never say that!
No! The whole thing you said. About hopelessness. 'Cause I'm gonna get your basket back from whoever took it. And then I'm going to  beat my purity into them!
We can beat these thieves while we search for Penny's flower basket!
Hey turd-le turtle! I'm gonna kick your butt! Also, have you seen this little girl's flower basket?
Come back, Crossbow Guy!
Don't worry, Penny. We'll get it right after I deal with this guy!  Stealing's wrong, doofus!
There it goes!
I will smite thee, goblin thief!
You there! It's time to step into the purification chamber, son!  Hey!
How are we supposed to get that basket back if it keeps being stolen?!
No, Jake. We can't steal. We have to stay pure!
That's a great idea, Penny!
Have you forgotten?! We three ain't thieves! We're pure! Right, Jake?  Jake?
Jake!
What are you doin', man?
I'm here for ya buddy.
Nooo!  I won't let you become a thief!
Bells. That way, I'll hear you if you try to steal again.
Woah.  You read to pass through, Penny?
Sure. C'mon, let's go, Jake!
Jake, where'd you get those boots?
Jake, you're a thief now! You won't be able to get in anymore!
It's up to me, now.
Hmm. Alright, wish me luck!
Oh, yeah. Right.  Great, now I gotta climb down?!  Huh?  The King of Thieves!  Sorry to trespass, I just... Uh, hello?  The chest! In it's in his chest! Thanks!
I got it, guys!
Huh?
What?!  Is you basket under all that gold?
But you're just a cute little girl!
Well, if this isn't yours, I'm gonna return it right now!  Huh?  Why can't I...?
No!  No!!! What have I done?! What have I become?!
My hands. They're all dirty. Covered in the dust of a criminal act! I'm a thief!
Don't touch me! I'm impure, man! Unfit to be a hero! Unfit to be your friend.
No, Jake. This is a one-way path, down a jacked-up road. And I gotta walk it... alone.
Then we shall embrace the darkness of this wicked city and use the methods of the criminal to seek vengeance on Penny.
Cowabunga, indeed.
It's me, Penny. The hero whose purity you stole! And I'm here to enact my revenge upon you!
I trusted you, Penny. You made me steal. And you took my purity. You ruined me!
Thanks, dude.
She's purified!
You're welcome.
We're clean!
This good deed we did has purified us once again. We're virgin islands!
And you know what that means, Penny. No more stealing!
Well, I think it's time for us to get the math out of here.
I'll miss you, too.
Penny!What's for B-fast, Jake?
Jake! Come on! Get ready!
Look at their little faces! Haha!
Get the camera, Jake!
Great shot, BMO!
It's perfectly fine.
Naaaaawww...
Man, you're letting your brain dial turn your fear volume up. You'll see. Those Cuties are nothing but an afternoon's delight.
Jake? What're you doing in my bed?
Wait a second... Are you still messed up about those little guys?
Look, man, whaddaya say tomorrow morning we go track those little guys down and find out just what their deal is? Sound good, buddy?
Yeah. Good ol' Mom.
Yeah. Goodnight, brudda.
Wha? Huh?
Uh...
I heard.  Okay. Who's out there?
Alright. That's it.
I'm gonna go man-handle those guys's banandles!
Well, they broke a window, but I don't see any of 'em.  I guess they left.
Jake, what is it?!
Get 'im, Jake!
Jake, I got 'im! He's freakin' out, man! What do I do?!
What?!
Okay.  Rrrrrrr!  They stopped.
How do you even know our mom?
What?! Why?!
Oh, gross.
I... I don't know what to believe anymore.
Wait. Jake, look.
These guys are a threat to themselves.
Oh, hey, it's what's-his-face!
What?! No, man, look. These guys aren't gonna quit until they win or die, ...and they're not gonna win, so what if we let 'em win, just this once?
No. We'd be winning by helping them to win. That's a win!  And then they'll be happy and leave us alone.
Yessss! Now, let's rally an army so we can look intimidating.
All of our friends.
My army of friends! Today, we will lose this battle, but we will also win it!  When the enemy charges, crumble like a cookie. When you feel their puny punches, fade like a flower, and writhe in your own blood!
With faith, m'lady... and ketchup!
And hey, guys... Let's keep the acting subtle. Less is more.
Get ready, y'all. Together, we fall!
Oh, no!  My blooood!
Jake. Look.
Cute King, wait up.
We did it to protect you from yourselves.
But strength isn't your strength. Adorable cuteness is!
Um... yeah, sure! Just be righteous about it.Hmm...
I found this crystal on our door step, it's pretty mysterious, I'm trying to find information about it using the holobook.
Wait man, doesn't this look like Tree Trunks' lipstick?
Yeah, I remember.
Ha!
Uh, yeah!
Yeah-yo!
Noooooo!
Got you, dude!
No way!
I... was just... messing with... you
Yeah,  I'm just going to rest my muscles.
'Sup, dude?
Ha, you didn't mash my potatoes!  You didn't even make me cry silently into my pillow last night for- thirty minutes. In fact, you read to go again tough stuff?!
What?!
You look like a wuss!
Hey, the crystal is glowing a different color!
Chip-chap-chop, what's going on?!
It depends on who's asking, are ya'll good or evil?
Oh, I'm Finn
Jake!
Hey!
I don't know, but I'm trapped in this crystal ball, get me out of here!
Jake, you can stop these guys now!
get me out of here!
Help! My arm!
JAKE, HELP!
Don't make fun of him, he's having problems, everybody has-
JAKE! AHH! HELP!!
MY BODY!!
I'm not dead, I'm just all crystal stiff.
It sounds like-
Oh my grosh, you're alive!
Tree Trunks, you've gone bananas with crystal power!
Jake, you totally gotta stop her!
Go, Jake, go!
Jake, kick Tree Trunks in the tummy, shes probably still got that crystal gem inside her!
Tree Trunks, you're okay!
I'm okay toooo!
Okay, okay, let's go.
Ooooh!!A cheetah! A fart!
BMO, your ideas are boring.
Sparkles on the house? LET'S SQUISH 'EM!
No. They're around this holo-message player. It's got a cartridge with it.
Yeah! Okay!
WHAT?!?!
Whoa, what the--?!
Geez-louise!
What?? What was that about?
Whoo!
Wait, Jake!
Didn't you say you were hungry for burgers this morning?
And I said I was hungry for hotdogs?
I don't think those burgers and hotdogs are burgers and hotdogs at all.
DUDE!!  Look!
Man... again?
I'm gonna go walk around!
Over here!  Check it out, Jake. I found two ways. This way has some kinda flower trap, and that way... has that guy.
Mmm.
Cheer up, man. We're only tellin' you you're gross because we're your bros.
Yeah! Bros are real with each other, and you're gross, brother. Take a bath.
Hahaha, no probs.  Hey, what did Dad say?
What?! Why's Dad sayin' all that jive??
Dude... you're pickin' on me, too?
I don't even cry much. I only cry when it's healthy, like when people die.
Pff, blech... If I didn't cry when people died, I'd have a cold butt for a heart.
Maybe I will partake of the fruit.
Why not? All the people that I care about in this world are being wads.
Whoa.
I'm gonna hang here. With these fruit babes. They'll be my best buds now.
But I'm tough! My whole body is a callus!
Hmmph.
Dad's sword!
Ugh... I  I can't, man. I suck. I'm a whiny baby, and I'm fat, and all those things Dad said about me!
Yeah. I know.
Yeah! I'm stoked to slay some evil with it.
Man... Dad was cool.Whaddup camera phone!
Whoa, wait a minute Marceline. Last time I saw your dad,  I sliced open his soul sack.
Okay, but I'm keepin' an eye out for your old man in case he pulls any  sneak attacks.
Stay away from me, old man!
Okay!
Jake, grab the amulet!
Hey man, there's another video!
That amulet's controlling Marceline! We have to go back and help her!  We're gonna get back using that one portal spell we know!  Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum!
Oh yeah. Oh!  Jake! Can you turn into a gross demon?
Grosser!
Paper plate mask, yo!
Let's go!
I think we can charge up there and rip the amulet off her neck.
Yeah, okay, okay!
Ahh! Don't kill us Marceline!
Your friends, remember?
Run!  Marceline...
What are you doing?
It's Marceline! That's her out there!
No! We have to save 'er!
From the amulet!
But that's not what she wants!
Maybe we can get these dudes to help us!
Wait, that's it! We're gonna freestyle a political rap to get these guys to rise out of their systemized demon apathy.
Marceline!
Jake! The tree house!
Jake! Take her!
Marceline...  No one...  leaves the Nightosphere!I'm here just in time!
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa......
Mhm.
Thanks!
Okay.
Sure, man. Yeah. Sure, sometime.
Well, maybe one night.
Hey, y'all! Don't fight!
Sucks!
I guess I could. I just don't wanna deal with those guys right now.
Ah, okay, okay, don't hurt me!
Hmm....
Hot job! BMO, how do I look?
No!  It's me! It's Finn!  This is my alter-ego.... Davey Johnson!
I'll dress up like this so no one bothers me about being Finn.
I dunno!
Hello! Ahem, hello, hello, helloo...... ahhhhhHHH   Hello! I'm Davey!
Man, today was awesome. Just normal, y'know? Just like a normal day. No drama, or any of that. Just super normal. Man it was great.
I'm Davey.
I do love being Davey, but being Davey caused Jake to get arrested.
Yeah, that was nice.
Yeah, that was great, too. But-
Yeah.... Blend in. Y'know, maybe I'll be Davey just one more time!
No, it's me,  Finn!
Goodbye, Davey.
Good luck catching those guys!
Word.Of course, Princess!
Youre in good hands, Princess Plant.
And then the monster got punched in the head and the princess was safe. And everyone was happy!
Time to lay down beautiful buddy.
Ahhh. We killed it, man!
Okay.  All we gotta do, is go to the Land of the Dead and reclaim the flowers soul from death before Bubblegum returns.
Oh, what?! Oh, uh... yeah.
Really?
Thanks Peppermint Butler.
Uh... Oh look, an escalator!
Hey, dude.
That must be the main entrance or some biz!
Holy schmow!
Uh...
Awh dingle!
Yes!
Where do we go now, dude?

Come again?
We gotta go!  Coast is clear!
Wait, Jake! Do you hear somethin? Come on!
More skeletons! Weve gotta be really, really quiet!

Now we just gotta cross that river!

Dude!
Yes!
No! I still have to rescue stuff!
Oh wait, wait, wait! Before I die, Im honor-bound to tell you: Peppermint Butler says Hi.
Yeah!
Sure!I can't go dentist, Jake. You gotta take care of it.
Ahhhhhhhhhh.
NOOOOOO!
Nooooo! I'm too strong for the world!  I don't want to go dentist, Jake. The put you in a hole filled with snakes and rotten butter and they leave you there.
Okay.
This isn't so bad...  My sword! Wonder wh
Soft sand.  Ant.
So... dentist is ants?
I don't have any money.
Holes.  Hmm.
My tooth hurts.
My tooth hurts.
Worms.
Worms.
Me.
Heh heh.
Tiffany?!
That guy wants to kill me!
Hm. Do you have anything less sugary?
Doin' it for my tooth.
Hey, uh, partner. Um. So how are you doing, Tiffany?
Oh. Did you already know what dentist is?
The hey?
Tiffany, look. We gotta work together, right? Why don't we let bygones be bygones?
Do you want my peach?
What the stork, man? This is my special sword. Why didn't you take one of those ant swords they offered you back there?
No.
Hey, Tiffany... you know, we're really not so different, you and I.
Well, we're both friends with Jake, and that's something, right?
I didn't steal him. We're broth
Yeah, I get it.
Man, that nut's gonna try and stick me while I'm not even looking.  Don't even stress it, Finn. You're Finn Mertens, man. You got this.  Man, I hope so.
The junction.
Wall worms! Holy cow!
Dang it, Tiffany, not yet! We got to work together to beat the worms! Here they come!
Tiffany!
My tooth hurts.
Dang! It's the head worm, and she's livid! I say we get the heck out of heeeeere!
Tiffany, quick! Pull me up! Quick, Tiffany! I'm slipping!
Dang it, Tiffany! Weren't you paying attention? We're two peas in a pod! We're not oil and water. We're oil and vinegar! It's good, man. It's yummy!
It's good for you!
Sorry. I didn't hear what you said. I was just gonna let it slide.
Tiffany?  Tiffa  nooooooooo!
Huh?
Ah.  What happened down there? Where's Tiffany?
Tiffany...
Huh huh. Ayyyy!
Holy cow.
Thanks, you guys! Man, you'll never believe it. Dentist is actually
It was crazy! Tiffany was there
Wait. You all knew? What the heck? Why didn't you tellSafety!  Patrol!
C'mon. Let's keep lookin' for hazards. Look out!
Shushers, man!  Look there!
Yeah...  Suspiciously ordinary. Oh! Little house people! Maybe it is just regular ordinary, not sinister ordinaryoh, no, wait... Grass ogre.
It's an obnoxious grass ogre.
Hey, ogre! Stop hazing these cute little houses!
Sorry. I was just tryina' get your attention.
NEVER!!
You're doin' it wrong!
First, you roll your right shoulder forward...
Yeah, but then I counter it by doin' this!
Um... You need to take a break?
Nah. Just takin' five. Donny's pretty good.
Thanks, man.
Aww...
Nah. He's just rough-and-tumble, like me, but deep down, he's probably really sensitive, like me.
Hey, Donny!
I was thinkin' that since you're a pretty good wrestler, maybe you'd wanna hang out with a couple a' rascals like me and Jake!
If you come to the Tree Fort, we got video games and apple juice!
Donny's problem is that he's treated like an outsider, like me.
I... am complicated.
Hey, Donny, you should play Bug Battle.
Okay. There's you, and here come the bugs.
Oh, yeah. Those guys'll get ya.
Have more apple juice. It always makes me feel better when I  Aaah! Donny! Quit being a jerk!
You have to think about how your actions make other people feel.
Okay, yeah!  Empathy, empathy, put yourself in the place of me!  Your turn!
...Um... kinda right.  Someone needs our help! Jake, you stay here and try to fix him, while I deal with an unknown possibly deadly emergency!
Hands off the housing market!  BACKPACK!  Werewolves. Much worse than ogres.
Is there somewhere I can trap that thing?
Perfect!  Slam-bam-in-a-can! Huh? Another werewolf?!? What's up with this town?!
Mr. Bank! Are you alright?!
Why is this town just getting worse and worse?
Hey! What are you werewolves up to?!
Uh... Why-wolves?
What?!
Oh, no! I have to get Donny back!
Donny, you have to go right now, and stop the Why-wolves from
What's it goin'?!
Oh, no... Oh, no. Oh, no, nonononononono! No! This is all wrong! We need jerk Donny to make the obnoxygen, and, and
Are you wearing jeans now?!
But, but, but
What did you do?!
No! We messed up, Jake! The House People are doomed if Donny doesn't go back to being town jerk!
But the housies will be wiped out if you don't!
Donny, you gotta go!
Now, go be a jerk to those Why-wolves!
Man! The town is getting creamed! By not being a jerk, you're being a real jerk, Donny!!
He sure is sensitive about his songs!   It's cuz they think your songs are dumb!
They all think you're a real jerk!
You did it, Donny! You're a full-blown jerk again!
I'm sorry, Donny.
I'd... I'd like that. Very much.Haha, let's see...  First we visit Tree Trunks for apple pie, and then we go to Bubblegum's science music thing!
That's after we make dream sandwiches!
Whoo!
Tree Trunks!
Tree Trunks!
Cool.
Where's the apple pie, Tree Trunks?
WHOA! You love 'er?!
You just said you love 'er.
Dude, you should just tell her how you feel!
You givin' me a back rub, bro?
Hyeah! Break it up, break it up! Okay, the love show is over! Princess, please continue.
Y'all are too affectionate. It makes people feel... bothered when you and the Pig your affection in public!
You two need to hide your love... or else, you'll end up making the whole world throw up!
Thank you.
I think I saw it in the closet!
Nice stacks of sandwiches!
I'm makin' a cheese sandwich!  Tree Trunks! Pig! Come on!
Doesn't look like Tree Trunks and Pig are around!
Just try to ignore it and watch the movie!
Tree Trunks, this has gone on long enough! No more spending time with the Pig, unless you do it, inside your own home.
Then, why don't you two just get married?
Then I guess we only have one option.
Alright.
Sorry, Tree Trunks.
Why don't you make apple pie to take your mind off of it?
Go to him.
You know what? I like it. It's nice.You got it, Princess.
There. That's the last sign, Jake. Now no one will go down this hole, ever. Probably a lot of dangerous, awesome stuff down this hole. I better go take a look.
Whoa.
The crystal eye. I wanna meet this dungeon.
Eh, I'll skip lunch. Just catch up with me when you are finished.
What?
Hey! I can do things without you! You wanna bet I can't?
We are betting! I bet that I'll get that crystal eye and be back within 11 minutes.  Ready set go!
Dungeons! Chambers! Woah.  Evil creatures!  Treasure chests!
Doorways!  Traps!  I'm in my elemeeeeeeeeent!!
Aww!
Oh?
Whoa! Somebody come pick up your freaky cat.
How did you almost know my name?!
Huh, yeah right. That sounds like idiot talk!
You can't hurt me! I'm a radical boy on a mission for the crystal eye!
Unzip this!
Bleep!  OOF!
Yeah, right! Good excuse! Slaps, that cat was kicking my buns! And it might have finished my buns if it weren't for Jake's stank. Dang it, Jake! I'll get that crystal eye on my own! With my own odors.  Hmm, no to skeletal remains door.  No to giant monster mouth door.  Oh! Giant key door it is!
If Jake was here, he could stretch his hand into a key and open it.  Yeah! Key hand!  Ouch!  Hey! What the jug is that?
Oh, sweet, the key!
Ew, jelly cube?!  Come on! Give it to me! Don't flaunt it if you're not gonna give it up!  I'll never get that crystal eye! No. No, I just gotta stay pumped.  Pump it up, pump it up! Whoo! Whoo! Shake it! Shake it! Ahh!  Steady, Finn. This place is probably more creeped out of you than you are of it.
Okay, then I won't fight you.
Hey cutie, do you know how to get to the crystal eye from here?
Thanks!
Yes, I can. Because I'm huge compared to you.
Aw, buckets.
Heh, thing is... I don't really... have any powers.
AAAAH!! Dang it, Jake wouldn't be running! He'd grow all big, and sock you right in the nose hole!  Aw, nutzoids!  Come on! All aboard the knuckle train to fist planet!
Oww... I rode the knuckle train? But... I... I'm in my element.
AHHHHH!!!! Ow! OW! Ow! OW! Ow! Uhh! That... sucked.  Alright, Finn, you're in a heavy pickle here. You don't have Jake, and you're on your own. But you can still handle this. You can still get that crystal eye!
You mean Jake?
Crud, crud, crud, crud, crud!
Oh, Jake... I'm such a fool. A silly, silly fool.  Who the heck--?!
Re...really?
Okay.  This is radical.
I'm fine, thank you.
Ha ha!
Aww, yeah!
Wow... Wait! What??!
Put me down, lady!
Man, everybody wants to eat me up. It's probably 'cause I'm so sweet.
That's Jake's secret, too. I sure hope he saves me.
Lady, you are sick! Oh, Jake...
Jake!
Where were you?!
Yeah... I think I do.
Now let's find a way out of this cage.
I really don't see any key holes on this cage.
I'll get us out of here, with carrot hand!
Wait! You'd help me win a bet that I made that I said I could accomplish something without you?
Cling!
Okay.
If I die, I'll have died with my best friend!
Uhh... I learned that you're a very... intelligent princess?What... is the meaning of soup?
What... is the meaning of spoon?
Naw, that's all fine. I just been feeling kind of... gray, is all. Like my inside voice has been kinda quiet lately. Not a lot of instructions forthcoming, y'know?
Yeah, I-I guess. Or maybe dating girls is like riding a bicycle.
Or, like, if you mess up, you could get really hurt forever, or hurt someone you really care about.
Relax, buddy. We'll just cross after it passes. No big thing, really.
Ow!
Yeeow!
Knock it off!
Whoa!
Dang, look at that sword!  Whoa. Feels kinda right.  Whoosh. Whoosh. Vvsh, vvsh.   Whoa!
Yeah, man! It's spicy baby fun!
Yes!
Whoa, Crystal Ants, I think!
Ha-ha! Yeah!  Die, die, die, die, die, die, die!
Man, look at all this rad loot!
Whoa, what do you mean? We just started only, like, three hours ago.
Oh, come on.  It's fun! Just one more car. Come on.  Come on, man!  Come on!
Ha-ha, yes!
Hmm? Where is everybody?
Whoa, man! Boss battle! Let's chew it up!
We'll see!
Ha-ha!
Eh, weird cave, weird trainI'm cool here.
Hyah!
Oh? Oh, dang. Boss loot!  Oh, yeah.
Jake, hurry. Next car!
Slime crimes!
Hey.
Ow!  Ow. Cool... acid!
Yeah, man. I guess we've been here for a while.
Yeah, I guess I could take a snack break.
Look.  Now we don't gotta do that thing you wanted to do.
Hot meat!
Ant no thang!  Yah!  Caught with your ants down! Ants for nothin'!  Forget about ant!  What's wrong? Feeling antsy?
Same car,  but those were blue ants. These are red ants.
Man, no way. All this feels good.  Like my inside voice is saying, Hey, keep it up. This is good stuff.  Aah! Hey!  Ah! Like when you made those biscuits way back? And I kept eating them until they were all gone. Like that!
Yeah!
Boss fight!
Check it out: battle moon.
Whoa. I'm gonna have the best life!
Oh, Hair Apes!
What? No, man! It's better on the train; stuff makes sense here.
Yow!
You'll be back.
Hey!   Hair we go!
Hey, hey! Jake, it's me!  I'm just all souped up now.
Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl.
What? Those guys are cool!
Jake, stay back. I mean it!
Yoink!   Pff, Jaketryin' to tell me what to do. Pff, yeah, right. I tells me what to do. Now let's see what we got here.  Apple, apple, chicken, apple...  Oh, yeah, that little orb in which I rule! Let's see that again, orb.  Yeah, that's right. Lookin' right.  Wait a second, who's that sad ward little guy followin' me around?  Jake? All those yearshe stayed with me.
Oh, Jake. Hang in there, buddy. I'ma set this right.
No, I'm sorry, Jake. I messed up, but don't worry. It's all over now.
Well... you are. I'm gonna keep playin' for a while. I'll meet you back home in a week or two.
No, no for real!  My inside is tellin' me it's time. Here,  see for yourself.Ech.   Why are you stinkin' up our house?
Right.
Mmhm.
Flame Princess isn't crazy.
No.
She said she wanted time to herself.
Fighting snow-a-constrictors really helped take my mind off things.
So, uh, why am I here again?
Oh, this is terrible! If Flame Princess goes back there, her evil dad will lock her up again!
We gotta save her. Let's doogie!
Listen, we need to get into the castle right now.
Grrr! So I can go to your mama's house! Now get outta my way!
Honest my fist!  Come on, Princess!
Man.
Alright, so you wanna get nasty? One time, I blew a snot bubble that broke off and floated away. Then it hit some lady's baby in the face, and it started crying.
Flame Princess?
You're okay! Um, how's it going?
Oh.
Wow. She's even awesomer than I remember.
Flame Princess, listen. I'm really sorry I lied and hurt your feelings, and I was a big fat jerk
So, does that mean we're still going out?
I see.
Anything.
Heh. Okay. I promise.
Hmm.Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Look, Jake.  More guardians. The Citadel, I presume.
Hey. Do you think maybe one of them could be my dad?
Right, right that makes sense.
Hey! The Lich again! This must be where the prison cells be at. See? Good riddance to you. I hope you rot forever, you awful jerk clapper! Some people just make the world a worse place to be in just by being around, Jake.  That's right. Bad apples. Lock 'em all up, I say. At the bottom of the ocean where it's too dark to see 'em.
Daddy!  Aah!  All locked up in there. D-Do you think maybe he's a criminal too?
Jeez, man! Now I wish I hadn't said all that stuff before. Now my heart feels yellow and green.  Maybe we shouldn't even have come herewaah!?  Jake, what did you do?
He's melting the crystal all up!  Breaking cats out left and right. Turning cats gray. Did he trick us again? I think he did.
Oh. We... we don't have a Star Skipper.
Hey, um... I... I wanted to ask you something. I... well...  Hey, wait up!   Dad, wait!  Dad, I need to ask you - aah!
What? No.  Listen, you don't gotta worry about a thing, Jake ol' pal.  We just need to defeat those five space villains, hijack the shard they're hijacking and sail it home to safety.  Easy peasy.
Aahh! Uh oh!
Nooch?
Dad...
Okay, M-Martin. We need to talk.
Why'd you abandon me in the forest when I was a little baby???
It's time to peel bananas on this fool, as a family!  How about it, Martin?  Mmmm!  Wha?
Oh, you don't like this stuff, huh?  Whoa!  Right in the doorbell.  Dad.  Jake, finish off the Lich. I gotta go catch my dad.
Dad, wait!
Dad! Stop!
Martin! I won't let you escape!
I mean, at least you finished off the Lich, right?Jake! Hey, I got a for-real important question: do you like cereal in your cake? Jake?  Hmm...  Mm-mm-mm.
BMO, resume.
Uh, Jake? What's going on, man? Feeling okay?No way!
Ah, jeez! Jake, is this stuff you're saying true? Or are you just trying to mess me up? You have to be honest.
Reliable? Rats!
This tree?!
Jake?
You're full of it, Jake!
Errr...  NO WORMS ON THE BED!
Huh?
AAAAAH!!!
Jake! Jake! I saw someone outside the window! It must be the vampire, and I think we're unprepared, so I--
But you said you heard it from a reliable source!
No one's outside.
It was just the wind, scaredy-cat.
You're a total wuss, man.
Are you gonna smash my skull and breathe my blood mist?!
Sooo, you don't suck blood?
Like what?
OOO!
Nuts?
You're wonderful.
What?
She can't kick us out of our house!
Get down here, lady, and fight me!
I'm gonna kill her.
But, what about our home?
But I like our home.
Really?
You always know what to say.
Okay. I'm convinced. Let's roll!
This is weak! I don't even like any of these places. I wanna go home.
I don't wanna hear a lecture, dude! I just wanna go home...
Yeah, I guess I'd rather be out here, wrapped in your ear, than be in some awesome house all by my... souse.
Shut up, dude!
And abandoned.
Whoa, bro... Wanna just live in here?
Yeah, we did... So, ah, what should we do first with our new digs?
Ah this is it, feelin' good, I'm feelin', I'm feelin' like we did it. I'm feelin', like, completely satisfied. Nothin' else could go wrong, ya know, Jake?
Aww, yeah, I know, too.
What do you want, Marceline?!
What!?
Y-You can't take our home twice!
AAAAAAAHHHH! It's vampire-fighting time!
But she's taking our home again!
Oh, yeah. Okay, Marceline, I'm gonna let you keep this cave, but only because Jake is my home, and he's way better than all your homes combined!
What!?
Let go of Jake!
You okay, pal?
I'm not scared of you!
You're pathetic!  Get ready for an uppercut, you dog!
Jake!
Why didn't you just kill me?
Aren't you dead?
Soooo so does that mean we can have our old house back?
Huh? Did you guys get on the bed? I told you, you're not allowed!He's heading for that cube. Come on, Jake.
Whaaaat?!?! He's gone!
Do you know where he went? We have to find our friend.
Uh. Oh.
Wish?
WHAT?!?! OH GLOB!
Whoa! Wait, Jake. Don't mess this up. Think about it: if we wish everything back to normal, the Lich could just jazz it up again.
Hmmmm.
I got it! I wish... the Lich... never... even ever existed!Uh...
Uh, it's good! It's good! It's really good, dude! It was amazing!Messed.
Yeah, Ill try it. Could always stand to feel better.
Check it!
You sure you read that spell right?
Wanna keep stickin our thumbs in stuff til it works?
Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I!
Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I!
Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I!
Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-a Do you feel like a good boy?
Hey check out that gross toad!
We stuck or thumbs in almost every hole today.
Controllers?  Haha! Oh yeah! Super Good Boys!Okay, BMO,  be back in an hour. You sure you don't need anything from the Grocery Kingdom?
Bye, BMO!
See, man? I told you.
No, man. That's my toothbrush.
Prove that BMO does weird junk when nobody is around. Check!
That was pretty weak.
You wanna give it another go?
That was better... but we can do better.
Let's back on up and run at each other!
I like the pain.
Ready!?
Jake!
I know how we can do the most ultimate high-five ever!!
You ready to do this, dude!?
SUPER-ULTIMATE HIGH-FIVE GO!!!
Awesome...Hmm. Why would I need to learn about caterpillar families? I don't get it.
Real leaves aren't made out of candy. They always have a gross, bitter taste.
Ugh. That's gross, too. There's no way real caterpillars are delicious.
No way I'm eating a bug's butt. Those kids are right. Whats the big deez about the food chain, anyway? Lets hit the snack bar and eat something yummy.
Hey, this is pretty fun!
I'm hungies.
Oh, dude, you ate those?!
Uh, how did I get so mad chubs? I only ate one grub.
What?!
Help me, Jake! My body's too bloated to fly!
There goes my din-din. Why am I hungry again?
Jake!
It's me, Finn.
Jake, we are good friends. So let me just say you look awesome right now.
Yeah.
You're looking tasty.  Hey, why don't you take a seat in my mouth?
It's okay. It's okay. Just give it a try. It's a new experience, right?
No...? But if I did that'd be okay, right?
I'm just following the Law of Nature.
I don't know. I just feel that way.
Aw, Jake, you're missing out... by not getting eaten... by me.
So alone. So hungry.  The Law of Nature... has claimed this... bod...
Yay! What a big turnout. Top notch! To decompose stuff! Yeah-h-h! We are so pumped! Yeah!  What's that smell?
Wow. It looks amazing! Yay! Yay!
Party time!
So good! Awesome. This bird went bad so well!
Come on, think of it as a conversation starterlike, The other night, I ate the grossest thing I've ever tasted. You know, it's interesting.
Whew! I'm full.
Whoa! Aah!
Whoa! Aah! Whoa! Aah! What's going on?! Whoa!
I think we're safe now... and also caterpillars.
I'm hungry.
She's beautiful.
Hold on, Erin. Food! Water! Shade! Where are you?!
Yummy!
So good, dude.
Your eyes.
Uh,  d-d-do you want to get married?
Y-y-y-yes.
This way, Erin!
When we're reborn as caterpillars, I'll marry you all over again!
My eyes are open.Walking, walking, walking  hambone break!
Geez Louise, guy
I got this little piece of sugar.  Nuts, I'm freaking all about sugar. But I am even more about feeding hobos!
Why?
A hero always helps someone in need and besides he's probably a secret elf who will reward us for being nice. Here you go, buddy.
Aw, yeah!
what is wrong with you, Magic Man?!
why did you do that!?
No! Change me back.
What the heck, man?? What kind of deal is that? I help somebody out and they make me a stinky foot.
Get off of me, man! I can't be a hero if I'm a big good-smelling foot!
Why are you being so level-headed about this?
You're the SISS, siss! Augh!
No, dude! I wanna go find that magic man and get my body back!
This sucks, dude.
No, Jake. Let's find that Magic Man.
But I-I can't even bend these big fat toes, man.
Not to scorn the kicking of people in the crotch?
Aaahh!
Uhh. Okay, you can do this, Finn.  Start small, man. I'm taking you down!
It's hot! Oh, man, I'm smoking hot! Please, help me out! I can't move!
No, I didn't start any
Unh!  I'm not a freak, I'm a hero.
Jake, how'd you find me?
I'm not going to cry, man! I just feel like crying. We have to find that magic guy and  get my body back now!
Jake!
Get back here!
Yeah! You know that guy?
What?! No, dude. These guys might be my only hope of finding the Magic Man.
Thanks for being cool and all, but what do you know about this Magic Man? How do we catch him?
But don't y'all even want to try?
Why not? You're all totally miserable here.
No, it's not, Zap! It's not a living! It's dookie diapers! I don't want to be a foot!
Jake, stop screwing around.  You're gonna make me give into depression.
I...  Maybe I will do nothing.] Maybe I'll just lay down here.  Maybe I'll just lay down here.  Maybe I'll just lay down here.  Maybe I'll just lay down here. [Grunts and struggles to get to the floor] Lay down uh [falls to the ground]and rot like the rest of you.
Is this really my life?
Get up, Gork!
I'm not gonna let you lie here,
And I'm not gonna be cool!
Ja-a-a-ke, stop tellin' me to enjoy, bein' a foot, and get out of that trash!
Get up!
All of you make me sick!
Huh?
Wait a second. Kim, get underneath Trudy.
Kim, I will destroy you!
Yes! Now for me  Look at us!
Word! Now let's go wreck up that Magic Man!
You're darn right we are!
Give us our bodies back!
Oh. You were trying to teach us to be kind without expecting anything return. I should've given you that sugar cube without even thinking about a reward.
Ah, geez!
You've gifted us nothing but heartache, Magic Man! What is the life lesson in that?!
Answer this!
I wish I'd never been nice to you 'cause you're just a big jerk!
Man, I frickin' hate that guy. But at least now we can all go back to our regular lives.
Oh, okay. Bye, guys. See you, later.  Wait, so, what was the lesson we just learned?
Speaking of jerks, what the blubbins, man?! Why wouldn't you help me turn back into a boy?!
What?
You could be a foot right now. I saw you change into a foot twice yesterday.Hurry, Lady!
It's happening again.
Princess!
Oh, sweet!
Princess!!
Nooo!!!
Princess!
Alright, we'll each make our own version of the formula. One of us is bound to get it right.
Hmm?
Done.
Bubblegum, I'm comin' for you!!!
Mine first.
Cram!
Stairs!
Jake, try yours and Lady's next!
LSP, look out!
Dang it, Jake. We only got one formula left. Try yours and Lady's.
Wh-... where now?!
Did anyone get bit?
Jake! Did it get 'cha?
Okay, let's see here...
Ha! Yeah, okay.  Yes! This book has a glossary of symbols.
Jake, I think this little guy has serious dance fever.
I am! Okay, Jake's probably going turn into a zombie, but that's okay. I just have to figure out this formula.
Hang on, Lady! I'll have the antidote soon, but whatever you do, just don't let him out. He may look like the Jake that once loved you, but he's just a zombie!
Hey, Lady...
The book!
Sorry, everybody. Sorry, LSP, PB, Jake, LR, peepee poopoo doodoo.  You know, it's funny; I don't even know your name.
Yeah? What is it, girl?  Sci... ence. Your name is Science? Could it be?
Hmm...
Here goes nothing.
Jake!
Don't worry, Science. I've got a disgusting idea.  OH, MY GLOB!!!
Yes.Huh. Is this, like, eating for you?
Hmm.
Huh?
Whoa.
Huh? What's cookin'? Smells good.
My body is engulfed in flames!  Oh, so good!
Jake! Jake! I had an awesome dream! Flame Princess was there; My body was on fire. I think it was inspired by Flame Princess battling Ice King yesterday!
Man, I need to have that dream again. I have to get Flame Princess to beat down Ice King again.
Why does anyone do anything?
Mmm?
Suit yourself!
Hey, look!  Hey, look! There's that big jerk you hate so much, remember?
Oh, dang. Did you hear that?! I think he's, like, making fun of you.
Yeah, it's in the tone of his voice.
Put it away, man! You didn't win nothing!
Are you okay? You feel... lukewarm.
Yeah. Sleep.
Milk.  Milk.  Play the sleep jam, BMO.
Mmm. What's cookin'? Smells good. Wha?!  What?! Oh, no!
Jake! I had another dream. My body was being blasted. But this time, Ice King was blasting me with ice cubes! Aww. It was awful! And someone else was there. He was just laughing and laughing. He was in the first dream too, but he was whispering. I couldn't make out what he was saying. Oh, yeah!  It was the Cosmic Owl!
I couldn't see him last time!
Dear Ice King, you smell like stink, you're unpleasant, you're not funny, you're old, blah blah blah, sincerely, the Flame Princess. P.S., let us fight.  Dear Flame Princess, you're just the worst, your hair is bad, your feet smell like face cheeks, blah blah blah, let's meet up and fight, dummy, sincerely, Ice King.  Flame Princess fight Ice King.
Ice King!
Flame Princess!
I maybe went too far with this jazz.  Flame Princess! Oh, too hot.
Oh!  Huh?  Uh...
Huh?
Okay, I can fix this. I can make it right.
Ice King!
I'm so sorry, man.
Oh.  C'mon. Let's get out of here.
Huh?
No, princess. I'm the one who's sorry.  Ice King hasn't been picking fights with you, it's...it's been me all along.
Yes, but look, it's just like, I had this dream and it was because of that fight you had. It was weird, but I also liked it. But it was important because the Cosmic Owl was  So I had to get you to beat up Ice King-
Princess!
But, I said I was sorry.Yo, BMO, what happened?
Who would have thought we could have too much treasure?
No punishment, dude. Just chill where you are.
So what should we do with all this swash?
Hey, maybe we could, like, spend it?
Dude, like all of it. Then we can find completely new treasure.
Check it out, Jake.
Nice place. So how are we gonna spend all this gish?
Ha!
Yeah, this'll be easy.  Ho, ho, young berry lads!
Go buy the most expensive meats and furniture to adorn our new fountain home. Keep the change for your families in need. Hyup!
Really?
Dude, we bought all this furniture and meat, and we still have a ton of gamboni left.
Yeah, man. Whoo!
Oh, no, we're not robbers. We're actually here to give you money.
Guys, I'm super sorry about my friend. Here.
Don't eat it, ya dums!
Dude, I do not approve of the way you're spending money right now.
What?
Don't worry, brother. I'll help you see the error of your ways.
Berry lads! Berry lads! I need to spend all this blingo fast.
Take me to the seediest alley in the kingdom.
Friendly Crudberries, I have money for you! Come get it!

Hey, take it easy, breh.
I-I-I don't want any trouble.  I'm trying to help you.
Whew!
Dude!
Jake, this money is bad. We got to get rid of all of it right now.
Huh? Gold piece. You want to flip to see who writes that apology letter?
No way, man.What's wrong, dude?
Is that from getting chubby?
Oop! My bad.
This old copy of Adventure Boy magazinethe only magazine for boy adventurers. This kid Rusty is getting chased down the river by three grown otters. This magazine rules! But I'm saving the end for tomorrow.

Ghost fly, what's your problem?!

That's cool.
Hmm?
The end of my story. And it's so close.
I know. It's an obvi trap. But wait. What if... watch this. Ha!  Mm?
If I extend the circle...  farther... I can get closer to the magazine.
Just have to stay inside this circle.
Ha ha! How'd you do it, Rusty? How'd you shake them otters?   Man, what a great ending!
Jake, I missed you, bro!
Don't ever leave me again!Just about done.
How much Softy Cheesy for ya deezy? A little? A lot?
But you used to love Softy Cheese!
What was that?
Dude. It's just Ghost Princess. Hey, GP.   She's weird, huh?  How's it goin'?
Well, could ya knock it off??
It's a crime case!
That's right. We don't even know how she was moida'd, but I'm the hard-boiled sleuth who's gonna crack your case wiiiide open!
Our first clue!  Female. It's a good start, but we need more. Jake, it's time to interrogate the neighbors. We'll do it good cop bad cop style. I CALL BAD COP!
Yo, ghost! Yo, yo! Yo, wake up, fool! Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

Oh. That's... that's cool.
Yugh!
A'ight.   Man... I wanted to crack the case, y'know?
Jake! You looted?! That's bad, man! You're supposed to be good cop.
Come on, let's put all this stuff back.
Yes, Jake.  Huh. This dagger says, Rence.
I guess some donkus's real name was...  ReeeeEEEENCE?!!
Is this your knife, bro?
...We gotta dig up the princess.
Look!  Sorry.  Lookit!  Cla-rence. Clarence was some donkus!
Clarence is your murdler!
So that's why you don't like Softy Cheese!
Haha, yeah!
You sure you're ready for this, man?

...And right.
I'm proud of you, pal. Real proud.I don't know. Who are you bringin'?
Oh.
I'll take this duck!
Man, I don't want to be smooched!
Lame.  Ah! Well, I'll take this blanket!
Yeah, yeah.
I'm going to call a girl I don't have to kiss.
Hi Princess! Would you go to Couples Movie Night with me?
No! I was just wondering if you wanted to go with me.
But
She doesn't want to go!
What?
Hehe. Are you gonna help us?
Um... hmm funny... funny... giddy up?
Hehe. Um... diggy diggy?
Diggy diggy!  Diggy diggy!
I, um... uh... it's... something.
But Jake said Phase 2 is powerful!
Yeah...
Haha, you said fun so much, it sounds all weird now. Fun. F
Oh, Oh! I like to wrestle! And fight!  But girls don't like that.
Ffffffuuunnn. Ffffuuunn.
What is that stuff?
Well... I was going to give Marceline's plan a try, too.
Oh... this is my... Lute... suit.
Oh.  This is my lute-suit!
Oh, yeah!  So... Headlock!
Uh... I guess the suit did feel... a little silly.
I'm sorry!
Naw, he just needs some spaghetti.
Really?
Like metaphorically?
Uhh...  Mhmm.
This was a really good idea.
Haha, okay.
Yeah, I know! I put them there! Pretty exciting, right? Heh heh.
I don't understand, Marceline. I tried everything. I guess she just doesn't like me.
Marceline! Of course! It's been Marceline all along!
Ah, no, thanks, man. But I really need your help!
Marceline! Will you go to the movies with me!
Good evening my dear, your escort is here!
With you, I would walk down any road, m'lady. Especially if it leads to the movies.
How do you like your popcorn?
Well then let's do something fun! Like go to the movies!
Headlock!
Date me? I just wanna go to the movies. But everybody hates me.
Huh? No! Movies!
'Cause Jake said Couples Night had weird kissing requirements and romance initiation rituals and whatever else.
You will?
Of course as friends!
YeaWha?
Oh, man! I can't believe I'm finally going to see this movie!
Couples Night sucks! Marceline, would you do me the honor, of getting the plop out of here?Our pleas', T.T.!
Mm, not sure.
Mm.
Fat squirrel in trub! Gah!  Oh, no!
Hmm...
Alright, welp, see you later, Sweet P!Um, it's just a little stick fort.
I like it when you get small, Jake.
Whoa, Peppermint Butler!
Hi, Goliad. I'm Finn.
Hi, Goliad.
What did you use to make her?
What? Let us teach her.
C'mon, Goliad.
See ya later, Princess! Get some sleep!
Look, Goliad. This is a preschool. I'm gonna set up some obstacles and all that for you to learn on, is that okay?
Okay, great. Jake, you go and get some kids from inside to help with the lesson and such.
Oh, hey, y'all are just in time. You ready to pop this croc's back Dr. Goliad?
Oh, no, it's cool. I got helmets for everybody.
Okay, Goliad, you ready to lead?
Okay, in 3, 2, 1...  Go!
Stop stop! No, Goliad, no! Leading isn't about scaring people, you gotta stay calm and use your head. Use that beautiful brain, girlfriend.
Yeah! Don't be shy. Try it on me, lead me.
No, Goliad, that's wrong, too.
You can't just control people or whatever, it's messed up.
Um, no, no. ...Wait, is that true?
Princess! Princess!
She got the wrong idea about leadership!
Don't worry, Princess. We'll stop her!
Goliad, no!
Jake, don't swallow!
Uhh, you're in Finn's bubble.
Don't think of the plan... Think of something else. Think of something else.
Don't worry, Princess. We'll stop her!
Yeah, that dude saved me.
Wha-- What are they doing now?
They're so evenly matched that it's a stalemate!
Well, that's pretty cool, but... I don't understand. If Goliad and Stormo are the same, how come Stormo is a good guy?
Oh, whoa so, that means Stormo is like... my son?
Happy birthday, Stormo.Jake's ball landed over here, BMO!
Heh heh heh heh heh heh!
'Sup, LSP?
Wha?
WANTEDADVENTURE SECRETARY.  Smells like fruit pie.
Dude, look at 'er.
Yeah, it's sad. Come on. We've gotta help 'er.
Oh. Uh...  We got some blueberries.
Oh, cool. Old spaghetti. I'm gonna go heat this up.
Have a good night. See ya in the mornin'.
We're carrying these rocks on an adventure, up to the Mystery Mountains.
That's okay. Jake can carry 'em.
C'mon, LSP. You can make it.
Hey, LSP, shake a leg.
The Loch of Phantoms. Princess Bubblegum said the rocks would show us the safe path.
Haha! Jake! Ker-ploop.
Alright!
We can meetcha back at the tree house later if you want.  That weird light...
Huh? Listen, LSP, we've gotta be carefu
No, LSP! It's not safe!
She's stuck in there!
Oh. Uh, Bubblegum sent us on a quest to destroy these cursed mirrors. Evil stuff happens when you look into them.
LSP... you don't need a mirror to know you look good.  You're beautiful on the inside. Like... your brain and stuff!
Uh... Bye, LSP.
Oh. Yeah! Yeah, I have.
Oh. Okay.
Wow. Uh, thanks!Haha! Time to protect the sun!
Firepit number 1. Easy-peasy, livin' greasy! You wonder why they even put it there.
Haha! Please.  Bleep!
I had my eyes closed on that one!
I ain't in it for the money, man. I'm in it to crush the enemies of the sun. Like this sloppy butt right here.
I'm like, Hunny Bunny, don't you ever learn? I've always got the bomba!
Oh, I very can!
Okay! Here goes.
Aww! Every time!  BMO, this game is the worst! If we were really inside that game, man, we would crush Sleepy Sam. Breezily! With my mitts!
Whoa, whoa, wait!
Oh, man. Oh, BMO! You gotta let us in that game!
Oh. Okay, BMO. Well, time for bed!
Time for bed. Right, Jake?
We're in the game!
I'm looking at my bits! My leg is math!
No wonder all the monsters in this game want to get their grubby mitts on it! Let's go kick their digital bootays!  Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo doo! Doo!
We are in the computer world. We're computer boys, not computer girls.
I can walk and sing, I can kill Silly Sam!
Pit!  Looks a mite bigger inside the game...
Jake!!
Whaa?! Jake, what the shake?
You still have two left!
Jake!
Dude! What if losing all your lives in here makes you die in real life? Or worse?!
No way, man! We're gonna cross that hole! With real-world grit! Come on!
Faster, Jake! Get ready to stretch it!
Watch out, Jake!
We're pretty intense dudes!
Ha!
Sounds like...
Hi-yah!  Oh!
You ready to flippin' this guy up, Jake?
Yo, what up?
Yeah. I got extra lives, man!
Whoa!
Time to use the bomba!  Come to me, bomba.  Bomba!  Oh, bomba! I can't select you without my controller!
Man, we've never run away from Hunny Bunny!
Firepit, Bouncy Bee, Hunny Bunny. They're supposed to be the easy parts! They're all hard as butts! Sleepy Sam is gonna be the ultimate butt-kicker!
Man, get a hold of your brains! We need to stay alert for Sleepy Sam!
Get down!  What's he doing? He's probably trying to psych me out!  I'm gonna break you, Sam. When I'm done, they'll call you...uh, Stinky Sam. Stupid Frog.
M-m-my mitts didn't- didn't work! Come on, help me punch him!
I can see the light! We're almost there!
Oh no, man. It's the edge of the screen! We're trapped and they'll be here any second.
We can't get the bomba!
Jake? Jake!
That's not how it works!
Jake, let go of that!
Oh, holy cow! That was nuts, man!
No, no, no! Don't kill us, man! No!
You mean, that's it? You're not gonna kill us?
...what?
BMO, quick! Hit your button!
The combo move? That never works!
Okay, okay. You got this, Finn! For your friends!  Up! Down! Left! Left! Right! Right! Down! Spin! Down! Up! Left! Right! Left! Down! Spin! Up! Down! Jump!!
Whoa.
Oh, crud!
I'm sorry, buddy!
I know, I know. I was double butt. For real.  Man! Now that we know what to expect, next time will be way more fun!
How 'bout it, BMO? You in?
Hey! Don't do the combo move on us!
BMO! Stop messing around!Jake! Jake!  Jake?  Hmmm...
I don't know how to play.
Huh? Let's go!
Soft People! Why are you all in a tizzy?
The Gut Grinder?
Uhhh... it came back and ate all your gold?
Aw, don't cry, Soft Old Man. I'll find this monster and bring peace to this village. I swear!
I swear to justice!
Okay, so, what does he look like?
Whoa, no, no-no-no-no! Calm down, everybody. This is my friend, Jake the Dog.
That guy wee-wees weird.
Pfft.
I didn't say anything.  People of the village of Soft People, I, Finn, and my buddy Jake, will find this monstrous monster and slay it!
Come on, let's go, Jake.
Dude, your paws'll fit anything.
I'm Jake the Dog and I put my nose in poop.
Huh?
Hey Cube People, what's going on here?
Whoa, no, no, no! He's not the Gut Grinder! He's my friend!
Jake, back to your normal size.
We are also seeking the Gut Grinder. Me and my friend Jake will find it and slay it! Tell us what he looked like.
Huh... Which way did he go?
Jake! Hey, come on!
Thanks, guys!
What?!
You can't be stealing gold in your sleep--I watch you while you sleep.
I can't help it. I take pictures.
Justice never sleeps.
You... are... not... the... Gut... Grinder!
Let's go! Oh, wait--what if these guys think you're the Gut Grinder? Hmm...  Ah-ha!  Got the perfect thing for ya:  Groucho glasses!
Woohoo! Yeah!
Oh, man! These people are a mess!
I am Finn the hero!
We're on a mission to catch the Gut Grinder.
I hereby vow to catch that thief and bring your gold back!
Oh, thanks.
Well, duh, it looks like you.  We already knew that. It's just one of those weird coincidences--like how my belly button looks like your face.
Jake, stop it!
No, no-no-no-no! He's not the Gut Grinder! I swear on my good name... and justice... and Jake's cute face!
NOOOOOO!
I'll get you out of here... somehow.
Buddy, listen to me. You've been my best friend for as long as I can remember! That's enough evidence to prove to me that you're not a monster!
Huh? Wait, I got an idea!
Hey, Gut Grinder! I got some gold here that you missed. Come and get it!
Huh. Whoa, you're the Gut Grinder?
Woohoo! Yeah! We got him! Thanks for saving me, Jake!
What? Jake?  Whoa!
Whoa!
If I give you this stupid tooth, will you stop being a crazy jerk?!
What the--? Jake! You never turn into a monster when I want you to. It's always, Not now, Finn. I have a headache. Oh, Jake,  your viola is all I have now.
Jake, you remember your viola!
Who else would it be, baby?
You were so crazy, man! Like--like, actually crazy.
It's good to have you back.
Man, if I had known you were so easily manipulated, I would have eaten more of your ice cream.
No problem, mayor.
No, don't do that! Don't hug us!  Don't touch me! AAAAAAAAAH!Man, I still can't believe Marceline is 1,000 years old and has never seen Heat Signature. This movie is gonna blow their minds.
Marceline! We brought Heat Signature.
Whatup?
Hmm. Yeah, that's pretty sweet. Hope y'all like getting your minds blown, cause it's showtime.
What is wrong with this couch?
Aww, what? man, no fair.
Wait! Hold on just a second.
Marceline, we insist you turn us into vampires. Or ghosts, or whatever. We just wanna fly.
Okay, Marceline, we're ready now.
Pretty... much... the same.
I felt it. Jake, do you feel it?
Oh no. Jake. Now we're gonna have to drink blood for all eternity.
Ugh. Come on.
Whooooa... Marceline, can we float now?
With all my heart.
You're invisible!
Let's mess with her.
She knows it's us.
Let's disguise them.  We're invisible!
Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, Jake!
But we're undead.
Thanks.
You know we are.
Ow! What's the point of this lesson?
Ow! It hurts!
We're okay.  It's all worth it.
Cool.
Heh heh. No way.
Did you see us?
Holy snaps, that's awesome!
We're not gonna go.
Nah. I'm kinda tired from doing vampire stuff all day. We're just gonna chill.
Well, we're going back home.
Number 25, Blood Drive.  Hey guys, we're here! Wow! Look at you guys! That's awesome!
Uh...  Georgy, what's wrong? Jake, what's happening?
Oh, sweet. VAMPIRE KICK!
Pssh. Then why am I flying, Wendy?  Oh.  Yo, man. I think Marceline tricked us.
It's okay. You're here now to beat up those ghosts and save us.
Aw, man.  I can't believe we're gonna die just because we wanted to be comfortable watching Heat Signature.
This stink-ups mega bam-bam to the J-stop. Could we just go back to the brain-eating or whatever?
Well, can't we just--Hahahaha! Here I go!
Whoo-hoo!!
Awesome!  Someone needs our help!
Dude! It's Marceline the Vampire Queen!
You still petrified of vampires?
Hey! Cut that out!
Stop making this poor old dude cry!
Stop it!
Oh, no. Don't worry, sir. I'll see to it you get set free.
I'll do what I need to. I'll even take his place!
Uh... well...  Heck yeah!
I couldn't watch that old man suffer, Jake. My code of honor wouldn't allow it.
I can't. As a hero, I'm bound by my  WOOOOORD!!
Feed?! What does she mean? L-Like, like, oats? Like, sentient beings, or oats?! It doesn't matter! I can handle it!
No way, Marceline! I'm not gonna open this door if innocent people will be hurt!
I...  Yes...
Sorry about this.
No!
I'm sorry, sir. I'm bound by my code of honor to do what she says.
Wait, wait! I'm not married to
No!  No!
NOOOOO!!!
Huh?
I... I thought you were
B-but...
Oh... Yeah... Okay...
Man... What's wrong with this girl? I can't tell if she's messin' with me, or... or what.
Huh? No!
Uhh, NEVER!  Okay! I'll do it!
Haha, aw, yeah, that sounds bombastic, honey! Hey, I'm gonna run up ahead and scout it out for you, sugar!
My boss is gonna sack your castle!
No!  Listen! You hear that?! My master is marching here with her army of the undead!
Listen to me!!  EVERYBODY!! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!
Don't do this, Marceline! I beg you!
Wha?!
Okay... So, she makes things seem bad, a-and then... or-or her personality makes them seem bad, or...  I'm over-reacting.
Huh?
Alright! Whoo-hoo! Hahahaha!
Hey, Marceline!
Uh, yeah, sure. Why?
Whoa-ho-ho! That's cool!
Hahaha! A dimple!
What is it?
What?!
I'm gonna murder you. I'm not entirely sure why. I'm sure this will end happy...  AAH! I don't get it! There's always a twist to the stuff Marceline makes me do, but where's the twist in bumping off this bush?!
But wh
I-I thought  Sick!!
Hmm...
Hey. Can't the sun, like, destroy you?
Uh... Jake told me I came out of a cabbage.
Yeah, sure. That sounds good.
I'm not fallin' for your junk anymore, lady! You just like sayin' poop that jacks with my brain!
I knew it! Hey... what about your old henchman? Who was that guy?
Yeah, man! I mean, wo-man.
Jake?
Marceline!
She's alright, man!
I can't let you do that, Jake!
Jake, listen! Marceline is not how she seems! She's a radical dame who likes to play games!
Oh, man!
I-I'm free! Jake! You faced your fear and saved me!
Yup!
That's what henchmen are for.
We're still on for pixie-strangling tomorrow, though, right?I'm pretty full, man... but lemme see if I can... rearrange.  Nope. Can't do it.
Sometimes it helps.
Ahh...
Lady Rainicorn again?
Um... maybe give her parents some treasure?
What's it say?
Sweet! Let's go powder our noses!
Why's Lady so nervous, anyway?
There were wars between rainicorns and dogs?
Dude! Her parents are probably all full of dog-hatred from the war-times! They're gonna see you're a dog and forbid Lady from ever hanging out with you again!
You didn't think this through enough... IT COULD HAPPEN!!
Don't worry. I've got a plan that's gonna solve this biz. Homies help homies. Always.
Haha, yeah! This plan is perfect!
Come ooonnn. Trust me, homie.
Haha! The plan is working, homie!
I'm Jake's rainicorn roommate! Everyone do the traditional rainicorn rain dance!
But
Ha! You got it, homie!
Snacks! Get your snacks!
Hmm... I got a plan, bro-ham. Just stretch your horn at me, and I'll take care of the rest.
Homies help homies.
IT'S GOING CRUD-COW!
Being poked in the buns and laughed at was not in my plan! Not in the plan!
...Okay.
WAAAH! Jake!! I think they wanna eat me!!
JAKE! COME ON!
AAAH! Knock it off, Bob!!
What did she say?
J.J. FLIP! What the zip?!
Wow! That's flippin' awesome.
...Wha?
Oh.
Oh.Last chance, Swamp Giant! Tell us where you hid the Mini Queen!
Huh?  Hi, Mini Queen! Jake! I've got 'er!
My inflatable angel.
I dunno. Can't understand a word she says.  Aww! My pleasure, ma'am! I just like beating up evil!  Okay... Didn't... catch any of that either.
What?
Billy?!
Oh, yeah! That was the most mathematical thing ever!
This is so cool!
It's Billy's legendary crack!
It's him! It's him!!
Man! I'm such a huge nerd for you! Please take us on as hero apprentices!
So that we could learn to kick evil's butt... just like you!
What do you mean, pointless? We just saved the Mini Queen from a monster!
Nonviolently??  I gotta try being nonviolent... the Billy way...
Billy, I won't let you down!
This is gonna be tough, Jake. I'll have to suppress my every warrior instinct.
Oh, uh...
Dude. We gotta do something to help him.
Hey, Mister. Besides being chased by a monster, what else is wrong?
I still feel weird about not fighting off that dragon.
Free gruel, ma'am. I can't beat monster butts, but I can beat your hungry guts. That's for sure!
YEAH!!!
This is great, Jake!
Whoa! Look who it is!
Huh?  Oh, that's probably the stone skin potion I added to the recipe. It gives your body the power to grow armor.
Geez... I thought people would like that.
So you can defend against evil monsters!
No, see? I'm helping you nonviolently!
Sooo... the village needs the help of a new cobbler, eh?
Alright! We're cobblers!
I think it has something to do with shoes...
Of course I'll help!
There!  Whah!  Pa-kow!!
Now you can fight off evil if it shows up at the funeral!
Maybe...  Whoa!
Apparently, I suck at being nonviolent.
Totes. I'll stop pooping my diaper.
Medical help? Hmmmmm...
How can we help?
Yikes...
I've got three left!
We transformed you into a cyborg fighter! That's hot, right?
...Jake...?
I think us being nonviolent... is hurting people. Man... Billy is gonna be so bummed out...
I just wanna sit here and moan.
Thaaaanks, buuuddy...
Huh?? A fist raised in righteous anger?! Oh, no! It's my fist!! I've gotta think of a way to save this old lady without punchin' this guy in the face!! Hmmm...
WRONG!!!!   I couldn't think of anything...
POOP!! I saved her with violence...
The greatest hero in the world told me to help people without being violent... and I promised I would do that and not let him down... but I did let 'im down.
Yeah... Yeah...! YEAH!! That old lady has a point!
It's all so clear to me! Back to the cave of Billy!!
It's us again.
Billy, an old lady told me that I shouldn't listen to you because you're old. Also, that I should do what I was born to do... which is kickin' buns.
We saved 'er, Billy.
I saved 'er, Billy. I saved 'er using violence. And that's not a bad thing, Billy! This old lady is alive because of these!  And look how happy she is, man! She's elated!Ice King?! How many times have we warned you about using love potion?
Yeah, you stink so much I'm gonna ground you for a week!
You're grounded for two weeks!
Three weeks.
Four weeks?
That just grounded you for four weeks.
Get outta here, bubble-butt!
Mine's whack.
Huh. What kind of meat is that?
Do you think it hurts Meat Man when he gives us his meat?
What do you think grounded means?!
Oh, great. Now see what you did to my buddy? So help me, Ice King.
It's alright, buddy. We can make another.
Punch, punch, punch!
I'm trying.
Oh, yeah?
You're grounded!
Oh, my life!
Jake, do something. He's getting close!
What do we do?
Yeah, we don't trust you!Jake... you made this?
And you buried the treasure right here?
Jake! You're awesome!  So cool...
A suitcase?! Oh, man!
Whoa. Wait a second, man. I know this case.
One night, while you were away at Lady's house, I was dancing in the woods...
Perchance I saw the Ice King doing something suspicious, so I trailed 'im to the dump, where he buried this case in the ground.
I waited for him to leave... but he played in those boogers for hours. I decided to come back later for the case... but I lost track of it.
Mm-hmm.
Jake! Jake, come on!
Okay. You can play this , right, BMO?
Oh.
I think it's the Ice King's diary.
No, man, we might miss something.
There's gotta be some evil secrets in here. I wanna keep watching.
Thanks, Gunther.
There's probably some evil secrets coming up.  Someone wants to see the secret tapes!
Right!
Oh! You're right.  More quietly!
Okay. If we're quiet long enough, Ice King will think no one's home and go away.
Just turn your alarm off!
No, just hit your snooze button!
Well, then, tell me how to do it!
He must know we're watching his tapes. We need to find his secrets faster.
Fast-forward, BMO.
Play, BMO.
No! These tapes are important! We just don't know why yet. BMO, fast-forward to triple speed!
BMO, play normal speed.
Telling evil secrets in secret code... He's brilliant!
BMO, you're brilliant!
Um... The smartest person we know, Princess Bubblegum!  She's brilliant...
Hey, Princess Bubblegum.
Jake and I found a bunch of secret tapes! We were wondering if you'd help us decode them.
What?
Hey, Princess. We got disconnected.
So... how's the weather in Candy Kingdom?
The only thing that smells like penguins is you, Ice King!!
What're you doing?!
No, man!
He doesn't know that we're watching his tapes. We gotta find these evil secrets before he uses them against us!Huh. I guess you do know all the words. Anyway, start the next video, BMO. We gotta crack the code on the Ice King's evil secret tapes!
Brrrr... You guys cold?
Really?
Whoa...
Oh, my Glob, Jake... Is this it? Could this be the Ice King's evil secret?   WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!
No, man! I know you've got evil secrets on these, and we're gonna find 'em!
Crip, Jake! We gotta unravel these evil secrets at warp-crazy!
Weird...  He's sneakin' in through the chimney!
Play it! His evil secret must be on that tape!!
Wait, Ice King.  BMO, eject tape, please.  Here, Ice King.
No... It's... well... These belong to you.
How about once a year?; Who was that?
Dude, I think I have a crush.
What do you know about her, Jake?
You shut your dirty mouth!
Naw, man, I peeped beyond her burning gaze, and noshed hot lunch with her soul.  She ain't evil. She's passionate. Help me track her down.
C'mon, man, I really like her. Help me out.  Jake, Jake help me out. Help me out. Jake, Jake, help me. Jake, Jake, help me!
Whoo! Alright!
Is that bird... smoking?
Oh, Jake... look at her. She's innocent. Like the steam off a puppy's nose, searching for ham in the snow.
Yeah, she is like a cute little flower.
Oh, no, are you ok?
I... I was just worried about you.
Look, I'm sorry about what I said before. I don't know what happened, but I just, I had to see you again. And, I don't know.. I don't know anything about you,  but I just, I really like you. You know, you're so... beautiful.
Whoa!
Oh, Glob. Am I hurting you?
I'm not followi-- Well, I guess technically I am following you.
Hey, no wait!
I guess now I'm technically chasing you.
Where are you? I want to chat it up with you! Oh, we lost her!
Whoa.
Hey, I like your fireballs.
I'm not trying to. I just like you. I think I... I think I like-like you. Listen, when I look at you, my brain goes all stupid. And I just wanna hug you, and sit on the couch and play BMO with you. I can't explain why, but, I never felt this way before and I think we should be together.
Yeah.
Wait wait, I really didn't--
No!
I can't fight her, man. I'm still into her!
Rrrrhh.. Being a hero.
Uh-uh-uh, I gotta' get back to her.
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh...
And we missed you, too, but Neptr, right now we need you to--
Neptr, will you help us build fire-proof suits?
I sure hope Flame Princess is okay.
Jake, you think Flame Princess is okay?
We're coming up on the Goblin Kingdom.
There she is.
She seems okay.
Flame Princess!
Listen, you gotta stop burning the Goblin Kingdom, ...but I don't wanna fight you or hurt you, I swear.
Aah! Jake didn't mean that!
No, Jake, stop. You're hurting her!
Wha?
No, Neptr!
NOOOO!
I'm sorry!
My bad, Jake! Turn it off, Neptr!
NO!
No more... No more!  FLAME PRINCESS!
I can't fight her, ...but I can't let her destroy the city... I've failed everyone.
No. Why can't I just like a girl?
Wah! Did I... do something... cool while I was knocked out?
What?
What, cry? No, I j--
N-No. I-I don't usually do that.
No! N-N-N-NO-NO-NO!
No, we don't have to. I can take it... I... I mean, can't we try?
Uh... yeah, whatevs.
Aaah.. Uh.
WHAAAAT!?!
She hugged me... then left.
It hurt.The Tree of Blight.
Every hundred years, it spews evil spores across the land.
What the?! Is this an extra butt?!  Quick, Jake! Burn the tree!
No!  Jake, hurry!
No, he's just... hugging me gently!
Didn't even tell me its name...
Oh, sweet! Ha-ha-ha!
I just feel affectionate, I guess. Hugging helps.
I feel hot.
Yeah. I feel like a million clams.
What's the matter, Cinnamon Bun?
Uh... I didn't hug you last night.
CB says I hugged 'im. Haha. Cinnamon Bun, you got some crazy notions. I tell ya.  Oh, Cinnamon Bun.   What a crazy story, buddy.
Wait. You don't think I actually snuck into Cinnamon Bun's room and hugged him, do you?
But no. Why would I? And don't tell me it's because I have repressed emotional feelings for Cinnamon Bun.
...So...?
Like last night!
Well, how can I get uncursed?
Uh... I'm scared, Jake...
I'm sorry!  I feel hot! Rrrrr!!
I think so.
Yeah. I heard you. I said I think so.
Oh. Okay. IS THIS GOOD?!?
Prickly and painful.
Cool. So, can I hug the cactus now?
But that poor cactus! It... it... NEEDS ME!
I want to hug you, Jake! Close!
I'LL HUG YOUR MOM!
Hrrugs!! HUGS FOR BUDDIES!
Bring it in, guys!
Not cool!
Hug wolf, away!
Hug you up, bro!
HUUUUGS!!
Huh? Huh?  What... What happened? Jake... what happened to me last night?
NO!
People of the Candy Kingdom, all I've ever wanted was to keep you all safe, ...and because I can't undo the hugs I've caused, my sole wish is to be locked up forever in the Candy Dungeon.
Huh?  HUUUGS!!
Cinnamon Bun... let me out...
Don't you want a hug?
Not even a little one?
You want a hug?
You call that a hug?
Uuuugghhh... Huh?  You... You stopped hugging me.
I just... didn't feel like I needed any more hugs.
JAKE!!!!!Well, well, well. Looks like the Ice King is up to bad biscuits, brotha.
Ice King, you make our job too easy. You ready to roll on this fool?
...Wha?
Nice job, Marceline.
You don't want us to...  ...for you?
...Okay... Well... I guess we'll see ya, then...
...I have no idea.That was awesome! Alright, alright, my turn.
Gross!   No!  Princess? You, okay?
Uh, we can go get 'em.
Flambo, we need you to cast Flame Shield on us.
These candles, must be They.
Hey! Don't disrespect my lady!
A conspirator with a hiss voice!
And a conspirator with an untied shoe.
Did you hear that?
Jake, come on! We gotta stop those guys from killing Flame Princess's dad!
Dirt bags! Where'd they go?
You hear that? It sounds like a voice with a hiss.
Stop!
We must follow the voice
Which way is the hiss voice coming from?
Which way?
Jake!
Whooooo!   Why didn't you catch me?
Jake, I wanna see.
No hissing.
Whoa, it's him!
I heard your hiss voice!
What?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
What's going with the costumes?
That's brilliant!
Hey conspirator!
Let's talk about how we're gonna kill the king.
Maybe, let's keep goin'. So, what are you packin'?
I thinks he's starting to crack. Water? You know what is more painful, if we pour ice in his ear. That's how we'll kill the Flame King.
What!? No!
Please, we were trying to warn you about the assassins!
Ahh... ahh, ah.
Sssstill?
Untied shoelace?  It's them!
NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES!
NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES!
NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES!  We found 'em! The executioners are the real king killers!
Wait! So, you? You extinguished their dad?
And everyone is evil here?
Then, is Flame Princess: evil or maybe chaotic neutral?
Okay, so your daughter's evil. We've established that, but do you think if a good guy really liked her, could he, change her to good?
Aww...Yeah, man!
Whaaaat?
Hey, Princess Bubblegum. Hey, everybody.
Yeah... I'm havin' some sweat issues here! I'll go get us some snackety-juice.
Check it out, Jake! I got us some peanuts. And punch!
Choking!! Don't give up on me, man!
Yeah. 'S pretty cool. It's the Enchiridionthe hero's handbook.  Hey, guy, you alright?  Haha. He's all good! Everybody get back to your dancin'!
Whoa. Haha. I think you're right. Hey, bear, you gonna come hang out with us?  Whaddaya say, bear?  Heh-heh. Awesome.
Yeah. He's totally weird. Hahaha!
Jake! Hey, Jake!  Jake!
Come here! Ya gotta check this out!
Check this out, man. This bear is tops blooby!  Watch this.  Ya gotta try this, Jake. He does everything I do!
Haha, come on, Jake, try it!
He's got me down pat! Heh-hah! Sweeping's weak.
Whoa! This guy's alright!
Hey, come on, he's just a bear. He don't know nothin'.
Yeah, I guess you're right, Jake. It is pretty late. He should probably stay here tonight.   You can sleep in the bathtub!
Brathtub, hahaha! This guy's tops blooby!
What are you doing?!
That sounds rad, man.
...I do believe you.
It's just, y'know, who cares? Dancing, wearing clothes... He ain't hurtin' nobody. He's just doin' it up, y'know? He's just cool, and he likes my style. That ain't a crime.
Okay. Great. I'm going back to bed. You comin', smart guy?
Anyway, I gotta go pick up BMO from soccer. I'll be back soon. And remember: don't eat my special Finn cakes. Finn only.
OH, MY GLOB, WHAT?!?! JAKE! YOU ATE ALL MY FINN CAKES! WHAT THE STINK!
The bear ate all my cakes, and you just sat there and watched him do it?! What's wrong with you?!
He's a bear, Jake! He's a wild animal! He doesn't know things! He just does stuff! He's cool!
...Wait. What? What party?
Finn'z... bezt... party? But... I didn't make this flyer.
What the what?
She's not my...  We never went steady.
Not cool, man.  You're not me. You're just a bear acting like me.   It's okay, everyone. The imposter is gone.
Wait... what?
Hey! Hey, bear!
Hey. I... I didn't mean to make you feel so bad about yourself. I'm really sorry about that.
But... you're a super-rad bear, so... why not just be you?
Awww...
Hold on, bear. I got something for ya. It's the Enchiridion, the hero's handbook. Everything you need to know about being a hero is in this book. Take it, and learn.
Whatever, man. We never use it, except for, like, sitting on it when the grass is wet and stuff.  Drink your fill of knowledge. Someday, you'll be a great hero.Owwww-guh...
Huh? Oh.
Gold-darn you, tear ducts! Yah! Yah!
BMO, go away!
Who lit that fire?! I'll kill you!
Yaaah!
Bubblegum's rockets!  Don't you touch her stuff!!!
It's a girl.
I like you!
Who was that?
Dude, I think I have a crush.A truer friend, there was none.
Hey... We can put it back in the fridge, if you want.
Whoof! What was that?
Hyup!
Aughhh!  Whoo! Crazy dream, man. Prismo was definitely in it, butJake?
You up already?
What the...
Jake, why are you pretending to dig up Everything Burrito?
Hold on, I'm coming down.
Jake, you gotta hear my dream, IJake?
What the jump?
Jake, are you sleepwalking?
Wake!  Up!  Tunk... I'm not dreaming!
Jake! I saw you explode. Something messed up is haps, bruh.
No, man, you blew into chunks over there!
Jake, this already happened. C'mon, man, stop freakin' me out
Ugh, Jake dust!
Dude, what is the deal?
Okay, seems like all of Jake's remanifesting themselves,  but as soon as I break their history it creates a paradox and Jake explodes.
What?
in your dreams?
All this striz happened when Jake and I tried to preserve Prismo's pickles in our dreams, something must have changed when we went to sleep!
So, ugh, I just got to hope that Jake tries to do the pickle ritual again. So I can re-enact it with him. Exactly the way it happened, maybe?! Geez!
Whoof! What was that?
Hyup!
Whoa! The pickle jar! I'm coming Jake!
Whoa...Where the heck am I?
Jake!? I'm coming man!
Jake! Don't explode!
Prismo! I saw you die, dude!
So, are you actually talking to me right now or are you pretending to in an empty room?
What does 'now' meant to you?
So where're we going?
I'll see what, Prismo?
Whaaaat?
Yeah, is that gonna kill you again though?
Uh, yes. Although I gotta say that this is as rickety as yoga balls.
You tell you about it!
Well, anyway, here I go.  Hey, Jake, wake up.
We gotta bounce.
Cool  this way!
Stop my who?
'He', me or other me?
Shut it Prismo, heroes risk everything for their friends. Although I admit you're more Jake's friend than mine. Sometimes you can think someone is totally cool, but you never become besties. Now I don't know why that happens, but regardless let's do this.
PLAN B!
This is me? This sword is me?
Welcome back, Prismo.No problem, Marceline.
I would never dream of it... m'lady.
You got it!
Marceline, if you're thinkin' about your dad so much, then... why don't you go see 'im?
Not worth what effort?
Oh, yeah?!
Wwwwhhhat?!  Whoa... whoa!! Aaagh!!
I... reunited you with your family?
I'm not evil, Marceline's dad. I'm super good!
What're you doing?!
WHAGhNO!!
I've unleashed evil onto Ooo ! We've gotta stop 'im, Marceline!
Hey! How do I kill this guy, anyway?
Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean
Oh...
There!! Below us! A gathering of Fluffy People! May-haps they've seen your father! Marceline... release the Finn-bomb!  They're all freaked out!
No! We gotta help this guy. I've got some soul food that Jake packed for me. You like, uh, collard greens or country-fried steak?
How will that help hi?
Oh, clam! But first you gotta return the souls your dad sucked back to these sad, little husks. Right, Marceline?
We can work together! And smash 'im with this rock! And once he's smooshed, all the souls will go back to their rightful bods.
Marceline!! Keep 'im right there!! HrrrrRAAAAGH!!!
You blew it, dude. We're supposed to be a teama team whose sport is stop-your-dad-from-suckin'-souls... ball.
Aw, man! He's growing huge!
I'm gonna take 'im down!
Oh, yeah? Well, this ant's about to get in his pants!
You know!  Because I'm going to make him uncomfortable while I release those souls! RAAAAAAAAGH!!!  Give up those souls, Marceline's dad! In the name of justice!!
NO ONE FLICKS ME IN THE BUTT WITHOUT MY CONSENT!!!  Whoooaa!!  The souls... Lumpy Space Princess! He got your soul, too?!
Well, I'll save you... I'LL SAVE ALL OF YOU!!
BUT!!
NO, WAIT! Marceline!! Keep talking to 'im! When he's talking, he can't steal souls!!
Diversion... need... diversion.
YALALALALALALALALALALALALA!!!!!
MALOSO VOBISCUM ET CUM SPIRITUM!!   I'll see you in the Nightosphere, ya sick freak.  YES!!!!
How could I... save the day?
How could I embarrass-save you??  WHOA! Marceline!
I'm also exhausted emotionally. Or... wait. I mean, I mean physically.
Oh, Jake's in here. 'Sup, Jake?Yup! Yeah, totally stuck that landing!
Man, it's been so long since I've worn the Jakesuit. I forgot how awesome your bod is, bro. Stretchy-arm power!  I feel unstoppable!  Bam! And I don't even feel it!   BMO, throw your plate at me!
Yeah, BMO, show me the stuff, keep it coming!  Yeah, BMO, unleash the beast!
Come on, BMO, bring it, that's nothing!   You're weak, BMO!
You OK, BMO?
That's right!
Dog, the Jakesuit is mad strong! This junk could protect me from anything!
Septuple flip off the tree house!
Ride 'em cowboy! Woo!
Why didn't you stop me?
C'mon bro, taking pain is easy. You just have to imagine that every bruise is a hickey from the Universe. And everyone wants to get with the Universe.
I bet I would be saying that nonsense.
Do it bro, get in here!
Man, are you kidding?
You have to like, punch me in the face.
Dude, I'm graceful. Mom raised me graceful.
Dude, what the Bjork?
Uh, Jake, what are you doing?
Dude, come on, don't do this.
I don't know. A couple hours
It's actually not that bad. There's a bunch where he knows he's dreaming. Here, let me read you a little.  So I said to the first guy, if everyone in my dream is me, then you are me. And he said, I am who? And I said, me. And he said, who is me? And I said, you.  And he said, what about you? And I said, no you!  It's like he's trying to solve a mystery that doesn't exist! You want me to keep going?
Yeah, I'm hungry too. How about a truce while you go make us some lunch?
You know, you could use the opportunity of cooking me food to mess with me.
Yeah?  Uh-oh. Oh, look out, you gonna make me something gross? Soemthing spicy? You know I can take it!
Meatloaf? That's my favorite dish.
What did you do to it?
Okay, well, you're really terrible at this.
Oh, that's just mean.
Nah, I'm good.
Jake, it's my special occasion phone! Someone's calling me to tell me about a special occasion.
So can you walk me over there? I wanna see who it is!  Oh, it's Flame Princess.  I'll talk to her later. I don't want you embarrassing me or, uh, anything.
Jake! Seriously, don't do this!
No, absolutely not.
What?
Jake, whatever you're about to do, please don't do it.
I will!
So, what are we doing, bro?
Fire Wolves? That's your plan? Please.
Eh, whatev.
Hmm. Looks hot.
I'm ready, bro! Bring it! You're nothin', lava! You're a bum! I can handle you!
Never!
Bring it! Yeah, baby, feels good, love it, lovin' that heat on my skull!
Oh, yeah, give it to me!
What happened? You robbed me of the win!
Yeah boy! In yo' face!
No!Hey, man.
Yeah.
So... how's your experiment going?
So... are you ready to come home?
Umm... what are you doing again?
You're right. I don't understand. But I'm cool with your mystical journey or whatever. I'm gonna leave this walkie-talkie so we can stay in touch. Just in case.
Dude, BMO is, like, really worried about you.
I will.  Well, I guess I should head back.
Yeah, well, it took me, like, half a day to get here. Besides, you're just a brick, right?
Alright, see ya, Jake!
Hey, man. You know I can hear everything you say, right?
Yeah, but you saw me leave the walkie-talkie, and I left it on. You know that, right?
Need anything? A soda?
So what's Mr. Bunny doing now?
Oh. Sorry, man.
Sorry, man.
Look, we'll, uh, we'll leave you alone.
Jake? Jake? You there, buddy? Over.
Hey, man. You ready to come home?
Awesome. See you soon.  Yus!Hey Jake! Hey Lady! We came to see your new pups!
Aww! Oh! That's a butt.  Preeeeetty cute!
Dude! Real talk! Are you worried about bein' a dad?
Oh dude, Mom! She'd have been so proud to see you and your pups.
We were just wrestling! Cool uncle wrestling.
Okay.
Oh.
Yeah, okay.  I guess we'll take off.
Ah, no prob, Bob. Huh, congrats again.
Is everything okay?
Oh.

What's that?Thanks for cook-a-looking for us.
Hey, yeah. How can we aid thee?
It is a big deal, and I demand deets.
Whoa, how do you know?
Princess, we vow to protect your juice. Right, Jake?
Uhh, Princess, let's continue this briefing outside. I can't look at his mouth when he gets like this.
Dude, are you trying to freak her out?
Are you trying to freak me out?
Jake, what are you...
Jake?
What's wrong?
Uhhh...
Dude, I'm not going to sing mom's lullaby in front of other people...
Alright, real quick while the princess is distracted. .
Dude, stop playing games! This is serious!
Cat... noise? Oh, cats go meow. Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow.

Everything's not cool, Wildberry Princess is still in danger!
Huh? Jake!
The assassin!
If you let Jake die, so help me I will kill you too!
Give me the antidote!
Face me, cat!
Ugh, ow!
Give it up, Me-mow! You're only making my face look cooler!
Ha, you think you're hurting me? With that tiny dagger?
It's over! Give me the antidote!
No! You... milk-lapper!  Jake, come lick this treebark!
Oh, no...
How you feeling, dude?
Nice defense mechanism, Wild B!Jake...? Jake?  Hey, man.

Yeah? Me, too. Princess Bubblegum's ready for us, so we should go.
It's okay, man. Justjust play it off. Just make aa normal face.  See? Normal face.
Thanks for bringing us along on the trip, Preebs.
Heh. Dude, James is kind of, uh, goofy.
Ugh! Everyone okay?
Huh?  Oh, my garf! What are they?!
Uh... let's radio for help.
Don't panic, baby.
Hey, Preebos, I know things seem bad, but I'll figure out a plan.
What the skunk?!
James, it's all sanched up!
Right, right. Okay, time for plan B. James, pass me them flares.
James, where are the flares?!
You want to do this trust-huddle style, buddy?
Yeah. Do you think James could be breaking things on purpose?
Hey, that gives me an idea.
Ah, I got bunkus. Wait. If we jam up to that cliff face, I think we can climbwhoop.  More goo bros.
What the?!
Who shot that flare, James?
You're right. There's only one way out of this jam. One of us has to eat the big one so the others can survive.
And I'm gonna be that one. I'll run up there and get the creatures to chase me, and while they're busy noshing on my teen-boy body, you three can climb to safety. Don't try to talk me out of it. I got crystal certainty. This is what it means to be a he
Ugh! Huh? Why didJake?

Hey, it's okay BMO. Look, Jake and I will make you a funny face.
What the?!
Yeah, man.
Man, we should do it to! Do his thing and spread the good will!
Yeah!
Finn the Human!
Finn!
I think we should find an easier person to cheer up. It was a mistake to visit a funeral.
That is so perfect!
Man, what's he doing that we're not? We just gotta figure that out.
You're documenting our creative flow in case we make a breakthrough.
Let's check the video.
Yeah, right there, speed it up.
Slow it down.
Good, good, happy is what we want.
Yeah, it's good,  but if we want to be James Baxter good, we gotta to go deeper.
Hey, hey man!
Where is the studio to make the best feel-good sound?
Hold up.... This way...
Right here.  Good!
We know to figure out how to make our sound...  force happiness into the listener!
Check our data?
Maybe it should be higher?
Let's both agree that that sound belongs there.
Hmm, something's missing.
Yeah, James Baxter don't just got his catch phrase, he has his beach ball bizz!
We just crushed it, homie.
You're building it up too much.  Let's just do it.
Oh good, you're still here! Hey, I know we were here yesterday  and we came off as inappropriate...
Right, okay!
Dude!!
Jake, come on man, I need some help!
Whoa,  it's milk!
Don't worry, Jake, I'll block this one!
What?
Well, sort of.Huh?  Oh, my garf! What are they?!
James!
I wanted to do it. Why didn't you let me?
Wow. James sacrificed his life for you again, PB.
Yeah, obviously we'll have to re-clone him.
But it's James!
No...
Yeah, he ate that whole cupcake. What a guy...
Is this... James heaven?
James...
You faked your own death?
James...
Dude, I've been to your funeral like twenty-five times.
Hmm hmm!
We like you James but, you're on your own. We're gonna sit this one out.
This should be good.
Very enjoyable!
Yoink!
Heeyah!Aww! Don't touch the monsters! They'll melt you! Oh my jerbs! Jake! Let's help these candy orphans!  Hey kids!
Dat's my boi, Jameses!Nice job, Mr. Birthday Boy.
Man, you are like another year older, but you look good. Like, super good.
Oh yeah, mom and dad. Hey, did mom and dad tell you any stories about when you were born?
Never told you what?What??

Huh? Huh? Huh?  Jake?
The worm!   Worm... worm... Woyyym! Worm!!
Jake?  Yeah. I think so.  Yep.
Me, too! I was just in some other part of the dream with Princess Bubblegum and Flame Princess.
What?!  No, it wasn't like that!
...Lady's got two mouths...
Weird...  Ouch! What was that for?
Whoa... Well... Pep-but told me we gotta find that worm that crawled through that hole and break it.   In my dream  In my dream... suddenly, an unimaginably amazing sword appeared in front of me able to blast the hole open.  Rad!  I usually dream of messed-up stuff, like a shark tryina' bite off my face.
Ohhh.
And then I shrunk down like Jake.
How do you know so much about dreams and stuff?
Heh heh. Oh, yeah.
What??
Who?
Dad??
Maybe he's not really... real.
That scarf looks... familiar...
Man! The worm is fast!
Well, let's catch it with...  ...some big ol' legs!
Then you get... birds!
Ay ay ay ay ay!
Now what?
Jake, are you okay?
Yeah. I'm okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah! ...Hmm.  Was that... was that mirror always like that?  I'm pretty sure this is not normal.
AAH!  Jake, I think we're still dreaming!
You sure know a lot about dream stuff...  You pinched me earlier, but I never pinched you.
It's still a dream. Hmmm... Huh?!
Why're you jankin' up my dreamscape!?
WHAT?!
My life energy?! I use that! Aaagh!  Wait... something's wrong. I'm missing something.  Worm!!  Oh, man... I'm gonna be stuck here... forever.
Huh?
Hmm? Oh, yeah! Thanks, dream Jake!  GET READY TO EAT IT!
Okay, Finn... Concentrate. Deepest... gut... fears!
Oh, gross!  The ocean.  Okay... Okay, that wasn't so bad.  AAAAH!! OH, GLOB! THE LICH!!

Let me hear it!
Come on!
Come on! Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it...Yes! Woo! Woo!
No fair! I have to take off my stuff.
Yeah, dude.
Didn't Lady tell you not to use the Sassage Flare?
Well, don't abuse it man. 'Cause you're gettin'...
'Cause you're gettin' fat.
Wah!  Whoa...
Hey. Relax.
It's not my hat. It's, like, this other thing now.
Yeah, but it's like, living now.
Right. Maybe it's good he's alive.  You were a rad hat, and now you're a rad...little dude.
Yo, bro! Our eyes are down here. C'mon little dude. Let's go live life!
BMO, this is Little Dude.
Cribes!
Little Dude, no!  You don't jump on heads. That junk is rude, Little Dude! You okay, BMO?
Sorry, BMO, he's just excited.
Sorry, Little Dude, but I have to eat.
Okay.
Hey, Little Dude, y'all can get in on this if you promise to be good.  Only good babies get sassages.
Dude, he turned it into poo! This is poo nowsmell it!
Oh, little Deezy. What am I gonna do with you?
Yeah, okay.
Oh!
Shhhh. Little Dude, you gotta chill.  Night-night.
Jake, wake up. Someone's on the house!
Ugh.  No, no, no!
No, not on my head! Poo buns! Poo buns on my head! WAAAAAH!
Ninja.
What are you doing in our house, homey?
Wha? What are you talking about?
Evil magic donks, homey.
Whoa, cool it, man. Let's just fix Little Dude.
Little Dude! Little Dude!
No, Little Dude!
That's a bad Little Dude!
Little Dude! You were supposed to be my buddy!
How is he so strong?
No! Not the Gumball Guardian!
Poor Little Dude. He was just doin' it up the only way he knew how. It's not his fault he was created evil.
Wizard, Mommy-magic this dude back to life.
And this dude  is your pops.
Be good to this dude.
Yup, that's the idea. Jake, looks like I need a new hat.Hello.
Well, I don't want to bore your listeners...
But let's just say the time has come to stop dating princesses... and return to savin' 'em.
Yeah, of course. No games goin' on here.
Yeah, but maybe we should stop talking about this love junk and get back to adventuring.
Now we're talkin'! Don't cry, Slime Princess. We're at your service.
I'm sorry, SP, but I've given up the dating scene.
No.
Hmmm...
Huh?
Whoa! This is amazing! You okay, buddy?
The royal palace?
Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig, what are you doing here?
Alright!
Aw.
I don't know. I'm still jacked up over my lady biz.
Eh.  Okay. Just let it all out.  Why can't I get over you?
Whoo!
Wait, what?!
Uh, I don't feel good about this.
No, wait. I don't wanna do this.
No! This feels weird!
Nooooooooooooooooo!
I'm sorry, Slime Princess. I'm just gonna mess this next trial up.
Pretending to be in love is making me sad. It makes me think about Flame Princess.
That's worse, I think.
No, Slime Princess. Let's practice this smooch.
I'm sorry. II can't!   Bunk this.
I'm going to punch Guillermo in his stupid face until he agrees to leave the kingdom.
Hey, Guillermo! Can you come out here for a... quick meeting?
Hyup!  Hmm.
Hyah! Everyone okay?
Huah!
Guillermo!  Hyuh!  Are you dead, man? Aw, jeez, bro.  Huh? These are olives.
Well, I'm sorry, Blargetha, but you're going to have to spend more time in your metaphorical prison in a real prison 'cause what you're doing is illegal.
Whoops.
I don't want to disappoint all these people.I think she's traumatized, dude.
Heh heh and I was all like Leave him alone! and he was like Make me! and I was like Okay! and then he was like Aaah, my head! Ah haha.  Dude, what are you doing?
Nice King?
Nah, let him keep it. Hey, there's a new king and he's nice, we should offer our services!
You're the nice king, right?
Well, we will honor and serve you.
Yeah! We wanna be your nice knights.
Who do you want us to nice knight against?
W-well, what do you mean?
Managing admirers? We'll give it a try...
Let's move onto something easier. Um, do you like drums?
Are you fond of men with magical abilities?
I don't feel good making a princess cry, this is not how knights are suppose to act.
I'm still not sure...
Can't argue with that!
The Nice King is not looking for a relationship right now.
He's just not ready for a relationship!
I feel terrible, I need to talk to the Nice King about this.
Nice King, may I speak with you for a moment?
I don't like treating princesses this way, I don't wanna... I don't wanna do this anymore.
Oh, it's not that. It's just, princesses are suppose to be treated with niceness.
Hey, what's wrong with you!
What?! No, man!
What?!
I can't punch a princess!
Oooo...
Uuh, I'm sorry, Lumpy Space Princess, I just can't punch you!
Princess no!
King, I'm sorry, I just can't do this anymore: punching princesses, breaking hearts, eh- it just doesn't seem nice at all.
Huh?
What jig?
Oh, wow, awesome! What is it?
Wha?!
Yes, finally something knight-like!
Whoa, Jake, look at all his hair.
Ha ha!  The Nice King's razor , Jake, look, check this out- Aaaah!
Ha ha, you look just like the Ice King.  And so do I.
Ha haa, yeah, even the Nice King!
Nice King!
Yeah and also this!
Let's get him Jake!
He's not the Nice King, he's the Ice King!
Jake, we can't beat up princesses!
Let me help ya!
Yaaaaaaa!!  Now fly, ya liar!
Now that's what I call, a close shave.Do you think it's right for Marceline to invite us to jam without Princess and BMO?
Yeah, man. Balloon music is the future. Listen.
Well, duh. I just started.
What's it say?
That's it?
Hmm.  What are you doing?
Come on! I can't do that! Let's play Cloud Hunt 'til she gets here.
Yeah, that's what makes it awesome, 'cause I know I'll win.
Okay. I count to ten and you go hide somewhere. Then, I gotta try to find you. You can hide... anywhere in here. Anywhere in here, ...but Marcy's house is off limits because she said so. Okay?
Okay. I'm gonna start counting. Ready?
Go! One...  Two... Three... Four... Five... Four...
Cloud Hunt... GOTCHA! Huh. Hmm.  AH-HA!  JAKE!  Get out of there! Marceline's gonna kill you! Jake! I know this isn't a mirror. What the?! You're doing it wrong, even! Get out! Get out!!  Dude, get out of there! She's gonna kill us! She'll be home any minute! Did you read the note?! I mean, you read the note! You told it to me!!
You don't think I know that?! Hmmmmmmm... We'll wait for the right moment and sneak out... right under her big, fat caboose.
Shh, here she comes!
Shh, shh!!
Shh!!
This is Jake!
Get down.  Love, FINN + JAKE] When she gets this, she'll leave and we can escape! When she gets this, she'll leave and we can escape!
I'll fly the paper as an airplane down the bedroom ladder. It'll triple barrel roll past the kitchen, open the fridge, and cook some eggs, then eat the eggs, and unfold itself as it lays in the carpet in front of Marceline's door!
Yeah! Do it!
What? What's it doing?!
Is it safe?
I'm not goin' back out there.
Is she awake?
I'm wondering if she's awake.
I'm whispering.
Disguise yourself, fool!
What the?! DUDE! You shape-changed to look like me?!
We were playing hide-and-seek in your closet and you came home, so we hid in there all day. We saw... everything. And, oh, Glob, I mean, whatever you do to us, I just wanna say, we're sorry.
Marceline?  Jake! Jake!
AAAAAAH!!Not too bad!? I'm better than that!  Huh?  Jake! Do you hear that?
I think someone's crying.  Stop!  This is serious! I gotta go find out where that crying is coming from!
What did you call me?
Hey! Listen up you cold-hearted marauders! Someone's out there crying for help and I'm not gonna ignore that!
A long time ago when I was a baby, I went boom boom on a leaf. Boom! Boom!  And I fell backwards and sat in my own boom boom. I cried for a day. But no one came to help me.  That day I vowed to help anyone in need! No matter how small their problem.  And that's why I need to go.
Someone must be caught in that avalanche! Let's get it on!  So, who's crying?
Whoa! Aww, what's wrong fella? You cryin' boulders?
Ohhhh! I see. You're feeling left out and you wanna roughhouse too! Well I can take you on tough guy! Come on Jake! Back me up!
Huh? Why?
But a smooth well controlled roughhouse bolsters your guts and rejuvenate the muscle.
I'll help you mountain!
I'll stop those roughhousers from being rough!
Yes sir! My names Finn and I'm gonna help you out!
No way! But there's got to be some kind of solution. Ill figure this out Mountain Man!  Yup!
N-nooo! Wait, um, actually, could you guys stop being so rough.
Could you guy just tone down the roughhousing a little?
I think I have a perfect idea!  This'll soften your punches for smooth knock outs. Like punching a dream!
Mathematical.  What do ya think? Fixed all youre problems right!
Im sorry!
Come on Jake. I gotta give this another shot!
Yes I do Jake. Thats what I vowed! To help anyone in need! No matter how small their problem!  At least I have to try brother.
Hey guys. Im back.  Hey guys. Guys? Men! Men. Please stop a second. Men! Boys? Please? I have more to ask of you! Bros? My bros?  Brother?
Alright! This could be it!
Okay, cool. Hey, I'm gonna go tell the mountain.
So, everything's fine this time, right?
So the mountain is totally fine with everyone petting. I feel great.
They look kinda rashy.
No wait fellas! The mountain doesn't like roughhousing.
Well. Well what if we rotate the entire mountain 180 degrees around, so the mountains facing the other direction. That way, you guys can keep roughhousing and the mountain doesn't have to watch it!
What do ya say mountain!
Now I just need to set up some sort of pulley system.
What!? A-but-ahh. Um, maybe what we can do is...
Oh, ah just a second you guys. Ill a- Ill help you out in one minute.
Let me just a-
Huh!?
Everybody please! One problem at a time!
Ahhhhh! Everybody wants different things! And some of them want stuff thats exactly the thing the others dont want.
Hmm. Jake. What I want is to help anyone in need, so everyone is happy!
Ready over there mushroom gang?
Ready dragon?
Ready Mountain Man?
Go!
Well, what's the matter?
That's the opposite of a problem!  Adventure Time!I have no idea.
Because...
Faster, Jake!
Marceline! What's wrong with her?
Tell us how to break the spell.
What? What'd you do to my forehead?
Like this?
Ugh, ah. I can't tell. I don't feel like I'm inside Marceline's memories.
So... if we're in Marceline's memories, where's Marceline?
We're Finn and Jake.
We're trying to wake you up.
I want some! Huh?
Yo, man.
Don't eat those.
It's our treehouse. This must be when Marceline lived here.
Ash, I guess.
This place reeks.
My what?  Oh, my thing.
Wait a sec, Jake. It's that guy again.
The core!
How are we supposed to know which one to grab?
Alright.  Hot or cold?
Huh? Hey, you have arms.
You lied to us.
Marcie, Marcie! You're okay.
You had a magic accident, and we saved you with some help from your wizard friend.
What?
What?
No, Marceline!
They're gone, man. He took her!
Um. Okay, you take that shovel and keep banging it against that shed until Ash comes out to see what's happening. Then I'll sneak in, and I'll rescue Marceline.
Yeah, okay. Sorry Marceline, I'll go. I just gotta show you something first.
Hey, there you are.
It's my old house. That magic powder--it put you in my memories. Me and Jake were in yours before, but Ash tricked us into stealing your memory of you breaking up with him. But it's okay because I saw the memory. Now I have a memory of your memory in my memory. See?
You gonna be okay, Marceline?Jake, why didn't you stick to the plan?
Sick. No. Just try to follow the plans, okay?
Come on out, cuties. It's safe now.
Hey, you hear something? Up there.  It's a fat, fat warrior beat. It's all...   It calls me forth.
Mmmm... Maybe.
Nah. This is a trap.
Then I'd bet the exits would all magically seal behind us.
Yeah. That sounds... so dumb... and FLIPPING AWESOME!
Yeah. Okay.
I'mma beat you with your own thing. Give it up!  Hah-hah!  Ooomph!
Yeah. Ah-ha-ha-ha.
Yeah.
Aw, man. Okay, it was fun. I'm keeping the branch.
Hmm. Okay, I have a plan. We'll do what the Fight King says, and defeat his ghosts to earn our freedom.  You're gonna follow my plan, right?
That's an entirely different plan... than my plan. What's the hula-hoop for?
We're ready... I guess, Fight King.
Yup. This is dog.
Heh.
Hah. Word.
Sorry, man. But you crossed my kill zone.
Plan? What plan?
Yeah. I fight. To hear bones breaking and meat tearing.
I fight... to FIGHT!
We're ready for our next fight, Fight King.
Habet! Habet! Habet! Heh-heh-heh.
This next take-down is for you, my king! Rahhh...  Heh-heh-heh.
Eludere!
Hoc habet! Whaaa!
I have defeated every gladiator.
Who?
Fight King, this Jake was a farce. Let me face the real Jake!
Yes, my king.
This is the plan, Jake! Raah!
That's right! Everything has been building to this! The final battle! Brother against brother! TO THE DEATH!
Fight King!!! I can't do it.  I can't kill him, Fight King. I can't kill my best friend.
Not without a BIGGER SWORD!
Wink.
Mmm-hmm.
Pretty much.
Because you always bungle my plans. But, if you had bungled this one...  I might have, for real, chopped your head off.
Hey, Jake, you notice how all these ghosts are walking in pairs?
But now they're free!Jake! What am I supposed to be meditatin' about?
Can we go with?
Whoa!
What's that sound?
That's freakin' nuts!
Dude, be a big sword!
No. That will not happen.
I love it.
Here I go!
Yeah, man! We gotta shut this fool down hardcore!
Run through it, man!  We gotta get beyond Iceberg Lake before the Lich!
What the heck, Ice King?!
Why are you following us?!
No!
Ice King, go away, man.
No thanks, guy. Hmm? How does this gauntlet  work?!
I can't turn it off!
Phew!
After his butt!
Here! I'll help paddle!  Hey. It's me.  Aw, come on. I'm sorry I punched you in the ball.
Ah, yeah, haha! Closing in... Gonna get you, man!  Closer, Jake!  Closer... closer...
PRINCESS?! NO!
ICE KING!!
Don't worry, Princess!
I don't have time for this!
My pack!!
The Lich!
No!  Prepare thyself... to get smote in the name of Bubblegum!!
Oh, no.

Sorry about that, Peebles.
Whoa, Raggedy Princess! It's so awesome! Thank you.
We should wheel 'er to her bedroom, right?
Like fake magic?
We picked every flower in the Candy Kingdom just for you!
Princess Bubblegum?
Quiet, dude. We're supposed to take care of her, not make her feel bad!
She's just messed up from the accident, man. We just have to take care of her 'til she feels better.
Princess! Princess, no! You shouldn't be out of bed!  Princess... I... I gotta tell ya somethin'. Uh... Jake...
Princess... this sweater you made me kept me safe. I almost got super messed up, but... it saved me. And I wanted to say... thank you for imbuing this sweater with the power of liking someone a lot. Because... I like you a lot.   Haha, uh... We shouldn't talk about this now. You should rest.
Yes, Princess.
Jake!
I'm gonna get some stuff for PB. Be right back.

Whaaah?... Ice King? What are you doing here?
You don't know that.
Listen, you old poot. I'm not going to let you kill 'er twice. GET STUFFED. Come on, Jake.
We're coming, Princess!
Dump that mess! I'mma set 'er free with my like-like sweater!

NOOOOOOO!!!!
13 years old? That's how old I am.  Uh...Don't worry! His spells never last long.
Yeah! You never fought them? They come out every day at four oclock on the dot.
You should stay, man. At five o'clock every day, I chop both their heads off, and they grow them back for the next day.
Boo!
Yeah.
What? What did she say?
Oh.
We do?
Oh, I have a joke!  Okay,  okay. Knock knock.
Diarrhea!
Did she say diarrhea who?
What's the joke?
Man, I- I might leave. Is it okay if I leave? I kind of want to go fight something.
The lake guarded by evil Lake Knights?
Whoa   Jake! Youre inviting Rainicorn? No offense, but isn't she a little too sweet for deadly adventure?
Hmmm. Alright! Trust pound!
Underwater camouflage!
Lady! You are incredible! You should adventure with us all the time!
Uhhh, what?
I like this voice!
Whatever you say grandpa!  Hai-yah!
Hey grandpa, how are you able to fly if you don't have wings?
Shmow!  That forest wizard is giving away free power rings!
Yeahs!
Whoa! Did you see that!? This is like the funnest thing ever!
Wait a minute, you didn't fly down with us?
Jake! Check out these power rings!
Yeah! Lady got some too.
Uh, You want one of mine? Ive got so many.
Oh. Wait, I can't take them off. I guess they're cursed.  Still pretty cool though.
Alright this time Im gonna destroy you Rainicorn!
Oh I got the sword!
Lady and I are going to a party in the Cloud Kingdom tonight.  You should go to that with us.
Jake stop sighing you're messing up my game!  Jake!  Whats goin' on with you!
Awww dang it! Man, Lady, youre too good at this! Hey, It's time to party with clouds! Jake, you comin'?
Dude, I thought you wanted to spend more time with me and Lady together?

Yeah! Now make that orange!  And make that purple!  Wow Lady! Hanging out with you it the best!
Man, I wish Jake was here having fun with us.  Hey, wheres that music coming from?
Stop! You're making Lady jealous!
Why would I be jealous of Tiffany?
Yaaaaaaahhh!  Home wrecker!
Get out of my life Tiffany! And never come back
Beat it Tiffany! Go on! Get!
Shut up man, I don't wanna hear that stuff.  Lemme get in there.
Wait! Let's always be stupid! Forever!This is the spot? Right here?  What was that?!
What theThis is very strange.
Who in this world is sadder than the Ice King?Jake! Is that you? I can't see!
I'm blind?! Jake! I'm blind on my birthday!
Oh...
Orange blindfold? That is a surprise!
You got me a train?  Thank you, Jake!
Huh?
Oh. Almost as cool as a free train!
Okay!
Hey! Mr. Conductor! It's ma birthday!
This is gonna be the best birthday ever!
Great! Now find your seatbelt.
Hey! We're in the straight-away!
A skeleton...  Is he going to be okay, Doctor Donut?
Are you kidding? It's a murder mystery! On a train!  And we're gonna solve it.
What'dya think, Doctor Donut? Any clues?
Passengers, passengers! I don't think it was Colonel Candy Corn.
No, in murder mysteries it's never the first person you think of. Never ever.
Colonel, do you have any enemies on this train?
See? I knew it wasn't him!  But now we need to figure out who his enemy is. It could be anybody.
Yes it could.  Except I didn't do it.
You singled me out to take suspicion of yourself! Are you Colonel Candy Corn's enemy?
Suspect numero uno!
Rat traps! Really thought I was onto something!
No it's definitely not him.
'Cause he's weird and creepy. And you never suspect the creepy guy because he's too obvious.
We're running out of suspects. And we're running out of time.
Hey Jake.
The conductor was just here and he was weirder and creepier then before.
Anyway, it's still not him. ] No. The murderer is right here among us.  No. The murderer is right here among us. [Walks to Doctor Donut]] Isn't that right, Doctor?
When Candy Cane guy was murdered, you diverted suspicion to Colonel Candy Corn.  Then killed him to protect your alibi.
Am I? Or am I way on.
Son of a-
My hunches aren't getting me anywhere! The killer is laughing at us, Jake.
Hmmm... We need hard  evidence!
Ha!  A basket of eggs, fish and cabbage!
It's a receipt! From an earlier train ride. From another train!
Jake! I found a book! It's a dictionary!
It's sheet music!
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Yes! Jake, that's it! It's all so clear now! Gather everyone in the caboose and I will reveal a murderer!
You're the only remaining passengers. So the murderer, is in this caboose.
Let me explain how I know who the murderer is.  I saw Pineapple Guy skim through the sheet music. Sheet music to a song that's very special to Lollipop Girl. A song that reminds her of Ice Cream Guy.   Before Colonel Candy Corn's aide, Doctor Ice Cream was in possession of a basket of cabbage, fish and eggs.  And you, Pineapple Guy, have cabbage bits on your socks!  And you!  Chocolate Bar Guy!  Does this dictionary look familiar? A dictionary that contains the words  Rid!  Guests!  At once!
But the real murderer is someone no one suspects! The real murderer is-
No one was the murderer?!
Oh yeah! He did it.
I knew it; because he's creepy.
I know. You knew he was the murderer all along. I couldn't have done it without  you, you, you
You feel kinda bony.  NOOOOOOOOOOO!
How could you murder all those Candy People?! And, you murdered Jake on my birthday!
Wrong!
I'm coming for you!  This is for Jake!  You're going down, or both of us are going down!  My birthday wish, is vengeance!  Happy birthday to me!!
You're alive!!  You were the conductor the whole time?!
So nobody was murdered?
Hey, we're alive!
Wow, this is the best birthday ever. Thanks, Jake.
I think my favorite part was landing on the Gelatin. That musta taken forever to plan.
Oh. So we could have...What was your count?
Uh, 3 minutes, 30 seconds.
No, I was just pointing at my wrist.
Hey, Rattleballs, are you sure you're waterproof?We're coming!
Grab him, Jake!
Whatever.
Oh, what happened? Where's the deer? Paging Dr. Ice cream! Dr. Ice cream cream for my mouth!  Ahh, dude, I broke my stems! Hello? Jake? Princess? What the blizz. Come on, people.
Yeah, I'm awake, but my jams are all busted.
So, what happened? Did you save everybody?
So, Jake, there's nobody here. Did you notice that?
From what?
What?!
She told you?
Oh, yeah, okay. So, wait, the whole kingdom is in on it?
Okay, man, and how do we do that?
The what?
Whoa. When did you find time to build this?
Hm. So, what should I do now?
Okay.
A hobo fi-ya, fi-ya, fi-ya.  Boy, it sure is quiet around here! Uh-huh! I'd probably pee all over myself if somebody jumped out and surprised me!  Oh, ugh! I stink! How long was I out for? A day or two?  Huh. What a convenient place to bathe.  Sure seems like a good time to come out if y'all are just hiding and you don't, you know, wanna see me  pop my top!  Ahh, yeah, that's fresh. I nobody's gonna jump out of the bushes and peeps my bod!   Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl! Hmmm.
Jake?
I'm starting to question your theory about the surprise party.
But what if they're in trouble?  What if something happened to them? We should try looking around.
Dude, are you okay?
Okay, I promise.
Hey, it's you!  Thanks for breaking my legs, ya dumb-butt!
That sounds like Candy People!
Jake. Jake!
I heard a sound coming from the sewer! We should check it out.
I'm being patient! I waited all day, Jake!
Wait, what are you saying?
Have I been asleep for six months?!
Face it, Finn, your best friend is gone.
Oh, my Glob!
Hey, Jake! What are you doin'?
Can I join your puppet party? We'll have twice the puppet voices!
Naw, man, I'm with you. Happy birthday, Jake. Really.
And I have a surprise for you! Close your eyes and don't open 'em until I tell you.
Yeee-ow!
Whup!
Hello?
You... you did this?
Stop being crazy!
Mah!
A deer skronked your head and you lost your mind, man! You imprisoned the Candy People for your own sick birthday fantasy. Look.
Then who did?
Grrrr! Jake, you free the Candy People. I'll take on the deer. Naw-hyah!
Huh?  Donk!
How's your noggin?
Hmm, still broken.
Um... pyew! It's stanky in here!
Let's go home so we can get baths.Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
Yeah, uh, when do we get our house back?
Nah, man. It's really not so bad. Let's just sleep on it tonight.
Yeah, man. It's tough. I'm a tough kid.
Ugh!
Man, can I tell you something? I don't even know what's going on, here. I mean, like, what the heck is a deed? How come he can buy our house when it's our house and Marceline gave it to us and we live there?! A-and now we're arrested? This is crazy!  It's crazy!!
They're not?
Whoa, just like Kim Kil Whan.
Yeah! Awesome!
I don't know, but I'm not tryin' to be sleepin' on a ladder anymore, so let's just get a bunch of scroot together and buy our house back. Then you two can hash it out later.
Well, actually, I was thinking maybe Kim Kil Whan was right. Maybe we should get jobs or somethin'.
Yes!
Watch it!
Bad news, ya scrat! We're buying our house back!
Yeah!
I'm gonna be frank, here. Your son's a real-time jingle-blaster.
Oh, wait. You know, like, like maybe he's got a secret problem he can't tell us about, like with mob goonslike, like gambling debts or something.
You sure this is right, Jake? I've never seen this place before.  Looks like a fairy tale.
Whoa. Kim Kil Whan is rich, like wow, like, hello, what? But if he doesn't need our money, what does he need?  Throw pebbles at the glass to get his attention.
Yeah!Come back, thief!
You can't just go around stealing boots.
He's getting away in that lake!
Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! ...Huh?
Uhh...
I'm coming, Jake. I'll poot on that newt as soon as I'm barefoot. Uh...
Ow! Why is my stomach going nuts?
Ow!
Wh-wh-wh-Who are you?
What? I'm not afraid of lakes, wells, or rivers, streams, or deep wells or puddles. Why would I be afraid of-
I'm no wuss! I'm the hero around these parts!
Not true! I'm not scared of nothin'!
I shall conquer my fear.
No! I will. I'll conquer my fear.
Jake. I think I'm afraid... of the ocean.
I need your help to overcome my fear. Will you do it?
Jake! Come on!
Don't be scared. I shall not be scared.
I'm afraid! Ah!  Jake, get me out of the water! Now, Jake! Now! Now!
Jake!
But I must conquer this now!  I'm not afraid of you!
I'm afraid of you! I'm afraid of you!
Ok, yeah. Let's try tomorrow.
Morning, Jake.
Yeah, man.
I'm askin'!
Jake, are you crazy? This is not an OK thing to do!
You're nuts.
Really? Ok. I'm calming down.
Yeah, man. I can do it.
Jake, this isn't a joke! It's touching me!
I'm trying to let it hold me.
This isn't working!
W-what?
What?!
Get me away, Jake! Now, Jake! Now! Right now! Get-Get me away!
I'm safe! I'm safe! How'd I do?
What? I made it all the way to level three.
You have to help me. I can't do this without you.
I swear I won't hit you anymore.
I swear... and pigs have hair.
What? I thought you said it was a three step plan... man.
Yeah. It's pretty math... you psychopath.
Whoa...
Hey. This isn't that bad. I'm actually glad.
No, Jake! Turn around! Turn around!
Noooo!
Jake? Jaaaaaake!
Jake!
You're right.
If my body won't let me rescue my best friend, then there's only one thing left to do.
Jake! Jake! Wake up!
You ok, dude?
What?
Thanks, dude.
What the flip, man? I just swam to the bottom!
He's right. I'll never be a hero.
Wait... Why did you wait so long to tell me?
It's time for you to go away, Fear Feaster!
Everybody has a flaw... and it looks like yours is smelling like my nasty guts.Hey BMO, where's Jake?
OK, BMO.
You wanna join my primitive noise band?
Pssssh!It's slippin', dude.
Phew.  Raini-corni-copia? An Unabridged History of the Rainicorns.  Whatever, man. I barely even made it through the title.
Huh.  Oh.  Hey, this table is wobbly. We gotta take it to the Lost Tinker Goblin of Fog Mountain to fix it.
I don't make up adventures! Jake, you know that! Jake! I don't make up adventures!  Hm.  Books, books.  Kitties, Zitties, Witties, Mitties, Knitties, Fitties, Hitties, Jitties, Pities, Cities...  Oh, no! Damaged books? Who did this?!
Sorry.  I will avenge thee, slightly-soiled books. Gotta tell Jake.
Hello?  Is someone back here? Are you stuck?
Hello?  Whoa! Ohhh! Hey, there's pages comin' outta these books!
Who are you dudes?
I'll call you Pete.
Why are you dudes in the library?
Yeah?
Wow, yeah.
Gosh! Even the Rainicornicopia?
I better tell Jake. Don't you dudes go anywhere.
Hey, bro, I've got an adventureand it's not made up! There are these- these Pagelings they came out from- from books! And they- they folded into little animals.
Do you hear what I'm saying?!
You think I'm making this up?
I'll prove it to you!
Jake, wait till you see 'em.
Ow.
They were just here! Pagelings?
Why didn't you dudes introduce yourselves to Jake?
Ummmm... yeah, but Jake is a powerful giant like me! He can help you battle or- or whatevs! But first, you must win his favor. Do you not want victory for your people?
C'mon, follow me.  Jake, look.
He's up here reading a book.
Do something to get his attention.
Okay.
Jake, the Pagelings are dancing for you. Just look up for a second!
You can feel them, can't you?
Just look up for a second!  Looooook.  Uhhh. Pagelings, I'm sorry, but my friend is acting like a clump.
I'm not making believe!
So, those little squishy guys are the Moldos?
Uh-huh. They seem tough.
Hmmm... their bites sting, eh? I've got a plan, Pete.
Just trust me.  Trust me.
Eh, it wasn't very hard.
Wibba-wibba-wah!
Whoa. Whoa, moldy blobs. I've come here to help the Moldos defeat the Pagelings.
Calm down, this is part of my plan.
Well... here, look.  I brought you all a prisoner. It's their leader.
So, do you guys have, like, alike, a leader or somethin'?
Oh, uhh... hmm.  Nice to meet you, your highness.
That's adorable.  Now, Finn!
Pete, j-just stop winking.  Hyah!
Ignore this!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ummm...
Uhhh... come on, you guys, knock it off.
The Moldos got a taste for ya now.
Gotta do something. Where can I find ways to solve problems in a library?  Books?  Books! Books! Books!
Huh? Whatcha nibblin' me for?
Hmmm. Tastier than battle beast fur. Yis!
Hey, Mildwin. Mildwin!
I bring a peace offering from the Pagelings.
Hang on, buddy. Paper Pete?
Naw, man. The war's over.  Mildwin, you can keep my shirt if  you don't attack their library books.
And in forty years, you can have my shorts. Sound good, Pete?
Sound good, Jake?
Look, man! Moldos and Pagelings are real!
Did you finish your Rainicorn book?
Oh. What about relating to your mixed-species kids?
Oh. Well... hey, man, I think I see some, um...  Sun People in trouble on the sun over there.
Mmhmm.
WHOO! WHOOOO!Gear dumped, bro!  How about this room, bro?
Home, sweet home, bro.
Just until Gunter finishes rebuilding the Ice Kingdom.
It's not that bad, Jake.
Look, I hear you. But we can't kick him out because I still feel guilty about junking up his crib. Hey, what if we check him into a hotel room?
What's that?
Hey, Simon, how would you like to stay in the Coolest Hotel?
We'll even put you up for few weeks until your place is ready.
Hehe, yeah?
No. I-I have another idea.
Oh, my gosh! Someone's at the door. We have a doorbell now. We'll get it.
What are you doing here?
Yeah, man! You don't even need a reason to stop by!
Come on, dude, we got cookies and the cocoa!   Dang! But you're funny, Abracadaniel!
Fantastic.
So good! Whoo!
Uhh-huh. Pretty soon, he'll be outta here for good.
Yeah!
Ice King? What's up?  Huh? What the flip?
Um,  whoo! That was great, guys!
Uh,  actually, Jake and I have got, uh, got some stuff to take care of.
'Sup, ABD?
You're afraid of the dark?
Gee. Well, I guess you can crash here for the night.
Wait! Are you really afraid of the dark?
Okay. Well, you can sleep on the couch. We're gonna go. Uh, good night.
Dude!!
Ahh! The sword!
I just can't do it, Jake. This is Dad's sword!
Whoa.
You got your blood, now get outta here!
Jake?You got that cooler, buddy?
Good, 'cause we're gonna need it for this... ROOF PARTY!  Watch this, everybody! Triple flip with chips for the dip!
YUP! YAH!

Whoa. Dude, can you, like, get offa' me?

Jake! That party was super fun!
Then go to sleep, man!
Hyump! Ahh!  Goodnight, hamlet.
Huh?  UNTIE ME SO I CAN BEAT YOU WITH THAT SACK!!  You're that
'S pretty nice. Hey, why don't you guys just untie me, and we can pretend this whole thing didn't happen?
Uh-oh.
It's me.
That does what now?
THAT'S BIZONKERS!
Huh?
Ha! You may have captured me... Hugh!  ...but you can't make me run!  Ow! Well... you can't make me run very fast.  OW!! Jake's on his way to mess you guys  UUUOOOOAAAHH!!
NO! STOP! NOOOOO!!!! WHA! AAH!!

Don't think, Finn... Don't think anything.  Can't... let... them... WIN!!  No more games. No... more... PAJAMAS!!!
Jake?!?!
Wha?!
Jake?!  JAKE!!!  You defeated the Gnomes!!
Yeah, man!!
Yeah, man, I'm fine!!!
Hahaha, yeah, dog!!Yeah, what's his beef?
Yeah. Yeah, and I could wear all black and I could be like, you know, like, your shadow.
Yeah. Let's bust it.
Psst! Get ready, Jake. When we get to the cookie, you throw some milk in his face and yell, Alvin's hot juicebox. Alvin's hot juicebox. He'll be really confused, and that's when we grab him and tie him up-style.
Yeah. Change of plansI'll go take care of those chips. You keep the cookie distracted.
Okay, awesome.
Alvin's hot juicebox! Alvin's hot juice
Jake! What are you doing?! What happened to the plan?
What? But-but he's a criminal!
Whaaaat?
Um... 'gainst?  WAAAH! Oof.Wait... what?!
Peebo?
Eh...okay, calm down...
Whoa! Gals... we'll find this crazy freak and return all of your body parts!
It's... it's okay, Hot Dog Princess! We'll be right back.
Ice King, we know you did it!
What's h Oww...
A mo-mo-mons-mo.....
If we look at her with these mirrors, her ugliness will have no effect on us.
Hey, Ice King!
Do you give up?!
Yeah, mans. Wait... where'd your wife go?
Huh?Ow ow, ow!
Man, I wish I had my other sock, this callous is gonna junk up my good time at PB's potluck.
You look like a target.
Bounce House! Come on, Jake!  Bounce bounce!
Oh my goodness, sorry Bounce House Princess, I didn't know it was you.
Mmm that's okay. Come on, Jake, let's, eh, go party.
Hello. Hello, Princess Princess Princess, hey, Embryo Princess, heeey youuu.
I've been going foot nude in the shoe and now I got this turbo huge callous.
Mysterious. Oh, brought something for the party!
Bam! Soda!
It's warm and I shook it up... a lot.
Awww, hey Jake, check out this cat.
Do you like fresh lemon in your ice tea?
Hmm, hey, Gunter, let me get one of them socks.
Oh... ow.
Ice King, don't make me stand up and whomp you!
That's.... IT!
Why are you doing this, IK?!
Only if you promise to stop acting nanners.
Whoa, cool.
Awesome.Oh, no, our sled's broken! Hey, let's build one out of snow!
What are you doing, Jake?
Okay!
Switch back! Switch back!
Penguins!
Ha Ha!
Aww, Ice King's here.
Oh ho oh! Holy cow!
Yeah! There's a big sleeping lava man in our front yard, and he is SOOOOOOOOOOOO hot!
Wait, wait, no, I take it back. I mean, not like sexy hot.
No, I mean--
Why don't you just try being cool.
Heh heh, yeah.
Huh, Wildberry Princess? Hot Dog Princess? W-what's goin' on?
Ice King!
Why are you keeping these girls prisoners, jerk?
Ice King, don't do this. Just let the girls go. They don't want to be here.
Don't worry, princesses. I pledge that Jake and I will protect each and everyone of you and furthermore I see all of you happily married to whatever sweet thing y'all want to be married to!
Rad! All I need is something to spear the Ice King with.  Binoculars... toothbrush... quilt...  sweater... trail mix... my flute!
My flute!
Darn it!
Jake!
Ice King! You better either set us free or come in here and fight me 'cause otherwise I'm gonna flip out!!!
ICE KING!!!...
Huh? Jake, you alright?
Oh my gosh. I'm sorry, princesses. Slime Princess, are you alright?
I understand. And, Lumpy Space Princess, how do you fair?
Leave her alone, Ice King!
I've almost devised a plan. I'm gonna let him drum till' I've finalized the details in my mind.
Ah! It was fun! Hey, you should get some more fun stuff.
Good idea, indeed.
Alright. I've got a plan on how to get out of here. First everyone needs to be dancing and laughing and saying fun stuff like Whoopee! Okay, when the Ice King comes back, everyone play it up, like we want him to come inside the jail and party with us and when he steps inside, I'm gonna beat the tar out of him with these...  ...while you all take care of Jake. Everyone on board with this?
Good point, Lumpy Space Princess.
We're having fun! Whoopee!
He's not buying it. Dance harder.
Wanna dance with us, Ice King? Come on!
No! That is not the case! You're nuts, man! And I don't know how to help you! Probably because I'm just a simple dude. So maybe you should talk to someone with more life experience, like Jake!
But you gotta get it in you're head, man! Putting princesses in jail is wrong!
You're welcome, Slime Princess!
Yeah...
Oh, heh heh, well how 'bout that... Jake, help me!
Heh heh, I'm sorry. Jake!Uuf!
Come on, Jake...
I guess I'm just thinking about Flame Princess. I told her a joke the other day and she didn't even laugh or anything. I guess it's over between us.
Yeah right, BMO. More like she used up all her laughs on some other guy's jokes probably. Man, having a girlfriend is hard.
I don't even know what you guys are talking about. I think I just need some alone time.  Gotta let my mind fester a bit, you know? I'll be back in a little while.
Man, this looked smaller from the outside. What's this now? What the?! Jake, what's in here?! Jake?
Oh, whoa!  Did Jake build this part too? That guy needs some more girlfriends or something.
Hey Jake! You need more girlf--what the...? Door's gone?
Hmm, maybe there's another door in yonder pillow town.  I don't get this at all.
Huh?
Now this, I understand!    Oh. That's it?
Hey, uh, how's it going?
Hah, it's nothing; I kill things all the time.
Oh, hey there... Um, you can just call me Finn if you want.
Oh, uh...
Heh. Oh, uh, your dad seems fun.
Oh, well...  I...have a girlfriend.
Yeah, okay!  This place is weird.
Naah, just regular poo.
Eh, yeah, i-it's really cool. Where I come from, I live with my best friend, who's my brother. And he's a dog. We fight stuff; it's cool. It's really different than here. I mean, where I'm from, blankets and pillows are used for bedding.
Heh heh uh.
Ah man, it's been nice, Roselinen. But I gotta get back to my home.  Quilton, I need your help to find a portal to my home world.
It tastes... like... a pillow...
Alphanumeric!  Pillow sheep! You have more fluff than sense!
Oh!  What is this!  A pack of fearsome pillow goblins?!
Oh, they have, have they?  Tiny pillows. Mmm mmm mm mmm.
Darling, you've outdone yourself.
What is it, Quilton?
Yes, of course.
Oh my glob.
Quilton, I need to find that door.
Hello?
Are these The Great Abracadabra Mountains? And are you Rasheeta the Great Oracle, dweller of said mountains?
Yes, I've searched for decades--how did you know?
Does it say how I get home?
Uh... yeah!
So there is another way to...  Oof...
Oh...
I think so, but the oracle spoke in riddles.  Gonna have to fester on this one for a bit...
Hmm, that reminds me, Roselinen, of something Jake told me just before I came to this world.
Man. How did he see it all coming so clearly?  Come on, everyone. Pack your things, we're going home.
Whawhere?
I'm... alright.
I remember... back... when I was dad.
I ain't dad yet! Oh, no, wait! Here it comes! Woo hoo hoo hoo hooooo, BOY!
HUP!
Huh? Oh. Uhh, I don't know, man. I just had the number one wildest dream.
Yeah! I was--  Hello? Oh hey! Oh.  Yeah, thanks! Yeah, okay, bye.  That was Flame Princess. She said she didn't get my joke until just now and that it's really funny and awesome!
What dream?
Huh?
Pfft!Ahhh... YEAH!!!
Jake, get ready for a slap in the jowls.  Seriously, though... get ready... for a day filled with adventure!
Yeah, man!!  I wrote on my arm this to-do list of cool junk.  Number one: back flip off this bridge and do the splits. Number two: track down and slay a goblin horde. Number three... storm clouds?
I've never seen a knife storm before... It's beautiful.
Well, what're we gonna do?
Hah! Alright!
'S okay, I guess.
Booooo.
What now?
Whoa! What?!
Barf that! Imagination is for turbo nerds who can't handle how kick-butt reality is! I'm a kick-butt reality master!! I would rather die than be imaginative. I mean that.
Shut up, man...
I'm not playing you child-style games, guy. Watch and learn as I master... reality.
AAAAH!!!  Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Jake! What the hey-hey?!
It's like... whatever you imagine becomes real... That's bananas!
Dude! Imagine that BMO invented a better video game, and that he has new batteries.
But first stop imagining lava!
Imagine turning your imagination off!
Can't you make it easier to get to that machine?
Then it's up to me to take your imagination downtown! Let's go to the den and suit up!
Okay.
Nah. There's a better one over by the desk. Ah! UNH!  What did I just hit?!
Really? That's it? There isn't any invisible, angry troll or anything?
Aah! I can feel it on my foot!  I'll kill you, troll! Yah! Yah! Yah, yah, yah, yah!
Yah, yah!
Cram this! We gotta book it to your imagination machine! Yah!
Okay. Try to imagine some kind of steel umbrella over the bridge so... we don't get knifed.
Haha! Ha! Hey, you did it, man!
An imaginary riddle master?
Ask me your riddle, Riddle Master. I accept your test.
LAY IT ON ME!!
Dude, just make it super easy.
Man, that riddle sucks.
YEAH, RIGHT! I'VE GOT A MISSILE!!
I can feel them all over my face! Imaginary poison coursing through my veins!!
Let's just get to your imagination machine and we'll be okay!!
Hey! Don't shoot us with that bazooka!
Don't you do it...
DON'T DO IT, MAN!!!
AW, YEAH!
Alright, use your powers or something. This poison is about to kill me.
Is it clear?
Oh! I found the shut-off lever!
Alright. I'm gonna turn it off.  UNH!! You said it was clear of danger!!
What?! Well, how do I kill it?!
Okay! I'm doin' iiiit!!  Aw, yeah! The imaginary poison is gone, Jake! Jake?  Hey, come on. Wake up, man.
Jake... what happened to your bombastic personality?
Nah, man, nah. Somethin's wrong. Tell me something amazing!
Ah, see, man, you suck now! Crap, it's your imagination. You need that thing.
Jake... Stop it, man. You're just playing one continuous note.
I'm gonna turn your imagination back on.  Jake! Your imagination on-off switch has vanished!
I remembereth.
No! It was the opposite of that stuff. I know this now...  ...only too late. Okay, man. I'm gonna try to imagine an imagination back-on switch for you, and so you know, if there's anything dainty inside my imagination, I'm gonna be mad. Imagination... go...  What the stuff? Well... this isn't so bad.  Nothing lame, at least. Hey! And there's Jake's imagination switch!
Cram. Oh! Maybe I can try imagining something.  Now for that switch.
No! How'd you get in my Imagination Land?!
REPRESENT THIS!  And this.
Haha... Penguins... Hahahaha! Heh, alright.  I hope this works, Jake!  Haha, yeah!  Hey! Get away from that! Don't push that hyper drive button!
Take a hike, fairy! Normal style!
You okay?
I don't know, dude. I think we got all the adventure we need right here...  with... lava on the floor!
Hahahaha! Good dog.Good morning, Princess!
I am sorry, Princess!
Since I got out of my last relationship, I've been slackin' on the job. So I'm rededicating my life to protecting, serving, and meeting your every need. Jake said I was acting bananas about the whole thing and wanted no part of this.
That's right, Princess. I'm gettin' back on the job hardcore, giving 100% of my being all for you.
No need to thank me, PB. It's my job.
Heh.
How am I doin' my job, Princess? Am I crushin' it?
Oh!
Buh-buh-buh! I got it!  Hyah!
Milk... You wanted milk...
Yes, I do regret the slow return, but I assure you, this is the highest quality milk available. It's mink's milk. I milked a mink. 100% dedication, no limits for what I do for you. I'd throw Peppermint Butler off this balcony if you ask.  Sorry, Peppermint Butler, just joking, but kinda sorta not.
Okay, I'll just rest here.
Yes, Princess.
Princess, I give my life to you girl, you are the best dang princess in the whole wide world.  Wow, PB, sure is a nice day to be outside!  Hey, watch what you say about PB, bro. Talk garbage about PB one more time, bro. See what happens!  Hold on one sec, PB. I gotta deal with a real tough guy over here.  You got one last chance to apologize before I dishonor you like you did my lady! Alright, bro, have it your way! Yah!  Where's your pants bro? Where's your honor now? Everyone's laughing at your undies! It's real uncomfortable! Wants some!  Wowzers!  No!  Did you drop this car on my lady, bro?!
You dropped a car on my lady, bro. Now I gotta restore her honor. I hope you're wearing underwear.  Whoa, dude's got awesome powers.  Hey, dude, you got awesome powers!  You gonna kill me, bro?
Do it! I ain't a baby!  Do it, bro!
What?! You're just gonna tell me I'm terrible and walk away? Teach me sword stuff, man!
I brought you a muffin.
Look, I know you don't know me and we got off on the wrong foot, but please, dude, teach me how to use the sword. Please!  You okay?
Oh, here.
Yeah, perhaps you feel a sense of indebted obligation to me?
Yut!  Ha, got one!
Yeah! That's right! I can take it!
Secret technique!
What the?!
So, am I a master swordsman now?
Oh. So, uh, why you livin' in this dump? You should be out in the world, saving fancy ladies and junk.
Oh, sorry!
He asked me not to tell you, but I cannot break my oath to serve you, my lady, 100%.
Sorry Ree-B-Z. My oath to the princess comes first, but once you two talk it out, I know she'll see you mean no harm.
Wait!
RB, don't!
No, Princess, look! They're only bruised!What's wrong with you, man?
I didn't bring any candy.
Nothing tastes right today. Like, I thought we were going to get into some serious flavor with these sand people, but they're just standing around like garnish.
Um...  nothing.  Wait, there she goes!
Yea-uh. The Spoon of Prosperity!
We've gotta get this spoon to Princess Bubblegum first.
Beats me.
Quit messing around, Jake.
Whoa!
I'm not sure that's a good idea
Whoa!
You also sealed our exit.
You'll bury us alive!
Finn to PB. Come in, PB.
Princess, we're trapped in the underground city.
Huh? No, we need help!
Guess we lost the signal.
Calm down, Marceline. There's gotta be some red stuff in these ruins. I'll go explore. You guys hang out here and save your energy.
Be cool.
Red, red, red. I guess even a vampire queen's face would melt off if she tried to eat lava.
Okay, here we go. Yeah, look at that!  Something crazy red behind this door. Hmm.  Why are y'all holding this door shut? You don't look like sand peeps, neither. More like wisemen-zerts . Oh, well. Gotta feed the Marcy monster.  'Scuse me. Up, sorry. Okay. Uhh... hi-yah!  Oh, dag.
Cool... What the heck happened here?  Whoop!  Ew. Whoops. Y'alls got turned into sand people. Don't go in the light. Go like this.  Around it. Next time, you guys. Hmm...  Whatever's down there's gotta have red blasting out of every hole. Hey, you're not still alive, right?
Okay. I was just making sure.  Bet that guy was a creep.  This hole is deep.
Maybe I should go back. Well, I've already gone this far.  Shebang! That oughtta be enough red to un...  Oops.
You mean the guy with the big thing on his head?
Naw. Paris is, like, super dead.
Dude, like, a really long time. Like five hundred years.
What the heck were you two doing?
Hm, that's dumb.
Can I have this big ol' ruby, then?
Clearly it's a big ol' ruby.
I would like the ruby.
Peace. Hyup!    Whoops.
Bleh. The trick is rollin' it. Phew! Check out this ruby I got.
You too now?! Emeralds are green, boyee.
Why is everybody messin' with me? It's like a dark gray-ish red. Mostly gray. Sometimes red things are gray!
Oh... whoops.
Uh, what's goin' on with Marcy?
Chill, man!
Nay-nay, brah!
Bubblegum?
Are you alright, PB?
Yeah, here you go.Gunther?  Uhhh...  Jake? We gots penguins.
Come on, you guys! Get off me, now.  Wah! Wah! Grah!
Jake?
Glip... driggle!
I don't know! I'm guessing it's the Ice King.
ICE KIIIIING!
What's goin' on here, man? Call off your super bros.
Where's the Ice King, Gunther?  Gunther?! What? Alright.  Whoa!
Is this happening everywhere?
What do ya see?
What, dude?!
Tell me!
Who's been conquered?
By the Ice King?
Holy shmow! Gimme that!  Gunther's heading for the Candy Kingdom! We gotta save them!
Hurry, Jake! WaitI'm still in my pajayjays.
Yeah, it's Gunther! He's taking over the whole thing!
He says your plan is bunk.
I got a plan.
When we get there, I'll do my plan in addition to your plan. Two plans. Laters.
I'm outies!
No, I gotta be mysterious.
I'm not. But this is how I act now with all the ladies, you see? I keep 'em in a state of confusion. That way, I've always got options in case Flame Princess doesn't work out.
It's called future farming. I read it in that book you have by Jay T. Doggzone.
Oh, okay. I'll stop it, then.
What? Now I'm confused.
Hey P-Bubs! Are you ready?
Cool. I'm gonna rally some citizens and do this other plan.
Good luck!
This... is my plan. I got the Candy Kingdom underground to help me collect all the bottles in the land.
I won't let that happen, Prubbs.
Stay back!
Peeb! There aren't any bottles left!
What, like, forever?
Bubb, your plan... bunks.
He wants to smash the Gumball Guardian's head!
Yeah, and why are you all jacked up?Oh. Heh heh. What? Where are we?
What did we do last night?
Eh, I doubt it. Yo, do you see this? We're in a cage! Do you think we, like, did something wrong?
Who ya calling?
What?
Play it for the clues within.
Did you take it yet?
Okay, get a shot of the portal.
Gonna go through this biz!
Oh, no! What?!
Dude, do you remember any of that mess?
So we opened a portal to somewhere, but where?
Are you sure?
Marceline's dad! We really are in the Nightosphere!
Whoa, wait. You're letting us go?
So what?
Hey, c'mon! Just tell us how we can get back to our world.
Well, dude, how do we talk to him?
Yeah, but we don't even know why we're here!
Maybe this is where they put all the dummy demons.  Right, big guy? You're not so smart, right? Yeah...  Let's go out that hole, man.
Mm-hm, mm-hm. Pretty neat.
Whoa, look!
What is that?
Cool.
Alright, well, how about that dude?
Yo, bros! How do we talk to Hunson Abadeer?
Bye, mister!  Who's the teller? That guy?
Hey, guy, are you the teller?
No, man, are you for real? How long's the wait?!
Bunk that!
Why do we need to see the teller anyway? We just wanna see Hunson Abadeer and find out what happened to us!
Where's the line start?
Excuse me! Excuse me! Big man? Over here!
Uh, yeah, how long have you been in line for?
Oh, butt traps. Jake, stretch us to the front.
All right, dudes, chill! We'll wait!
I can't feel my legs.
SAY SOMETHING!! Say something to me!!!
Just make up words then!
Yo, yo! We wanna talk to Abadeer!
42 million?! What's the number on the door?
That's us!
I'm gonna lose it! Waaaaaaaaaaahhh...
I guess.
I don't know if my little boy heart can take it.
Mm-hmm.
Ok.
Well, at least I can see the end of the line, I think. Let's wait the heck out of this line!
I'm super pumped!
Oh, yeah, we've got questions.
No way, dude, I got questions.
What the hey, Jake!
Hey, bloodmist cloud! What happened to us? Why can't we remember any? Oh, it's gone.
Hey, cloud! Where's Abadeer? Whoa, look at all these paintings. I think this is Hunson Abadeer's house.
Hunson Abadeer!
Yeah, why'd you lock us up, Abadeer? When Marceline finds out about this, it's gonna stir up some heavy daddy-daughter issues.
Oh, my lob, Jake! You found the portal!
What the?
But Marcy, let us help you!
Marceline's in trouble! We gotta go back and save her.Hey, fart-face!!
Unhand Princess Bubblegum!!
Whoa!  Ah!
Hey, Ice King! I bet you'll never kiss the princess!
You just kissed Jake's butt!
You're welcome, Princess.  Uh...
I just thought I'd bring 'er a gift... in return for throwing us this party.
What?
What?!
That's ridiculous!  Huh? Uggghhh!!  What's so funny?
What's everyone laughing at?
Who is that guy?
Princess Bubblegum!  Princess. I just wanted to thank you for
Uhhh...
Why didn't the princess invite me to dance?
But now she's dancing with him! Ah... I feel... weird!
BLAAAARGH!!
Agh!  They're talkin' about science, man! I can't compete with that!
You think that'll work?
Science Dance! Science Dance!
Science Dance! Hey, eh, Princess! You wanna spend some time with me?
Oh... I'm... into Zanoits! Th-They're the best!
Oh, no, not the Plantoids!
...So are Zanoits... good things?
No, I'm not. I just don't like the way he talks to you. It makes me feel weird.
I'm not jealous! I'M WEIRD!!!
Agh... I don't know! I was tryin' to warn 'er, but she twisted my words around and
I know! And I can't shake this weird feeling about Ricardio. I think he's... a villain.
No! I can just feel it in my gut! He's up to something sinister!
I'll prove he's a villain!
Stakeout.
Here he comes!  They're talking!
Get serious, Jake!! This is life and death!
I gotta trust my gut!
He's on the move! Let's roll!  I see 'im. He's holding rope and going into the trash. He's smashing bottlesand pretending to stab someone!
I think your gut's a little naive, Jake.  Holy moly! He's... he's with the Ice King! They're shouting something!  Ricardio is tossing him in the dumpster and running away!
No way. This proves he's a super-villain! More powerful than lesser villains like the Ice King!
Then it's settled! We're gonna confront Ricardio face-to-face and prove he's evil!
So what're you doin', Ricardio? Are you evil?
The safety of Princess Bubblegum is my business!
You stay away from Princess Bubblegum with all that stuff!
I could stop you if I wanted!
Yeah!
YEEEAAAH!!!
Princess?!
He was gonna hurt you with those ropes and bottles!
But...
She hates me now. I was totally wrong about Ricardio.
Ice King! What do you know about this? Tell me or I'll do something!
I don't care! I only care about Ricardio!
Agh! Come on, Jake!  Gotta save the princess!
Princess!!
Not if I can help it!
Why don't you marry someone your own size?! Like my foot?!
And my fist?!
Ice King.  Should we... let 'im take his heart back? He is... villainous...
No, she won't!
Don't mention it.
I never get jealous.
NOOOOOOOO!!!Tickle, tickle, tickle.
See? I told you, it's candy stucco. Stucco feels great.
Yeah, we were doing that... thing.
But we're each other's witnesses.
Look, man, you didn't see nothing.
Well, guys. It looks like you caught us.
Okay, Princess, you can come out now.Me too
Last night when I saw you writing yours.
Bringeth it on, sir!
Whoever talks first will be really disappointed
Yes, but only the ones we write in the next thirty seconds
Hi, Jake
Thanks, Jake, That's funny, Jake, Nice catch, Jake, Go get'm Jake!  You the man, Jake!   I love you, Jake.
Of course not, man.
Jake, what are you implying? That I would touch your signs after being expressly forbidden to do so?.
Jake rules!,   What're we gonna do...  about BMO?
What?
Oh, I win!  you're so disappointed.
We were just playing a game, BMO. It all started this morning when Jake made a sign that said-Hm!  Whoa!
Marceline, why did you ask ancient chumps to play basketball?
Lay it on us!
Whoa, mamaMm-hmm.
Oh, sick!
Dude, how do you fight a snail?!
We are heroes. We thought you were trying to attack us. Why'd you break in here all mad, squirting that juice all over us?
Stop squirting slime! Just tell us what's wrong!
Jake, hero huddle.  What do you think?
Yeah, but he's just an innocent goober looking for love.
Right! All right, man. We'll help you hook up as long as you
All right! all right! We'll help you, dude! Just put our house back!
Aw! All right, you big crazy. It's a deal.
Jake, what time is it?!
Okay, Snorlock, if you want a lady, you have to be yourself.
Uh, how does he be himself, Jake?
Ummm... Baaaaaam!
Yeah.
Dude! our house! We got to do something!
Break it up, you two! We have ladies to attend to!
Ugh! gross, Jake!
Okay. I'll do it for this guy.
What's up, lady snail?
No! I can't do this, man! I-am-out!
Uh... WHA!
Okay! Yes!
Uhh.
Yah! yah! yah! yah! Yaaaah! hyah!
Whoo-hoo!
Jake, these chicks look pretty serious.
Uh, he's bringing in a lot of ladies.
Snorlock! These ladies are ruining our tree house! Stop!
How are we gonna get our house back?
Wha? Jake! No! You'll get slimed or grinded on!
Yeah, man. That's why you have trouble with snail chicks. You need slug chicks.
That's gross!
I don't know. Come on, let's finish rebuilding it. I got some ear plugs you can borrow.
Where's that music coming from?
BMO! Get over here and help us rebuild the tree house.Hey Princess Bubblegum, when we bring the dead back to life, will it be filled with worms?
Old Mr. Cream Puff?
Something's happening! Come on, come on...
Algebraic!
Hey, look, the decorpsinator serum is working!
You're grounded, Mister.
Why?
Chew on this!
Get a life!
Alright, you heard the princess, everyone in! Alright, no pushing, come on!
The princess will explain everything. Tree Trunks, get those hot buns in here, girl.
Did we get everyone?
Thanks, Manfried.
What?!
Wait! What about the zom--?!
But, Princess, the Undead--
Wha?!
What do you mean flip out?
Candy People explode when they get scared?!
Okay, sure.
Yes,  I Royal Promise.
Yes, your highness.
No, wait. Can I at least tell  Jake?
You know, about the outbreak of zom--
Uhh, nothing at all, buddy!
Ahha ah, what? No, no way.
Who wants to play Truth or Dare?
Ok, Chocoberry, you may ask someone to tell a deep truth or a saucy dare.
Yep! Fine! Everything is great! Heh, heh.  Except for that. Whoa.
Dare! Haha!
Umm, ahh, the truth is, ahhh...
Ahhh... the truth is... that I'd rather play Dodge Socks!
Hey, give me my sock back! Dodge Socks was a bad idea!
Oh, my goodness! Princess hasn't finished the equation and the zombies are here!
I, uh, she just want this slumber party to be super fun, and if I did have something to tell you, then I would in a second, and it would make my life easier, unless there was something stopping me, like a promise, but there isn't, so I won't, so it's cool.
Umm... Hey, you know what time it is?
No, time for Seven Minutes in Heaven! You're first.
Lady Raincorn! In the closet with Jake!
I can't hear you all the way in heaven!
What? Hear what? I, I don't hear anything.
What? No, Chet. Everybody, wait. What noise? You mean this noise?
Yeah! Dance it! Bust it up! Uh! Uh! Uh! Oh!
Uhh, it's... Blockado. Haha, the game of barricades. Come on, let's block all the entrances and windows!
Alright, this is not a permanent solution. Think Finn, how can you keep everyone from finding out?
Manfried, the talking pinata! Your convient appearance gives me a great idea. Everyone, grab a stick! New game! We're gonna smash some pinatas!
Except for you, Manfried.
Now everybody don these blindfolds.  Thanks, Taffy Girl.
Alright, everybody, get together. I'm hanging the pinatas...  They're all around you. Smash the pinatas!
Yeah! You guys are on fire!
Yes! We did it! My improbable plan worked!
Oh, we killed all the zombies that Princess Bubblegum and I raised from the dead.
Jake? What's going on?
Yeah, but, I mean, all the zombies are dead. The Candy People won't freak out. What's the big deal?
That's stupid.
Mathematical!
Awww.
Uhh....
Uhh. Four, right?
What's happening, Princess?
Slamacow! That was tops! Who's not good at math? I was all Four!
You're welcome!
Woohoo! Yeah!
Heck yeah! If I break a Royal Promise, I get to fight zombies, throw slumber parties, awake Gumball Guardians and... and...
And reverse death itself!
I will, Princess.
Starchie, you're not a zombie.
You're delicious!But he sacrificed himself to do it.
Blaze his face, Eli!
Okay!
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
Oh, uh!  Aah!
Hi.
I'll make the guaaaaaaaaaaac.
Yo! What's up, APTWE?
Dude, I don't know. Probably not go back in the basement. You're so big'uns. You should be free, boy.
Can you help me dice tomatoes for this guac?
You see, man, I feel weird giving you orders. You should just do your own thing. Realize your potential.
No, man. You're more than that.  Whoops. I see into your brain, remember? You'll do great. Just go for it. I believe in you, man.
Oh, word. Thanks.
Don't think like that, dude! Come back and see us whenevs!I wasn't...
Huh. Oh, yeah! Cool.
Hey...
That's not-
Magic Man! Get UP!
Hee-yup-hoop! They took my friend to Mars! Fly me there and help me save him!
What do you mean, KILL?
SQUEEZE!!!!
You succubutt!
How long have you had this house?
Well, I bet there's something in here that could help me save Jake.
What?! Where is it?
Yeah, what's the deal? This place is wrecked. Eeeew, ew! What am I stepping in??
Ugh!
Magic Man, what is your deal for real?
Well, for one, I think this house is a reflection of your sick brain.  Look at this. Yuk. Who's this you're standing with in this picture?
...all right.  Well, I'm gonna keep digging through this stuff til
What?
Holy crepes.
This can take me to Mars?!
How does it work?
But... It has to work. It has to.  For Jake.
YAAAH!  WHOOOOOOAAA!!!
Stop!
Aw, man.  Force field.
Oh snap.
Yeah that's ME, you dishrags!
Jakey! No!
I don't care none for that mess. This wouldn't have globbed if you'd just...listened to my bro! You bunked up, King of Mars! The wisest, most honest super being of all time just put an innocent dog to deads!
Yay! King of Mars saved you!
Oh, man. Should we go get Magic Man?
EAT MY SKIDS!  YAAAAH!
MAGIC MAN!
Go! Get out of here, tiny manticore!
Jeez. What?
What's he saying?Wha?! Jake, I told you to stop staring at me right at the time when I wake up.
I can't move either.
What? What was that? Who goes there?
Jake, use your peripheral vision!
What did you do to us, Ice King?
Freezing Potion A.
Unfreezing Potion A?
Yeah, 'cause we're already friends.
Uh, yellow? Orange? Blueno, no, lavender! Lavender! Yeah!
How did you?
You lock your bottles?
Jake, look!
No, Gunter, no!
No, Gunter! No!
Gunter, stop!
When someone loses one sense, their other senses are enhancedlike a blind man who can smell and hear really well. I'm gonna try using my now-enhanced brain sense to make contact with an Astral Beast who will help us.
Whee! Haha! Whee! Astral Beast, come to me!
Come to me, Astral Beast...
Astral Beast! Where are you? You come here NOW!  Wheee...!
Astral Beast! WHERE ARE YOU? Show yourself! Why not? Does this dance please you, Astral Beast?  Does this please you?!
THIS IS IIIIT!
The Astral Beast cometh.
Yup. I just got back from the Astral Plane!
It's on its way. It's gonna be awesome.
Uh, I'm not sure. I couldn't see it in the Astral Plane. But I heard it. It sounded really intense.  Maybe a gorilla?
Aw, junk! Did I summon butterflies?!  I'm the worst.
Yeah, I am.
...at being the worst.
What are you doing?
Oh. That's cool. I deserve it.
What do we wa? We want you to unfreeze us, you lunatic!
Friends don't eat each other, Ice King. That's not how friends work. Now unlock this bottle and unfreeze us.I'll get your blanket dude, where is it?
Why don't you just get it yourself?
Poor guy...
Oh man, Jake, is there anything I can do to make you feel better?
Soup-flavored cure coming on through.
Do you feel better now?
Once upon a time...
But you've all ready heard all of my stories before.
Okay... got it! Once upon a time...
What's the matter?
Hmm. Now you hang on, my friend. I'll be right back.  Okay, world, give me a story for Jake!  Huh!  Jake, Jake! Check it out! This true story is going to totally cure you!
First, the leaf fell off a tree. But wa-w-w-wait.
The snail was on the leaf. The end.
But I don't know how to make that stuff happen!
I am not gonna let that happen, dude.
I'll be back as fast as a can. I won't let your guts blow outta your face.  Hmm. Romance. That should be easy.
Hey, how 'bout you two. Are y'all in love?
Uh...
Umm.  Are y'all kissing in there?
Hmm. Maybe I should smooooth out my approach a bit. Normal guy, forest guy. Just like normal forest guy.  Whoa! . Hey, so, uh, yeah... so, yeah, can I, umm... can I watch you guys kissing?
I just need to for my friend! He's really sick and unless I tell him about watching you guys kissing and...
Jake! His name's Jake.
Wait! I'll do anything!
I would for Jake!  Okay, now you guys kiss.
What! No! Jake needs this! Stop!  Just come on!
You see, no big deal.
Okay, sweet!
Ugh!  That wasn't smooth, but it's all worth it to save Jake. Whatever it takes. Okay, a good fight...  Hey, you want to fight me?
He's probably not dead. I'm sorry though, that you think he's dead. Mmm, I don't want to hurt aminals, but - but Jake -  Okay, what's next?  Ohhhhhhhhhh, suspense...
Hey you guys, you wanna die?
No!  Awwwwww, I can't do it! I keep messing with folks, aaaaaaaahh!!!  Jake needs me, but I can't keep messing with folks, but Jake's really sick, but I can't but, but, but, but...uhhh!!!    Oww, hey, who threw -- ahhhhhhhhh!!!!  Wait, what's happening, are you guys gonna eat me?!
Hey, wait, this is really suspenseful!
What is this?
Don't I get a trial or something?!
I'm totes gonna die... and now Jake won't get his story and he'll die too... because I still don't have a happy ending... huh??
Wait a minute! I may be busy dying... but you need to get busy living...
Y'all living some unhappy lives. You, Boobafina...
You love Mr. Goose. You just need to tell him.
She loves you... y'all just need to hook it up.
And you Mr. Fox, you need to face facts man. Boobafina is not interested. It's time to move on.
And hey, jerky teenage bear!
Your mom is right. You shouldn't just go around fighting strangers in the forest.
Momma bear, your son's not a baby anymore. You should stop spanking him in the face.
Yeah! That's the stuff!
And Mrs. Cow, take that bag off your udder. You're beautiful, girl. You live in the forest, so why don't you just let it hang out?
What?!
Does that mean you're going to release me?
Cool!  Yeah! I'm coming for you, Jake... with a story!!!
And then everyone in the forest was happy... The end.
What's wrong?!
Really?
Ha ha! Neat.
Nah, I'm good.
No, I just feel bad.
Yeah, I think so....'Cause those trees were evil... right, Princess Bubblegum?
Um... not really. I've never even met any other humans. If I think about it too much, I get all soul-searchy and weeeeiiirrrd...
Okay... I guess so...
SPA-MOW!!
Huck!
Huh?  It's a hatch.
Heh-heh.  S'dark, huh?  Whooooooaaaaaa!
Huh?!
These people are so terrified... Scared of their own shadows...
Don't be scared, c'mon.  Yeah, it's okay.  Your... your face! You're...  JUST LIKE ME!!  Hey, wait!
I don't think they're animals, Jake. I think... this could be... a tribe of... humans!!  What are these guys doing down here in this crummy hole?
Hey, fellows! Don't you wanna get out of here?! I could take you to see the sun!  Suuuun. Suuuun.
You poor things... Living down here has made you all weird, hasn't it?  Jake, I've got to save these guys! They're my people, and it's my duty to lead them outta this gross cave! Starting with you, Miss, uh...
...Susan?  Pleased to meet you!
C'mon.
Aw, man, you're gonna love it up here, Susan!
There's all sorts of wonders top-side!
Susan, it's just grass.
Grass can't hurt you.  See?
Wha?! I did?!
Aw, Susan... You got grass blood all over your face.
Susan... a hankie won't hurt you.
How'm I supposed to show 'er the wonders of Ooo if every little thing freaks her out?
Very well. Then I shall introduce Susan to Ooo... by degrees!
That can't hurt you! That's a dancing bug!  Yeah! Hahaha!
What's wrong?!  Hey, hey, hey, it's okay!  See?
Hey, Jake, how's your marshmallow, man?
Hmmm...  Perfect!  How's yours, Susan?
Hey, yeah! Susan! We should take you to the Candy Kingdom! Everything is candy there!
Nah...
Yeah, Suze?
Oh, well, it's... everywhere! The buildings, the lamp posts, even the people!
Susan!  Susan!! No! You can't eat the ones that talk! They're special! They got aspirations.
It's okay. You're learnin'. Here.  Have some sidewalk brittle instead.
What?!
Susan, no!!  No!!! You can't eat the Candy People!!  Oh, boy...
No, man! They're my peeps! We have to save the Candy Kingdom without hurting them.
Don't worry! We have a plan! We just have to scare the humans away!
But how?!
Quick! Show me your scary face!!
NO DUH! She's...um...! She's...  Hey! Princess. I need a little wagon and your biggest roll of wax paper.
Now, Princess Bubblegum!  Now, Jake!  It's working...
Aw, man! They've learned how to learn! Hide yourselves, Candy People! I'll try to make Susan see reason!
Please, fellow humans! The Candy People are no threat to you!
WAIT!! STOP!!
MY PEOPLE!!  HUH?!?!  WHA?!?  They're... they're not humans?  Susan?  Susan... what are you??
Is everyone okay?  Marshmallow Kids?
Jake, do you think she was human, or just another wild animal?
Yeah... I guess we are... brother.Ice King, this the last time you steal our sandwiches!
Yeah, and if you were us, you'd kick your fat butt!
Yaah!
Got you now!
Jake, do you think that puddle needs our help?
I thought Snow Golems and Fire Wolves hated each other.
But they learned to get along.Hey, Abracadaniel's here, with a bus full of lame wizards.Hour six of our Ice Kingdom stakeout. Abso-nothing's going on there.
Pfff. You sure this tip is good, Flambo?
Hmm.
Whoa, nowninjas are real. For you see,  Doo, doo, doo... Jake and I are ninjas.
Listen!
It's the Ice King, all right, and he's looking awful pleased with himself.
Then we gotta...
...we gotta save that princess.
Ninja kick!
Princess? Princess!
Princess!
No princess?  It's... a trap! We're being trapped! Ninja vanish! Evade! Evade!
Are you sure?
Wait, man. I-I feel uncomfortable snooping through Ice King's personal stuff. It feels sorta like...  a violation.
No, no, no, no, no! We can't read his private junk!
There's our proof, man! ... Hmm, alright. Let's use our ninja stealth and hide until he comes back with the princess.
No.  Alls we're gonna do is lie in wait until the Ice King gets back. ThenBOOM we catch him with princess on his hands.
In this filthy hamper!  Think he's there yet?
See anything?
But we're ninjas! And this is our ninja hideout.
Wait!
Jake! Get back here!   Hey, wait up!
Weird.
Hey!  We gotta leave no trace! Ninjas leave no trace!
Hey, come on!
Jake, what have we done?
Dude! Leave no trace!
It's not too  ...late. WHOA!
Dude! It's a first-edition Ice Ninja Manual!
A true ninja passes no wind; he only passes...
Hey. Ice King seems way into ninjas, even more than we are.
So... doesn't that mean that ninjas must be... kinda lame?
Jake! Show me how to do that.
Fridjitsu master Finn summons... dagger of chilled glass.
Get ready to be... cold cut!
Kunai attack!
Force of blizzard!
What?! Three Jakes? That's one too many. Caltrop hailstorm!  Those Jakes were all fakes!
Hiyah!  Rad.
It's the Ice King! Hide!
He's got a princess. Now we leap out and catch him red-handed.
Snow blind!
Ice King, hand over that princess!
Jake, where's the princess?
The, um... princess you were just talking to?
Ohh...
No princess?
We messed up, Jake. We're... violators!
We're... ninjas?
It's true.  Ice King, we're gonna make this right.
Doctor Princess!
What's goin' on?Let me check the spooky invite sent to us by our anonymous host.  Oh. We're here. The party's in that castle.
It's for us!
Wear me.
Hello?
Princess Bubblegum, is that you?
Prince Hotbod, at your service.
So... who's our host, anyway?
Here. Let me.
Esteemed guests, I am your host. I am a ghost.
By the time you finish reading this, I will posses one of you and use your body to murder everyone in the house.
CB, wait! It says anyone who will try to leave will die!
Whad'ya mean Yeaaaah, right?
Dude.  I swear I'm not pranking you. Cinnamon Bun is dead.
The question is: who killed him?
One of us is possessed by a murderer. And if we want to stay alive, we have to figure out who's hiding a ghost inside their mortal body.
BMO!
Use your ghost detecting equipment to screen everyone.
Did you see that?
Huh?
Good idea! Jake and BMO, you check downstairs and we'll take this floor.
Where's BMO?
Don't you mean you got 'im-  Ghost!
No.
Uh-huh.  Let me remind y'all that the invite says that the ghost will possess one of our bods.
That's right,  Jake.
So let me ask you a question only the real Jake could answer. Who is always next to me in my recurring elevator dreams?
Okay, you're Jake. So, who else was absent when BMO got nabbed?
A convenient alibi. But tell me this...
Sounds suspicious.  I bet you're the ghost!
Oh she is, huh? Well, before we tie up LSP, answer me this...
But answer me this, Princess...
What did I write to you on your Happy Birthday card two years ago? Word for word.
I remember that.
A real ghost?!
This wasn't supposed to... ha-a-appen!
Yeah... it was all a set up. The doors, Cinnamon Bun's and BMO's. Oh strizz! BMO and Cinnamon Bun should be in the closet over there.  Guys! Guys, guys! C'mon you guuuu-.
LSP! What's happening!
Where'd did she GO?!
Open it!
C'mon!
Jake!
Jakey!
Oh no! Your fancy GLOVES!
Jake... Princess!
YEEAAARGH!
WHAT!?
So everyone's okay.  BMO, Cinnamon Bun...
Whoa, sick! You can phase people into your body?!
But, PB. You melted!
Wow, you got me again! I can't believe that! With the hair, and the house coming alive and stuff...
The walls and chairs trying to eat me and stuff.
Uh, no I didn't...
That one's going in the vault.  Aaaaand... It's gone.Throw it!
What the heck is goin' on?
Yeah. Hey, look.  This one looks stupid. Let's see how it flies!  Aw, lame.
Oh no! She thinks that nuts guy did it. We gotta go clear up what happened!
Princess!  Are you OK?
Uh... hey, Princess. There's something I should tell you about that bottle that hit you in the face.
Yeah but-
Forever?
Jake!
What do I do? If I tell her I threw it, she'll hate me forever!
But we're the ones who threw the bottle!
How do you know that?
Maybe you're right.
Alright, just this once, we'll be vigilantes!
Princess! I won't rest until the villainous duke is captured!
Woah. Okay, and by then, hopefully you'll have taken care of...this.
Look yonder! The Duke of Nuts castle!
Duke of Nuts!
By order of Princess...
Um, Princess...
How did you know?
Yeah, why?
That won't be...um...necessary.
I don't get it, Jake. How can the dude be evil if he pets puppies, kisses babies, and lies with his wife?
Hmm.   It's him! The Duke of Nuts!
I'll break left! You take the right!
Wha-?  You're way smaller than I thought you were!
Man, I don't know, Jake. Why would Princess Bubblegum hate him if he's such a nice guy?
That doesn't look like a villain.
Ugh! Maybe we should just confess. But then, Princess Bubblegum will hate us forever.
Actually yeah, I think I have one in my pack.
I think I have a spoon in here too- wha-?
What?!
So that's why Princess Bubblegum hates you!
Gah! Of course you wouldn't! You're too nice a guy. I'm the one who threw that bottle. I was gonna tell her, but then-- she started talking all crazy-- she said she'd never forgive me and I-- I didn't know!
Now you're making me feel even worse by being so nice about it.
Wait...I think I might have an idea that will save everyone's reputations.
Halt!
Not yet, but you are in grave danger, Princess. There is an assassin in these very woods, dead set on stopping you from reaching the Grand Meeting. In fact, what's that rustling in the bush??
What's going on?!
What are you here to do, stranger?
Stand back! I will stop him! Hi-yah!
Hi-yaah!
Remember, it's just acting, Jake!
Yeah!
Oh, no!
No!
The duke didn't throw that bottle! Ahh- Princess, I have something sucky to confess. I'm the one who threw the bottle.  I'm sorry, but I knew if I told you, you'd hate me forever!
I don't even know what that means, but thank you!
Yeah, what's up with that hate?
Aw, shucks. He just can't control himself around pudding. He goes cocoa-nuts for it! Because he has a pudding deficiency!
I'm really sorry about making you temporarily ugly, Princess. Especially before the Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty. I wish there was some way to make it up to you.
Hmm, what? You said maybe.
Ahem! It would be presumptuous indeed to present myself against the distinguished princess to whom you have listened.Candy Party! Jake! This party is so crazy!
Princess Bubblegum's in trouble!
Cool.
Uhh... What'd you think of?
No way!
A magical globe?
Golly!
Yeah, I see it!
Shmow-zow!
Do you think I've got the goods, Bubblegum? 'Cause I am in to this stuff!
Then off I go!
Jaaaaaaaaake!
Thanks, pal.
Bye, Princess!  You know what time it is, buddy?
Yeah, man!
I just thought you'd look cute stuffed in that lock.
Bye!
What?! Dude! You can't smell the book from here!
This way!
It can wait. Someone needs our help.
I'm fine! Keep going! We have to hurry!
I gotcha.
What?!
What?!
No! Wai...
Please...
Don't destroy...
Anymore...
Old women.
No way, dude. Those old ladies are destroyed because of me. I'm not righteous. I'm wrongteous. Stupidteous.
Illusions?
Maybe they're lost?
Hmmm... Hmmm!
Yeah! You're the smartest dog I know, man.
Jake? Jaaaaaaaake!
Gimme back my friend!
Let Jake go, or I'll...  I'll kick your foot!
Huh?  I'm coming, buddy!
I got your wallet, man!
Give me back my friend!
Fine.  I'll give you your dollar.  Here's your dollaaaaaarrrrr!
Jake!  You're okay!
Just a minute, Jake.
Thanks, Jake. Now sniff out that book for me.
Whoa!
Thank you.
Where... am I?
Why? Is it an evil beast?
Shoot, yeah. I'll slay anything that's evil. That's my deal.
Thank you.
Is it evil?
No!
Never. Never. Never!
Never!
Oh, no! Mr. Key-per! I-I'm sorry. Why are you wearing that little devil costume?
Are you another trial?
The manly minotaur from Princess Bubblegum's story!
So, can I check out the Enchiridion? Can I? Can I? Can I?
The Enchiridion!
Really?
Oh, yeah.  Whoa. How to Kiss Princesses?
It doesn't say anything, Princess.
Awwww... Yeah!Man, why am I so sleepy?
For real-sies?
Then we went to LSP's quinceanera.
We'll take care of it, Peppermint Butler.
We rescued Wildberry Princess from the Ice King.
I'm exhausted. But happy!
Good night!  That's right, Finn. Adventure 'til you drop.  Hey, Jake?
Can you sleep?
I can't sleep either.
I don't know. But, I've got the strangest feeling...that we're being watched.
Why is that horse staring at us?
That's super creepy.
Well, maybe he's gone.
Let's just close the shade.
Good work, Jake
Ahh! Why won't it stop?!
Maybe we can just...politely ask it to leave.
Whoa, man! Let me try, diplomat style.  Pardon me horse, I beseech thou to split from mine land, this night. But I welcome thee to come back for some luncheth, some other day. Okay?
Okay, you're right. We can try pushing it, now.
Move, horsey! Good Grod, Jake! Are you even pulling?!
This horse has a ridiculous weight!
Math this. What now, man.
You shouldn't creep us out from way over there!
Oh yeah, I'm so ready for bed.
Me too!
Where are you going?!
Look, man.
Jake! That horse is whack with poo-brain.
Dude, poo-brain means we can lure it away from here using music.  Everything brainless likes music.
Jake? It's not luring!
Huh?!
Ha!
Stop! You're luring snakes! STOP!!
Stop man!
What?!
No, man, we're not killing the horse.
Wah?!
No, man! That is wrong.
Whoa. That sounds awesome.
It looks like a bunny?
Hey Jake, I think I see a hawk or two.  Cause more commotion to help the hawks!
Hey, there they are! They see our commotions!
The bunny! The bunny!
What a beautiful sight.
Good night, buddy.
Ahh! It's in our house now!
Hey, this is all your fault, dude! If you weren't so darn handsome, animals wouldn't always be staring at you!
I told you to lure the horse! You lured the snakes! There's even one here in my underpants!  Wait a minute, dude. Can't you see what this horse is doing?  It's tearing us apart.
I know, bro. I know.
What?! Dude, you've lost it!
You're right! It's about time I show this horse who's the man.
Say that to me again.
Do... Doo-doo. I'm going to kick that horse in the bottom!
You were spying on us?!
Were you?
Thank you.
Jake! Jake! Look out!
Snakes!
What's he doing?
Yeeesss!
We don't need any more.
Guests bring their own ice.
Tell us why you're watchin' us or we'll - we'll cut off your stupid head.
What?Finn to Prubs, come in, Prubs.
So far, no sign of the Bird Man. Why's this guy so dangerous?
Where are you?
Maybe I'll go hang out with them after this biz.
Okay. Bye, PB.
Whoa.
Huh? Where am I?
So are you, like, the Great Bird Man?
Whoa. What happened there?
What are you doing?
Oh, uh, me and Jake will follow you. Jake needs to stretch out and stuff.
It's crazy, right?! The way dude's eyeballs are just hangin' there.
Yeah, me too!
I don't know. But if he does, I'm gonna find out.
Now's our chance to do some snooping.
Jake!  I found his weapon stash!
What is it? A fighting stick? A dagger?
You can read those bumps with your fingers?
Your ex was blind?
Maybe. Let's keep looking.
Doy!
Oh!
Wha?
Where'd you learn that heal spell?
Dirt?
Listen, man. About your eyes.
Alright, but not
Dude, he's changed!
Uh, yeah, man. Isn't it kind of obvi?
Dude, your eyes are in your beard.
No, man, they're right here.
We didn't tell you 'cause we thought you might still be a wong lord!
No, man.
How's it feel, man?
Yeah, sure, man.
That idea is terrible.
Come on, man. Are you for real?
Okay, man.
Dude, that sucks. I hope he finds peace, or something.
Should we save him?
What the?You getting all bit up by mosquitoes?
Man, I can't believe you said this was a good swimming hole.
True.
Yeah. This place smells like green beans.
Yeah, Woobeewoo! Of course we'll help. Why didn't you just say something before?
Oh. Right on. You good now?
Yeah, man! Me and Jake will bust this Mega Frog up, right up his bumble-stop.
Gettin' anything?
Word... Hey, I have an idea. We can use those lollipops to leave a trail. That way we won't get lost out here.
Like... electric celery?
Sweet. These'll take us right to him.  Come on, Jake!
Hmm. Huh. We've passed this butt tree, like, three times.
We should probably backtrack--get reoriented and all that.
Whoa. Yeah! Guess we better follow the lollipops back. Where's those at?
Snaaaap. Totally lost. Dang! Do you think maybe the Mega Frog made all those footprints on purpose? So we'd use up all our lollies and get totally lost?
Cool! I call fire patrol!
Yeah, man--it's easy.  Uhhh, rub 'em together, right?
I think I saw some guy do it like this once.
Yeah, here we go!
Friction!
Mwah!  I don't know.
Jake, how did you--?  What the--? It's the Mega Frog! Quick, put the fire out!
Jake, look!  He's just sittin' there! What's he doin' out there?
Okay, Sweetles.  What?
Hoi-YAAAH!
Wha--?  Jake, wake up. Look!
Look at that thing!
Yeaaaah! That's a great idea, man!  That's a great idea, Jake.
What? What is it, Jake?
Wha--?  AAAAAAAAAAAAHH!  Jake!  RUN!  Jake, stretch us outta here!  Come on, Jake!
Jake, let's hide in this cave.  Shmow-tow, dude! That guy's gonna dingle our bones into tapioca pudding!
Hmm? Hmmm...
Hmmm. That's it!  Jake, wait!
I know how to stop him!  Mwah!
You can't break your own curse by kissin' somebody. Somebody's gotta kiss you.
Whatevs.Baby!
I know what you need.
You want your little baby socks, for your little baby feet.
Baby!
I know what you crave.
You want to poop your pants all day long. Well, baby behave!
Remember when I swallowed that little computer?
Alright, Stanley. You and your family are safe... Again...
What the... Shmow-zow! Look at that!
Alright.  Baby! You lookin' so good. You lookin' like you might... want some baby food.
Baby! You lookin' so fine. You lookin' like you might... just start cryin'.
Dude! This guy... is a pal for life! It looks like he's got two jiggly bellies stuck together.
He's the Jiggler.
You are the best thing ever. Let's take the Jiggler back to the house and just stick him by our bed so we can wake up...
I gotta tuck you in, girl. I gotta sing you sweet melodies about babies. Yeah!
Welcome to your new home. Feast your eyes on... everything!
Splitting my toothbrush in half, so he can use half.
Here you go. It's for your teeth.
Like this.
Yeah! You got it.
Yeah! Toothbrush dance.  This is cool!
Yeah!
Dance... dance...  dance...  I'm not tired! How about you, Jake?
Maybe we should go upstairs.
You can have the comfiest spot on the bed. Goodnight.
Mornin', Jake!
Are you ready to get down?  Let's get this party started!
Where's the little guy?
Hey, pal. You ready to cut loose? Wake and shake, buddy. Let's do this thing!
What do you mean?
Aww... I bet he just needs some breakfast after a night of extraordinary jiggling. Hey! Let's combine everything we can find in the kitchen... and have the Jiggler drink it! That'll wake him up! And then we can... Get  doooowwwn!
Then let's just give him some, uh... purple whatevers.
Yeah. Whatever.
Hey! I think he's diggin' it!
Uhh...
Nah. He just doesn't like purple whatevers. What we need to do is figure out what he does like to eat.
Here, Jiggler. What kind of food do you like? Meat? Some banana? This looks like corn... I think. Uh... hot dog. Stanley the watermelon.
Look! Jake! He likes it!
Wow!
His favorite food... is drawings! Awesome!
I'm drawing a picture of you.
Come on. Eat him up, Jiggler!
Alright. Alright. I got it. Calm down... I'll eat it.  Ahhhhh.
Well... You gonna eat yourself, tough guy?
Ok. Alright. Now, let's get back to some jiggling!
Like this. Yeah! Woo! Come on Jiggler! wiggle and whistle!
Jiggler?
Uh... There's nothing wrong with him. We just gotta plug up his holes.
See? That worked. Ready to jiggle again, little guy?
Whoa!
Quick! We gotta plug those holes!
Jake, hurry!
What about your eyepatch collection?
Jake!
We can't just abandon him. Look at him, Jake. He needs us now more than ever.  Just need to take better care of you from now on, right little guy?
Jiggler!
Oh, holy moly! Don't worry, Jiggler. We'll fix you.
Let's gather him up, Jake. He's all over the place... even between the floorboards!
And the galoshes!
Come on. Let's put him back together.
Squeeze real hard. He's slipping!
No way! I won't let you die, guy! Not this time.
I'm kissing him! What do you think? It's all I could think to do.
He's kissing colors with his dying breath.
We took this child away from its mama, Jake. We're kidnappers and murderers! I just wanted to have fun and jiggle!
Then there's no time to spare.
Shhh. Just hold on a little longer, buddy.
Perpendicular! It's the mama!
Well. This is it, buddy.
Hey! Stop that!
I don't understand. That crazy mama almost killed him.
What are we supposed to do now, man? We can't bring him home, or he'll... or he'll...
Dang it! Why doesn't she love him? I love him!  You love him! It's not fair!  Ahhhh!
Mama's supposed to love baby! She's supposed to love baby!
It's yours, idiot!
Don't you recognize your own baby?
Alright. Ok.  I loved you, baby. I hope you know that.
Word to your motheeeerrrrr!
I'll never kidnap again.AHHHH!!!!!  Whoa!!!!!!!!
Yeah. That dang snail again, man... Muckin' it up again. But... there were other guys this time, too. The bear was there, and some dogs, and Billy's lady, and Billy... and Billy was real scared of somethin' fierce, man. Somethin' real fierce! ...And the Cosmic Owl was there, tookindascreechin' it up.
You think?
Dang... Whoa...
Hello?  Billy??
Oh, you know, just drop by to say hello... See what you been uhhhhhh  up to? What Uhhhh...How are these days?
Hehehehe... Yeah..... Stupid.... Um....? I had a dream about a bear, and an old lady, and a snail, and you were there, and the snail killed you... or something...
Uhhh... Yeah! On TV! Does that count?
Yeah?
Yes.
Wait... So... We have to snatch gems out of all the crowns of power?
Why do we have to snatch them? Can't we just ask them for 'em?
Oh yeah... I forgot.
I think so...
So deep...
I want candy!  You got anything in the saddlebag?
The Enchiridion? How'd ya get this?!
A bear?
WHOA!
Whoa!
What is this this stuff?
Whoa... Cool!
Yeah!
Princess! Princess! I need the gem from your crown!
OOOOWWWW!
HUH?

Ba.... Billy?
Lich! You... You messed Billy up! You just wanna mess me all up! Mess everyone up! You tricked me!
Oh no no no no no no no NO MORE TRICKS! YOU'LL NEVER GET THIS BOOK!
Uhhhhh....
Huh.... What?
HOLD ON JAKE!!!  YAH!!!
Coming Mom!  Man, she seems steamed! Guess I done something up yet again... Come on Jake.That's not a shooting star.  It's just a firefly.
What are you gonna wish for dude?
I think I'm wishing for the same thing!
How do you even control those things?
Oh wow!
What the...
Don't worry, princess. Jake and I are on it.
Whoa! Fudge, man! This place is yoga balls huge!
Hey, man, I can't analyze everything that comes out of my mouth.
Nah, man. Look.
You're a cool guy, Jake.
Man, there're so many passage ways and stuff. It'll take us forever to find those Hot Dog Kni-iights?
We're just gonna follow Jake's body back.
Wishes?  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Dang, Jake. Your body's getting thin!
Yeah, but now...  not so nice.
Wrap 'im up, Jake!
Jake, you need to take it easy on the stretching, man.
Uh, yeah.  Wait! Stop, Jake. Ya hear that?
This place is weirding me out. Keep your eyes open for traps and junk.
Oh, snap! That's you dude.
Boop.
Boop boop. Boop boop boop boop boop.
Oh my Grob!
Sick!
I don't think this is a good idea, man.
Ah, uh, okay...
Woah!  Hmm, looks like the final puzzle. You think you can stretch up there, buddy.
Whoa! Jake, you okay?!
Okay, dude this is too far! No more maze, we're going home.
Jake, no! You're gonna get hurt.
Jake, no!
That must be the wishes!
You did it, man. No we can go wish for a...
JAKE!
I knew we should have turned back!
Just hang tight, buddy. I'll use my wish to save you.
No! Jake is all jacked up.
Jake! Get up and carry us across!
Jake! Stay with me, man!
But we did it, okay! I can wish you out of here, man!
Okay,  So you guys should wish to get your buddies back, right?
Wow, you guys are really stupid.
Jake! Wish for the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant! Then I'll wish to save you!
You wasted your wish, man!
That's crazy, man! I gotta save your life.
I... wish... for... the Ancient PSYCHIC TANDEM WAR ELEPHANT!
I'm on it.  Rah!  Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant. HEAR ME!
You know I am, because you're psychic!  Now wish for my friends to be healed!
Now, bust us outta here!
Yeah, boyyy!Whoa, stop your crying, you two. We'll help you find your daughter. We'll find her using Jake's muscles.  Dude, show off your muscles!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Dude, I know where Lumpy Space Princess is. She's in the woods eating beans.
Easy as childbirth!
Why were you up here in this tree?
Hmm. I guess we can help this guy real quick and then get back to LSP.
Wait! You can't eat this food! It's not ours to give!
Now, show us the way to your town.
Okay.
Whoo.
It's you!
Are you in here making out with the monster?
So these were talking wolves?
LSP, you're stealing!
LSP, if you wanna feel better, you should apologize to the farmers and make amends.
LSP!
That apology was terrible!
Well, you don't have to.
LSP, are you okay?
It's working!
No problem.Whaaaa?
Oh... my glob.
For real? With the Cosmic Owl and everything?
Whoa, a real croak dream?
Yeah, well no I mean, I don't want you to die! And where was I? I'm your best friend!
Ummm... Yeah, yeah I guess. .
I'll take a look.
It's the Banana Man!
Shhh!
I don't know!
Uhh no, he left.
Jake, your croak dream just gave us the upper hand, we can cheat now, now we can cheat fate.
We'll track down that Banana Man and crunk up his schemes and save you!
What?
Dude, STOP. SAYING. ALL THIS. CRAZY. NONSENSE. It's makin' me messed up. I'm 13. You're messin' me up.
We'll see about that, come on!  Wait, just let him walk a few more steps.
'Cause that idiot's about to walk right into the sun and burn up. And we'll be done with him.
Oh, what?! He built his house on the sun?! This guy's insane!
No, why?
Oh. Right on. Lets chase after him!
Yeah, yeah whatever you say, Mom. Lets go!  C'mon!  What's he doin' with that glass?
Jake! Stop talkin' about your croak dream. It makes me uncomfortable.
No dude!
Hand me some leaves and twigs and stuff.  Hmmm.
Naw, man.  It's just a warning shot to scare him in to moving far away from here.
I'm gonna try to shoot this arrow again.
Don't worry Jake were gonna get this guy.
I'm gonna cry man... if you say that one more time, I'm gonna... Let's go fetch that first arrow to reuse, 'cause we're out of arrows.
No!
Shusher, you're not getting on that rocket!  Err!  Jake!
Jake no!!
Aww!  Nooo!
No!
No I'm not gonna let you die!
Don't do this!
No!
Please.  Please.
No.  Please.
Jake!
That's right! I wasn't in his dream! That means...
Jake! Jake!  Jake I'm coming with you!
No, it's okay, I'm here to stay by your side!
Heh, heh yeah.
Well in that case, I'll just have to never leave your side ever again for the rest of our lives.
I can never leave your side ever again for the rest of our lives.
For the rest of our lives
I know where you live
Ooh! Ooh!Princess, let us deliver the tarts.
Princess, I have never been more sure of anything in my whole life!  I'll do anything it takes to keep you alive and safe. We won't let you down.
Wow.  They're so beautiful.
Mmm hmm.
Hey Princess, what are all these bubbling chemicals all over the place?
Oh.
Wait. I got a sick plan!
Go!
Goodbye! You'll be fine! Hahaha!
Look, everyone expects the tarts to on that Royal Tart Path. Cinnamon Bun will be our decoy while we take the one path no thief expect a tart toter to take: the Desert of Doom!
Huh, not as scary as I thought it'd be.
You know, I think my plan might be kinda brilliant. I mean, I'm not saying I'm the brilliant, but it's a pretty brilliant plan, I think.
Yeah, and the Back-Rubbing Ceremony is right over those mountains.  This tart tote is gonna be a total tart walk.
What is it?
Does it smell like a tart thief's campfire?
Better check it outcan't be too careful.
Crud! I was sure we'd be safe in the Desert of Doom!
Those are dirty tart burglers!
No, man, they are cold-blooded tart destroyers and we have to get them before they get us.
They're gonna kill Princess Bubblegum by stealin' our tarts!
Yeah, go on, get! We'll mash you up crazy!  You! Listen up and tell your friends: the next time you wanna steal one of our tarts!
You know we do! And the next time you want to steal one!  You picture this guy right here  chewin' on your brain!  What the?!  That thing's gettin' the tarts!
Son of a.
But... my brilliant plan.
What the?
They're, um... th-they're
Uhh, yeah! Right! Everything's, uhbazoobs! Oh, look, something is eclipsing the sun. It's so dark now.
No! All this was just some freak bad luck, but we still got some tarts and the princess is still safe.
You know what? Even though it totally wasn't our fault, it's probably for the best that we lost those tarts.
Well, it's like a reminder to really stay sharp and play it extra safe.
For instance, take this scary cavern, here. No sane person would ever bring a tart down there. So...
Exactly.
P.U.!
Jake?
Hey, man, did you just, like, sniff my butt?
Yeah.
Huh. Alright.
Yeah, Jake?
No.
Jake, let me see those matches.
What?!
Aaaaah!
We blew it, man! My plan suckedit sucked all alongbut I was blinded by my hubris! Now PB is gonna get got, and it's all my fault!
You really think so?
Huh?
But I
It's over. PB's gonna get croaked.
You're right! Jake, let's go save Princess Bubblegum!
NOOOOO!!!!
Aaaaah! ... Huh?
Dude, they were just slicing tarts!
He must have delivered the decoys...
Nooo!
Princess, don't eat that tart!
No, Princess, no!
The princess has been paralyzed!
That means we must have been carrying the poisoned tarts all along!
Yep! All part of my master plan.
I-Ialright, here it comes.  I had a brilliant plan to tote the tarts along a dangerous path, but I mucked it up.  You oughtta give this toter job to Cinnamon Bun. He's the real hero.
I'm sorry for not following your instructions and for lying to you about it.
Oh!
Uhh, yeah, I guess so.
Sheesh!Tree Trunks! The slumber party is about to start. Get those hot buns in here, girl!
Did you hear me? I said, Get those hot!
Hi, Mr. Pig.
Why are you hitting me?
I was just talking about Tree Trunks's hot.
Uh-oh, uh-oh!
You take it, Princess. This is your party.
Hey, PB.
Mm?
Wha? Really?
What about the Candy People?
Whoa!
Noice.
Yeah, we went out the secret coat passage.
Hmm. Candy peeps can be a handful, huh?
Aw! So squish!
Okay.
Mmm... probably gonna hit up the arts and crafts kingdom with BMO. You?
Wows. Do you ever get tired from doing princess work all the time?
Cool, like taking ice cream breaks?
Yeah. Kind of like how I've been thinking about my dad and how I want him to act more like daddy. But, but maybe acting like daddy just isn't what he does. Maybe my dad's not a dad but a kid stuck in a dad's body.
Timmy knows what's up!
Mmm... fire.
What?  Gonna send this to Jake.
Uh, it's
Mm. You won't like it, but okay.
Oh.
Yuss!
Thanks for showing me around, PB. I've enjoyed just, just hanging out.
Jake just sent me a funny picture of himself.
What? Why aren't you freaking out?Ice King, get out of Princess-Jake?  Drat! Hmmmmmmm.  Ah!
Hey, Lady. Listen. Your husband got abducted by Kee-Oth the demon.
Yeah, your hubby - your boyfriend or whatever.
Yo, my Korean is not that good. Can you just get over here? We need to find a way to Kee-Oth's dimension ..
Alright. That sounds...affirmative. See you soon. Bye.
Whoop! She's here.
What is it, Lady?
What?
Eh, something skip? I don't know. Just play it, BMO.
Dad!
BMO! Skip!  Skip!!
That should be good.
Hold on, BMO, I feel like we should watch more of this video for clues, but you gotta promise me that I'm not going to see more weird Jake stuff.
Okay, high-five! Play it, BMO!
No time, Beemo.  Let's go find the cave from the video. Maybe we'll find more clues there.
Kee Oth Zaple Myrups Rama Mancakes?
Whoa.
Jake?  Yeesh.
Jake?
Jake, what do I do? Should I kill him?
With this!
That's right! Demon blood beats demon!
Lady! Don't break the circle of protection!
Aw geez, he's sucking my sword off it's hilt!
Except it's not demon blood! It's a frozen grape juice that was blessed by the priest.
Bless this sword, fodder.
Mmm, grape-y!
Let's go, bros!
Yo, guys, I still love Flame Princess.Jake. Jake!  Hey man, shouldn't we conserve our energy? The Ice Cream Marathon starts tomorrow.
You sure like ice cream.
It came from over there .
Whoa, Jake! Check it out!
It's a brave little Gnome Knight.
Yeah, you've had a good run.
Quest?
Tell me more about this... quest.
We will take your quest.
Sure!  Consider it guarded.
Oh. Okay. Thanks.
Whoa!
We took over the quest!
Ah, I miss him already.
What about the quest?
I gave him my word.
No, man! We're on the job. And like you always say, Work and fun don't mix...
That's a terrible idea.
And we can make it to the Ice Cream Marathon!
What? But we have to be ready for evil!
Alright Finn, Jake's a lazy bum and this soil is ripe with evil. I cannot go to sleep until that evil bean sprouts and is destroyed.
AAAH!  Wake up, Jake! This is it!
Aah! Bean pod!  I can't tell if it's evil yet.
Huh? Baby Pigs dressed in silly costumes?
Careful, Jake. It could be a trap. We should test them to see if they're... evil.
Okay. Each one of you take one test and one pencil. You have one hour to complete the test and prove we shouldn't kill you.  And begin.
That doesn't fare well for their...  grade point average.
Hmm, you might be right.  The only thing on here is a cute drawing of an ice cream cone under Do you have allergies? Yeah,  nothing evil. Okay, the pigs are good.
Oh, no!  Jake, get ready. The second pod is about to drop. PROTECT THE PIGLETS!
Show me what you have to offer, pod!
Magical wands?
Stop, Jake!
Is it evil?
Hmm...  Hahahaha! Glitter on its own could be evil. But with rainbows? Over my dead body!
Yeah!
Phew!
They look so sleepy and peaceful. We have to stay alert. The evil pod could appear at any time. When it does, we must be ready to destroy it immediately.
Yeah, man.
Rhombus.
AH! Look! The third pod!
Yeah, man. We've gotta kill it now.
Squirting?!
Dang, man! Don't just lick stuff! It's evil!
Is the evil sucking you in?  JAKE!
Are you poisoned?! Are you dying?
Look, Jake! It's filling back up!
Well, if this pod's not evil....  The piglets are gone!
Let's go! The screaming sounds are getting stronger near Mushroom Town!
Piglets! Stop this!
Cram! Now I must find these wicked piglets' weakness and use it to retribuse them.
That's it! Ice cream!
Yes... yes! HA! The exams confirm my memory of the piglets being allergic to ice cream.
I see one of them! Get ready to release! RELEASE!
Ah, gross man!
JAKE! Jake!  Jake, are you okay?
Wha--?
YAAAAAAAAAH!
Freezed to meet you!
Hope you saved room for dessert!
Killing you with ice cream!
Whoa!  Jake! There's one left... and I think he's trying to surrender.
But he's dressed as a little construction worker! It's freakin' adorable.
I just don't know if I can bring myself to do it, Jake.
You're sort of welcome.
He likes ice cream.
Haha, nice job, tubby. But save room for the Ice Cream Marathon.
He just really likes ice cream.Careful! You'll wreck my gift for Princess Bubblegum.
It's... a scale model of the Candy Kingdom, made out of my saliva!
Yup!  HEY, NO
I just wanted to give 'er somethin', uh... to celebrate her science... thing.
You think it's science-y enough for 'er?
Wha?!
Oh!
Oh, I... I made you somethin'.
Yes. Close your eyes.
Get ready to open your eyes!
No, wait, uh, keep 'em closed for, like, three more hours!!
MEAT!! WAH!!  DIE, YOU FIRE!!!
Oh. Heh... Thanks, Princess. I'm always happy to help.
Anything you want...
Uh... Yeah!
Ah?
I can't hang with those guys. I'm full of stupid.
Oh, Brain Town!
The Library of the Undead...
But I have to cram this info!
And I'll just read this book about pigs.
I'm bored now, too!
But... w-w-we were just enthusiastic about learning!
Hmm... So, if I can't book-learn for beans, we'll just get some smarty to explain scientific junk to me!
Jake... we're goin' to college.
Rad!
Jake. You can just shrink yourself down.
Hey, teach. Can you talk more about scientific... uh... stuff and things?
Ohhh...
Uh... Wormy... uh, Wormy McSquirmy!
Hey! Ow! Please! Where's your compassion?!
Jake, let's get outta here!  OW!
Well... that's it. I'm all outta ideas on how to learn this junk.
No... That's the easy way out.
Oh! Oh, yeah! Let's go visit Choose Goose and his magical shack!
Yeah, Choose Goose! I need magic! Some kind of mind-enhancing magic.
So... I just put those on, and then I'd be able to give that lecture... and Princess Bubblegum will totally dig it. Yeah! Whadaya want for it, CG?
Hmm... Oh!
Everything small is just a small version of something big!! I understand everything!!
Oh, Jake... I'm better than okay. I know exactly how to impress the princess.
No. No. Those spit bubbles were as fragile as my old perception of reality. But wait! Maybe you're on to something! I could show the princess bubbles the likes of which no one has ever seen!!
I'll start with a solid bulleted list!
Yes, yes, how charming. What... quaint notions.
Ladies and gentlemen... and princess...  I'm here to talk about multi-dimensional bubbles! But I'm not just going to talk about blowing bubbles! I'm going to blow... your... minds!
This is a bubble-blower of my own design. With this, you can blow bubbles in different dimensions.  This two-dimensional bubble casts a one-dimensional shadow.  A three-dimensional bubble casts a two-dimensional shadow.  A fourth-dimensional bubble casts a three-dimensional shadow... IT IS BEYOND COMPREHENSION!  Beyond space!! Beyond time!!
Yes... A BLACK HOLE!!!
It's okay. I'm sure the solution is on my bulleted  LIST!!  Don't worry. I have everything under control.
YES!! AND THEIR BRAINS ARE RELEASING ADRENALINE! DOPAMINE! EVEN DIMETHYLETRYPTAMINE FROM THE PINEAL GLAND! This has serious educational value!! Thanatophobia and this NDE is giving us euphoric altered awareness!! Don't you see, Princess?!? WE WERE ALL BORN TO DIE!!
NO, OF COURSE NOT! I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE GREATEST CONFERENCE EVER!!!
What?! No way! I'm, like, the smartest guy in Ooo, thanks to these glasses!
But
What's goin' on?!  WHOA!!!
Then I'll kill it... with this!
Wha? Fourth-dimensional! Jake! Let me go!
I can't help it, man!!  I'm all about stupid!! YAAAAAAH!!!
Huh? Knew what? I wrote that list when I was insane with smartness!Waah!
Um...  hey. Uh, Jake isn't here. He's sleeping over at Lady Rainicorn's maybe.
Oh, what?! I'll help you. I'll do anything for you.
Mm-hmm. Of course.
Girls' bathroom is over there. Also, it's the boys' bathroom.
So, what do you think, CB? You think I still have a shot with her, right?
Does she ever talk about me? Is she seeing anybody?
No and no, she does talk about me, or no and no, she isn't seeing anybody?
So... your Fire Wolf can fly.
Hmm.  Whoa! You've cooled down a lot.
Things have been going great for me lately. Been hanging out with my boys. I got a cursed sword arm now, so that's new. Yeah, I've been exercising a lot and taking some piano lessonstrying to improve myself. Not dating anybody or anything, just getting a little me time, being the best Finn I can be.
Oh, no!
I hid my flameproof suit behind these rocks... just in case, whatever, you know?
Suited!
Remember my fire suit? Hey, CB, you did a great job getting us here and everything,  but I got this, all right?
I got a sword arm, so
Watch this.  Hey, guards! Come at me at the same time!
Let's go, Princess!
Ha-ha!
Ahhhhhh
Oh, right.  Oh, no.
There's CB!
Don't worry, FP, your boy Finn won't fail you.
Trust me. It'll be fine.
Yeah! It's because you secretly still have feelings for me.
Hmm.
Jeez. Did I just get shown up by Cinnamon Bun?The Goblins have suffered long enough, Xergiok!
Wands are for wimps!
And stay out, Muffin Top!
Nice to meet you.
No, man, I'm an adventurer for life.
Stop the riot!
I'll become your king! To save y'all, from yourselves.
Hahaha, yeah!
That's pretty neat.
Whoa!
And I call...
Hmmm. Sounds boring.
Hey, Jake, want to stay awake and hear some rules?
Alright, lay it on me, Gummy.
Whoo!!
Whoooaa!!!! Look at that huge mirror... and it's painted baby blueboy style.
Whooo!!! Awesome!
Yaaaah!! Whoa, ease up, dudes. Finn access only.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Oh! Oh. Guys, put your hams away.
I'm not gonna spank your hams. I'm not that kind of king!
You can brush my teeth... I guess.
This brunch looks great! Can't wait to dig in.
Gummy, as king, I order you to let me cut it.
I'm cutting it, Gummy!
Thank you, Gummy.
Yeah.
Gummy, just let me do this. No one will know.
Uhhhhhh, Jake, this is nuts.
I'm not hungry, Gummy.
No, Gummy. It's just....
A thief? Hahaha, yes! I'll handle it!
Hey, thief!
I got a speech for you
What.
I can't let this go on.  Hands off, thief!!
Ha!! Here you go, old lady.
Iyouwhat?
No, wait.
I just want to help y'all as much as I can, and y'all just keep showing me your goblin hams.  When I became king, I didn't think y'all would show me your rears, but I'll accept my boring fate, and shed this tear...  'cause I can't seem to cure you of your groundless fears.
Gummy, don't be afraid. I'm gonna stick to the rules now, okay?
If I defeat Xergiok as king, I can prove to the goblins that an active king can be a good king, but I can't let them know until it's all over. Stay fainted, Gummy.  Ooooooooh! Whisper Dan, have you seen Jake?
Xergiok's back with an army of Earclopses. Let's bust them up.
Hmmmmmmm.
No way, man.
Jake, the goblins can't see me being unkingly. I need a disguise.
Shut your kissin' hole, Xergiok! It's time for a beatin'.
wowowowowowowowowoowowoow!
Dude, no one uses Earclopses in a battle without earplugs.
C'mon, dude, lets get out of here.
Well, looks like they got the king they wanted, buddy.
And we're going home to adventure.
High five us, dude.  Hey, Jake?
Why do the insides of you smell like vanilla?
Huh, neat.Hey, PB,  what's up?
PB, who's the new guy?
Hey, man.
Oh, cool. That's coolyou're dating, that's coool. See ya, Princess.
What'd ya think of that Braco guy? I mean, he seems kinda weird  and passive and baby lambish  and too unheroic for Peebs.  And then I smashed that peach!
That road you're on leads to nowhere.Oh!  Parm, parm, parm.  Asiago's like parm.  Whoopsies.   Okay, now easy does it.
Ohh!
Thanks a lot, Dad!
I... messed up the spaghetti,  and then I got mad, and PB's candy arm exploded.
Yeah, it wasn't the greatest. Sorry about the spaghetti, though.
I can't?
My melon wants to punch my dad in the face and steal his arm.
Melon heart... melon heart... man, I don't know. It'd be so easy if I could just go find himmy dad that is. That portal he went through after ripping off my favorite arm went right to outer space. And outer space is up there somewhere... I'm told. Maybe Banana Man could help me build a rocket or something...  or some stairs or... something, something, something... or, or, or.   Wow, it's like alike alike a magic Finn arm.  She's powerful. You must've exploded the candy arm before and made the rock pile just know. It's almost like I'm trying to tell myself something, like a message from my melon heart.
Daddy's got an arm and baby's gonna harm his arm by tearing it off his dad.  Baby's building a tower into space. Space is where he's gonna find his dad.  Daddy's got an arm and  baby's gonna harm his arm by tearing it off his dad.  Baby's building a tower into space. Space is where he's gonna find his dad. Daddy's got an arm, and baby's gonna harm his arm by tearing it off his dad.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Waah.
What? No, I'm Finn.
Okay, I'm going to keep going.
Oh, baby's a tower into space. Space where he's gonna find his dad.
Baby's building a tower into space, to tear off his dad's arm.  From like where that round of the arm bone meets that weird flat bone on the top of the back. Gonna pull that until it comes off. Baby's building a tower of revenge...
Finn.
Uh, yeah, for revenge. I think it'll feel good.
You should have pulled off their legs.
What was that?
Hmm.
Interesting. Oh hey, what are your thoughts on melon hearts?
Daaaad!?  Ah. Oh man. My nog master.  Hello?  Hell-oh!  Hey, hey dad?
Gotcha! Ha, ha, hee, hee, hee, hee.  Give, give it. Give me the... give me give it. Give me the...
Butts. Butts.
No. Wait, what?
PB? Wait, where am I?
Right, right.
Hmm.  Yeah, okay. Thanks Princess.
Um, neutral I guess. I don't want to punch my dad anymore.
Yes I do.Wha?
Wha?!
She's got me! She's got me!
Whoa. Jake? Was I...?
She's got... Wha?
Eh, it's gone. I don't know.
I'm what?
Oh, yeah. The vault. That's where the stuff I can't handle goes. Kerplunk.
Yeah.
No, sir.
It's alright. I'm not hurting anybody.
NO!
Cool.
Okay. I'm sorry I did that.
Yup.
There's a cricket in here.
What is it?
Hmmm. She likes those games where you're, like, collecting materials to make stationary.
A'ight, let's peep it.
Regression Simulator? Uh, okay.
Start.
Whoa.
The vault.
I see... my past lives.
I was a comet...
A butterfly...
A thing... I don't know what that is. Some kind of shape? Or a doodoo in another dimension?
Scary lady?
Yeah. I was her! Except she was a chubby tiger.
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait. She was riding a tiger, and she wasn't scary.
The past was to be reckoned with.
Hey, hey. This way.
Okay, here you go.
It's me, Shoko! And PB, you're like a bazillion years old. You're not freaking nineteen! What the heck?!
Weirdo.
Heh. My vault feels lighter.Right. Right. I knew that.
It's okay. I won't ever let you go.  That's... true.
Wow. Already? That was fast.
What? Now?
Like, right now?
Ah. Where am I?  What the heck? Is that the comet?  And a little farming village? How long have I been walking?
Wow. I need some water.
Hmm...Fields are lookin' a little sparse.  Kinda runty...I wonder if this village even has any wat oh snapI see some!
Excuse me sir, can I have some water? I've been sleepwalking for days.
Haha awesome.  Haha! Heck yeah! Thanks little friend! You just totally saved my life. No pun intended. Whassamatter? can't talk? Oh, or are you guys comet boys? From up in there? Listen I'm no expert, but I think y'all are gonna need a lot more corn.  And it's suppose to stand straight up-like. Or, maybe comet boys only need, just like, a little bit of limp corn?
What the?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad! What the heck are you doing here?
What? You were just yelling at me.Jake, these clouds are beautiful, dude.
Holy stuff!
Yeah!
Hey, Ice King!
Stop hurting that ant, you old bag! Or you're gonna get it!
Ow, Jake!
Turn it off, Jake!
We've got to stop it!
Okay, Ice King. We'll keep it distracted, and you sacrifice yourself to destroy the wand.
Hey, wand!  I heard you pay a robot to rub your tummy for you!
Now, Ice King!
Wow! That was awesome, dude!
Yeah, man.I just wanna see 'im put on that crown.
Too bad we don't have the key to this.
Whoo-hoo!
Jake. Are these donuts?
But maybe they're poisonous donuts!  Yeah! Sniff it, Jake! Suck up those toxins!
What gives?!
Holy slug, lady! Calm down!
AAH!  Dude, are you okay?
What did she do to you?
For stealing one of your billions of donuts?!
The point is you overreacted.
Total support, dude.
Aw, now you're just makin' these up!
There's gotta be a way to get your powers back! Where'd they come from, anyway? Were you born with them? Or... did you have a freak industrial accident?!
What happened next?!
Okay! Then our course is clear! We'll roll you in every mud puddle in Ooo until we find the one that'll restore your powers.
Jake, come on! We've always been lucky, buddy! Maybe the first mud puddle we find will be the right one!
Then away! Hyuh! Whoo-hoo!
Oh, my gosh!
We run! Run like energetic little boys!
Come on, lazy bones!
I guess you could ride on my backpack.
You're... strangling me... a little, is all.
Look there! Across the River of Junk! There's an ideal mud puddle.
We can swim this river easy!  Come on, Jake!
Jake! Stop talking to yourself! Cross over already!
What's wrong with that guy?  Then just wait for me there!
Did it work?!
YEAAAAH!  This isn't working at all.
Okay... Then let's just go find another mud puddle.
Agh! This is stupid! Just go back to the witch and apologize and get your powers back!
YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRYING, MAN!  First, you won't run,  a-and now you keepand... a-and no matter what, I juyou...
But you are an adventurer.
Oh, um... How do I say, You're the grossest thing ever, without offending you?
How do we beat power like that?!
What is it, buddy??
YAAAAH!
Jake?
Jake!  I never should have doubted you!
Ahhh, so is that how you got your powers back? You apologized to the witch?Oh, hey, man.
Is it glowing?
It's cool, man. I know you want to eat the whole thing, and I'm cool with that.
Jake, wait!
He's not frozen. He's super slow-mozin', motion. Look.
Well, let's go grab it before he hits the ground, which is when I assume he'll take a bite.
Hmm.  Feels like cold spaghetti.
Oh... hey, Jake.
I don't know.
Whoa, how long were we in there?
BMO!
You're not helping.
Alright, BMO!
Wait, wait, wait. BMO, are you just making a skateboard video?
Relax.  I'm calling Princess Bubblegum. It's ringing.
Thanks again for coming, Prubbles.
So, how's it looking?
Of magic?
Oh.
Who ya calling?
The vampire queen?!
Yeah, man!
Hey, man. What are you doing?
I am not giving up.  Let's see. Who should I call? Ice King? Shelby? Tree Trunks?
Jake, look!
Because you've never been this sad! That's what Magic Man meant by your face showing 7:20, or as some people call it, a sad face.
Nope! No! Don't get judgmental.
Jake, every time you get happy, you slow down! Stay sad, man! Make yourself sad!
No, man! Stay sad! Make yourself sad!
Yeah, Jake! The wetter, the better! Keep crying!Blah-la-luh. Hey, Jake, give me some of that apple.
Huh?
No, I'm not! And... I wouldn't even do that ever.
Hmmph.  Ehggg-uh-ya-uh. Uh, should I keep going, Mrs. Yoder?
Okay.  Let us know if you need anything else. Hyah!
Hunh.
Hey! Do you hear that? She called us heroes!
Why were you hiding in that shrub?
Why do you need princess hair?
Oh, well, uh, we know lots of princesses.
Why not?
Maybe she's a good witch.
So what do we do? Tell her we can't help her 'cause she's ugly?
Uh, yeah, totally!
Dude, I don't think it's working.
Look, Lady, we can't help you get princess hair.
Because... we only help when someone's in danger.
Grrrrrr.... Yaah!
Maybe.
All right, fine!
What? Why?
O...kay.
It's Princess Muscles's castle!
Uh, hey, Princess Muscles.
Um, you were the nearest princess, and I need a lock of your hair.
You do?
Aah! What are you doing?
Why? I want hair, not hug!
No! I--I'm here to save you! From your hair! It looks really bad. Cut it off, quick!
I am terrible at talking to ladies.
Hmm... Where's a princess? Princess?... Princess... Princess... Who's that?  It's Lumpy Space Princess.  Does she... live in the woods now?
Huh. Wait. Does she even have hair?  She does! Well... hair is hair.
Because they're, uh... So--
No, I don't! I-I'm just stopping by because--
What am I gonna do? Huh? A graveyard? Yes! There's got to be a hairy princess in there that won't think I'm hitting on her! Princess? Princess? Princess? Ugh! Come on! Bingo!  Here lies Princess Beautiful. She was so beautiful. Hey, that's perfect! And sort of macabre. Oh, well.  Aha!
Ohh!
Where's her hair?!
Here lies Princess Beautiful. She was so beautiful, but died of baldness?! Dang it!
Jake! Jake! I'm sorry, man. Getting princess hair is -- is impossible! They all just think I'm in love with them! Ugh! I can't do it. You're gonna have to spend the rest of your life in this witch's butt.
Wait. You mean like go on a date?
Jake!
Okay! Hold on!
Princess Bubblegum!
Uh... I need you to come with me!
Just come on. We don't have much time!
We're gonna have a spaghetti dinner.
Put your butt here! Hurry!
Hey, Simon, make it romantic.  Oww! Here, shove this in your mouth! It's hot!
Please, Princess! Just stick it in your mouth!
Um, Princess... do you like me?
Really?
Yes! Now give me some of your hair!
Thank you, Princess Bubblegum!!
Totally did it! Genuine princess hair. You hear that, Jake?
All right, lady, a deal is a deal.
It is bubblegum!
WAIT!
If I learned anything today, it's that I'm awesome at talking to ladies! And, lady, you are crazy ugly!
Having beautiful hair isn't gonna get you anywhere, because you're ugly, inside and out, so ugly I want to throw up.
No one will ever find you beautiful. everrr! And it's got nothing to do with the ol' chrome dome. It has to do with what's in here.  Can you get off my friend now?
Gee... I feel kind of bad.
Hey, witch! Does it have to be princess hair?
Well then, check this out!  HA HA-A-A-A-A-A!!!
Sure!
Totally beautiful.  inside and out!
What?!Sorry.
Yeah. That's what she said.
No way!
No way, man, I got no expectates. Whatever happens happens.
Lates, bro.  Comin'!
Hey-ey, things got fancy around here.
Oh, uh, you know mepretty good with weird stuff.
Yeah. We all love Jake.
Yo, Peebs. How's your lemon?
Hey, princess! Look who happens to carry a flute with him.
Okay. Let me know if you get lonely!
What about a prank?
Mmm, I don't know. Maybe if we prank Lemongrab, like, just right, they'll let us take that guy home? Yeah. Prank.
Pranks, like old times.
Okay.  Puddin'  Bakin' soder.  Vinegar.  And the bait.  Now when Lemongrab stirs his pud  splode-cano.
A-ha! Now give us back Lemonhope or prepare for mo' pranks!
Guess I must admit. One would have a hard time claiming that to have been a pretty good plan. Sorry, PB.
Oh.
Yike!
What? No! Let's, um... we could do another prank! I brought some of your super-spicy hot sauce! Ah, so spice!
But, my other plan worked.
Your plan? But I thought we were having fun together.
Oh. Yeah, no, that's cool.
Get to safety, princess! I'll hold 'em off.
Wait, so do you not like any games, or just little boy games?
Well, yeah, mostly. But I think I learned something.
Well, I'm thinkin' maybe age isn't just a number. Maybe older people, like, really are different. Y'know? Like, less fun inside.
I'm saying I think I really sponked up. I gotta patch things up with Flame Princess.
What?!I'll be there in a sec!
Good, man!
Okay, man! Whatevs!
Okay, Finn. She's 13; you're 13. Just have fun! Be yourself.  Wooooo!
What's that? Are you trying to make yourself 18 again?
I don't bathe. I want that!
WAAAUGH! Hot, hot, ohWAAAAUGH! Oh... so spice! So spice!
Watch your manners with the princess--!
What the huh?
That's bunk! Right, Preebos?
We'll see you in a few hours... okay, Starchie?
Yeah... like pranking him up his face!
What? No, no! He just needs some more prankin's to finish the job! He'll leave the kingdom. Let's try it my way this time, okay?
I got a new plan!
We'll work together and use that serum you made. The one that was Ah! So Spice! And spice-bomb him non-stop 'till his butt falls out! How's that sound?
Hoooo!
You ready to pour the stuff?
Wait 'till he opens the lid!
Shh!
Heh, heh... heh!
Maybe if we... set his butt on fire.
What? No! I mean... you can do that?
Then... why did you wait so long?
Hm?
Yeaaah...
Princess? I think I can help.
Finished!
Are you ready, Princess?
Me, too!
I... I know, Princess.
Oh- you're welcome! But... uhm...
Well, ah... Do you... do you wanna hug some more?
Oh- yeah, yeah... Sorry...
Hello?
Bad news, man... I... I got dumped.
Yeah, man. I see what you're sayin'. Thanks, Jake.
Go up the wizard steps.Yeah, apple pie!
I'm gonna eat it all before you even GET there!
Apple pie!
Why are you throwing the pie away?
Woohoo! Pie, yeah!
Wow.
What are you talking about, Tree Trunks? What can be better than your apple pie?
Anything? Well, I'd catch a shooting star, travel to outer space and fight space monsters!
What would you do, Tree Trunks?
...Lame.
I'm sorry. I mean, it's just you pick apples every day.
Where is it?
Whoo! Tree Trunks you gotta go pick that apple!
Tree Trunks! This is your dream! Think about eating that apple with your own mouth.
Imagine the flavor.
Yeah, and we'll help you.
No, Jake. She has a weak heart.
Ewww, why is this ground all squishy?
Okay. I'm cool with you letting you do whatever you want.
Uhh, Tree Trunks, stay away from that.
Ugh, you're gonna get it, wall of flesh.
Careful, Tree Trunks, this thing is evil.
Huh? Tree Trunks!
You better stay in that tree, baby. Um, Tree Trunks were you putting stickers on that evil monster?
Tree Trunks? Ugh. Jake, I just realized that Tree Trunks is old and bonkers. We can't take her through this Evil Dark Forest.
But the monsters?
Are you sure? 'Cause she has zero adventurer training.
Maybe it is fine. Tree Trunks?
Tree Trunks!
We gotta find her, Jake! Tree Trunks!
Tree Trunks, run!
Time to call your mamas, evil sign posts.
Errr...
NO!
I'm not hugging you! I'm trying to save your life! There's too many!!
Errrr. Tree Trunks, I'm all jacked up because of you. Look at my jacked up face!
No, I'm not mad. You're too super-cute for me to be mad at you, and you're a top notch adventurer. Now, let's go find and eat the heck out of that crystal gem apple together.
Dang it!
Awesome.
Uh, what are you doing here, Tree Trunks?
It's not a guy, Tree Trunks! It's a Snake Armed Ruby Brain Beast!
Jake! You were supposed to watch her!
GET her out of here!
I can't find it's magic gem weak spot!
Oh, there it is.
Tree Trunks!! You're not an adventurer! You nearly got yourself killed again! Do you wanna die, Tree Trunks?! Is that what you think adventurers do?! Die and make all their friends feel terrible 'cause they couldn't save them?!
Ugh... Tree Trunks. Tree Trunks!
Man, I feel horrible. I was only yelling because I care about her safety.
Woohoo!
Tree Trunks, I'm a huge butt guy for getting mad at you. I'm a huge fart. I was only upset because... I love you and I don't wanna see you get hurt.
Uhhhh, I don't know, I--
A crystal guardian! Tree Trunks, stay out of the monster battle this time. I don't want you getting hurt.
Radical! Back off you!
Stop copying me! Grrah!
Ahhhh! A-a-oww..
He's copying everything we do.
Gem-clam! Let's beat it up while it's copying Tree Trunks! Yaah!
Oh, man, I'm a total moron! We gotta fight this one Tree Trunks style.
Hey! Crystal Guardian, are you okay with Tree Trunks taking a bite of that apple?
Whoo! How's it taste, Tree Trunks?Whoop! Huh?
Princess, this tea party sucks in a big way! But thanks for the invite!
Princess! I think I just now mastered it!  One more bounce.  Alright!  Unh! Tea partying's hard, huh, Jake?
Lumpy Space Princess, you big faker! You're floating, not bouncing!
Dude! Your leg!
Is it serious?
Oh, no!
Calm down, bud! I'll... I'll sock the lumpiness outta ya!
LSP, please! Can you tell us how to reach Lumpy Space?
Where is it?
Just say yes! Yes, yes, yes!
AAAAH!! Whoa... Lumpy Space. So, where's the antidote?
That's so close! We can run there in no...  ...time. Aww, what?!! It's, like, a million-mile fall into space!
Uh...
Vroom vroom??
Don't you know anyone else with a car?
Call her NOW.
What's she saying?
What'd she say?
LSP, we don't have time for this. Ask for the ride, LSP.
Melissa,  you should totally drive us to Makeout Point to make out with hot boys!
Biyah.
Sorry. But Jake's lumpiness is worsening!
Ugh... OKAY! Let's go, let's go, let's go!!
It's not gonna come to that. But if it does, I'll bury you beneath the nicest, most shadiest tree!
Oh, um...  Heh heh.  CAN'T THIS CAR GO ANY FASTER?!
Finally! Huh? This doesn't look like Makeout Point.
Uh...
LSP, we gotta hurry! Jake's running out of time!
Let's go!
What does that mean?
Thanks, LSP.
Uh, yeah, bumps.
Hey, guys. Lookin' smooth!
Well, mostly you in the center, but yeah!
My best friend needs an antidote for lumpiness.
So the antidote is in that orb you were sitting on!
Can my friend borrow it?
Hammacow. Thanks, fellas.
Wait!!
Why did you have to say all those rude things to them?!
Thanks a lot!  They were right about to hand over the antidote!
You insulted them! And they got mad! And now Jake's gonna be lumpy forever!  This is all your fault!
JAKE! IT'S ALMOST SUNSET!!  Jake... I didn't save him... I...  I'LL KILL YOU, LUMPY SPACE!!
Huh? I thought you guys left!
Um, thanks.
Yeah, there's no girl. But there is still time to save Jake! Do you guys know where Promcoming is?
Awesome. Do any of y'all have wheels?
Well... you think I can make it to that land-lump if I jumped off this cliff?
What if I was lumpy? Could I float over?
That's good enough for me. Now bite me!!
Yes! I can feel the multiple bites accelerating the lumpification process! I'm starting to float!
I have to! For my buddy.  RAAAAAAGH!!!!
Ah, I made it! And there he is!
Jake! I'm mostly lumpy now! And I totally think you should sit on this sphere!
Sit on it!
Please, Jake! You're my best friend! Just sit on the sphere!
Sit on it!! Before I turn completely lumpy!!
Oh, no! I can feel the lumpiness... about to consume me!!  Oh, yah. Being lumpy's the best.
Fine. I don't want you to have it anyway.
That's right. It's mine.
NO! You can't have it!
You want it that bad? Go get it, then!
No! You can't make me! SmoothOOF!
Huh?
Man... There's something cold under my butt.  Oh!  The antidote! Just in time, too! LSP, I'm sorry I blew up at you before. I didn't mean it. I was just really stressed out.
Sounds good to me. Whaddaya say, Jake?Oh! Oh, man! My throwing and catching disc! Jake! Wanna play throw-n-catch throwing a catching disc?!
Alright
You mean bark.
Hello, I am a human. Hello, I am a human.
Back up a little!    And now for the perfect throw!  Ah, oh, hammies.   Peeeeerfeeeeeeect Throoooooow!
Aw, come on! That was the wind! The wind blows!
Naw, I'll get it!
Sometimes a man  just has to retrieve his own disc.
Thanks!
I'm trying to get to the top of this tree to get my disc.
Uhhhh, What?
I don't think that kinda thing really works, actually.
No.
Ouch!
Ooch!  Hmmm.   See! Ya did help!
Poooooped!   Pooooooped!
I'm not a chipmunk! I'm a human boy! I'm trying to climb the tree, I'm trying to get my disc back. But for now I'm takin' a break, because I am pooooped!
No thanks, I'm good, just gonna rest my meat hooks.
Naw, it's okay. I've been in worse situations. And even though I'm tiny, I do feel invigorated.
Bye! Bye!  Choo Choo!  Ya can't stop the train! Tree!   Woof.
I ate a magic apple by mistake.
Nah, I got it.
Yeah. No I won't.  I don't plan to.
Blegh! DISC!
Woooo!  Where's my dingus?
Hey! Hey, buddy! Hey, have you seen  my disc! Hey, I'm over here! Hey!
Hey! I'm over here! Have you seen my disc?
Heeey!  Musta could not heard me.  Doing, doing, doing.  Hey squirrel!
Woah!
My disc!  Uuuh, It's okay, III'm a chipmunk.
Huh?
Uuuh, I didn't say anything.   What are they gonna do to me?
What are they gonna do-
So does that mean I'm a prisoner forever?
Doesn't that mean that you can't leave the tree either?
Do you like it here?
Hey buddy.
Let's get outta here.  I got it!
Okay! I'm gonna throw the disc alongside the branch the we'll jump on it and fly away!
Perfect! Throw!  Sooo, It's a- It's a good thing you're a flying squirrel. Huh.
Peace ooooout!  Okay! Activate your squirrel flaps!
Hey! We're flying!
Wooo!  Hey look! There's Jake!  Jake!What's up?
What was that?
Yeah, I heard.
Yeah, I heard.
Whoa, you best not be believing that whack bunk. I bet he's trying to make your life bad, so you'll think you're evil. But you're really not!
Dungeons.
Let's have a good time in a dungeon or something, that always clears my head that reminds me what's what.
No, that will show you not to worry so much, because you're already good in here.
Dungeons!
Yeah... a lot of times the entrances are hidden, so you gotta look under rocks and stuff for a secret switch.
Sometimes it takes a while... Hmm.
Really?
Yes!
Ooh... gauntlet.
No prob, Bob, light this for me, will ya?
Oh...well, I guess torches are just cool for dungeons, you know?
Yeah...I like to hang on to it.
Really? I feel like it's trying too hard. Gold piece!
Whoa! Whoa!
Haha no, no, wait a sec. Sorry, one second.
He might have an important loot on him, so we don't wanna just burn him up; plus it's a little cruel even for an evil guy, check this out.  RRRAAA, you're gonna surrender!
I shall grant thee clemency! If you do the splits! Do the splits!
Do the splits, thou milk-livered maggot pie!
See, a lot of times you can overpower these guys with confidence.
Got any loot on ya?
Ha! See? This would've been burned!
What else you got?!
Hah, hah! I knew it.  Oh, cram it to the butternuts, it's locked!
Hahaha, alright. We can come back to that later.  Hey, are you having fun?
WHOA, whoa!
That's not how you do things in a dungeon. You gotta sneak.
Like this.  And you gotta look around.
Ok, this guy's too big to intimidate, but I have a plan. First, you shoot some fire at that rope, the chandelier falls, we distract the monster and we run in. Element surprise.
You ready?
Before we go in, how good are you at quietly throwing a tiny bit of fire?
Like on a scale of 1 to 100, how good are you at quietly throwing a tiny bit of fire at a rope 50 feet away?
Scale of 1 to 100.
Well, that's cool, that's cool. Just try to hit that rope.
Yeah, I'm good. it's a hologram.
Yeah, although it does raise the question. Why would someone go through the trouble of setting up a hologram? Unless... they've hidden something in this room?
Hey, wake up.
Look what I found.
We don't have to, we get to! Come on.
See? That didn't take long at all. Now we get treasure.
Nope. This key's for something else. Haha. Oh, well.
See? That's where I found the key.
Snapdragons!!
No, no, we shake them down first, remember?
Man. Ooh, hold on.  Ha ha! It's another key! Now we get to go back to the beginning!  Whoohoo!
What? Why?
What? No, wait, that's... no! Uhh, hey, you know what? Let's do things your way.
Yeah. I've been acting an uncouth lout, m'lady.  Okay, so there's a door over there. What do you wanna do?
Okay, that worked. Now what do you do...
Uhh...  Good- good job, FP.
Oh, Sham man. It's the legion of Goo Skulls! Uh, how do you defend?
Fire burn goo.
Woh.   Whoa! Flame Princess!!
Ahh!!!
Help me! But don't use fire because you'll- mphh!
Hot Daniel! Flame Princess. I thought you were going to burn me alive.
Dungeons totes clear your head, right?
Uhhhh.....
Oh yeah, cool.
Maybe next time we should just go to like... a farmer's market.
Hmm, try this key.
What is it?I won't. I really do love Finn and Jake Movie Club.
Okay, everybody. Apple juice for Tree Trunks.  Diet soda for LSP.
What did you order, PB?
Huh.
Tomato juice for Marceline.
Hot cocoa for BMO.
And finally, a thimble of milk for Shelby, the worm who lives in Jake's viola.
Jake...
We decided last time. No reserved seating. First come, first served.
Just stuff that comes at the beginning of the movies.
Alright, let's take a look.
Alright, well, goodbye.
We've been showing these films unauthorized.
We should still respect authority, mang.
Yeah?
Uhh... Uh, yeah. Maybe. I think so.
Calm down, y'all. We're gonna have Finn and Jake Movie Club next week for sure. Me and Jake just need to find a movie without that warning.
We're not gonna find a movie, Jake.
We're gonna make one!
Okay, BMO. Turn to your right, and start filming.
That was awesome, BMO.
Front shot! Front shot! Film the clouds. Don't forget the little one.
Oh, we're gonna miss it. Hurry, BMO!
Don't lose it. Oh, it looks like it's gonna fall. Follow it!
BMO, forget about the coin. Film that over there!
Zoom in.  Weird. Let's get some more footage.
Uhh, what do you think?
Yeah, I'm not engaged. I need to see something that reflects life as it is, but, you know, entertaining.
Exactly. An action adventure.
Let's get to filming!
Okay, Slime Princess! In this scene, you're gonna leap over to that vine, swing over the crocodiles, do a triple flip with a full twist and land clean. Don't fall in the water, or you'll get eaten alive. Action!
No! No smooching! Cut.
No, we can't use any of it.
No, not all. We should throw away the parts where Slime Princess was smoochin'. That was dumb.
Duuuumb-ah.
That was awesome! We need to shoot more stuff like that.
Okay PB, move back a little.  Stop.
Yeah.
Umm, Jake's gonna get the frog to hop towards him  and when he does, you're gonna run along side the chariot and it's gonna look like you're driving it.
Yeah.
What? No, that's terrible.  And action!
Hah, Jake. You... you brought the fly in too close!
Well, help me catch 'im.
This isn't a comedy!
Look, just help me catch this guy.
How much longer till you finish editing, BMO?
Twenty hours?!
Jake, let's talk about our movie.
I think we shot a lot of great stuff.
But I'm thinkin' only half of it is usable.
Really?
That's great!
You actually agree it's an action adventure!
What?
What?!
Who's right BMO?
We'll ask him when he wakes up.
And Finn.
Oh, I'll be there.
As will I, as well.
I hope y'all are ready to be on the edge of your seats for tonight's action adventure film.
Well, I guess we'll see!
BMO's right. Fighting over this movie junk is dumb. I'm sorry, man.Jake, where were you?
Dude, I found out my human dad is still alive.
He's at some place called the Citadel.
I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't. Maybe there's a good reason why he didn't raise me. Like, he was probably captured by thieves and kept a slave for years.
Yeah, maybe it's better not to rock the boat.
Heh. I guess it would be okay to meet him, just to know what I'll look like.
Hey, my dad must be like the warden there.
Ha, cool it's a penlight.  Jake, don't look directly me in theAaah!
Pew! Pew!
You ever wonder what happened to make a place all wrecked up like this?
Dude, shh. Don't wake him up.
Pizow!
Old man.
Bizzow
Let's hoof it!
Jake, don't jostle the package.
Yahct!  All right!
There's too many of them!
What now, Prismo?
Wait, this old man is you?
I don't think seeing my dad is worth sacrificing your life
Dude! That means The Lich jacked our entry into The Citadel.
Oh, dang! I think they're going to the Citadel! I'M COMING, DADDEEEEEEE!JAKE, WAKE UP! I FOUND A TRUCK!
I found it in the woods. I named it Hot Daniel. Anyway, I figured we could do some pretty sick stuff with it.
Hmm. I don't know. Launch it off some ramps, maybe get it going thirty miles per hour, crank the wheel into a gnar right-hander, spray dirt everywhere like a big hurkin' dirt wave?
Can'tengine's busted, I think.
Hmm. Maybe...  Ice King, you know anything about cars?
Hmm.
Aw, jeez, yeah. Sorry, Banana Manjust sorta happened.
Hm. Okay. That word sounds cool... but what does it mean?
Okay. Cool. Informative.  What is he pointing at?
Sweet. So where's the cylinder head, then?
Yeah! Drive time!
Cool.
Sure.
Okay, BMO. Good night, Banana Man.
Yo, BMO. Coffee.
Car looks nice, BMO.
N-i-i-i-i-i-ice.
Whoo.
Awesome!
We gotta save Bubblegum!
Look, there she is!
So, what's up with the angry mob, PB?
Punch it, 'Nana Man!
Yeah. We know.Stunts!  Hi-ya!  Yeah!
Dude, it's a spider web.
No way, I'll stunt you out! Whoah!  ...I was thinking something else would happen.
The only sharp thing I had was my fingernails, but you made me cut them.
I guess my fingernails are really loaaeaeuAAAAHH--!
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
Can you... stretch us out of here?
That's not a circle. That's, like, a straight line.
Well, don't just give up.
We gotta go, Jake! Jake!
What's going on there, Jake?
You guys are sad.  Ugh! What is that sound? Sick, dude! She makes that sound, too?
Dude, that's not cool. You need to think about what you say and how that affects your lady.
Wait!
Umm...  Right now, we gotta real-talk about your girlfriend.
Uhh...  We real-talk now, or you're going to be as single as your stinky web squirter!
I'm not in cahoots!
Okay.
I'm gonna fake eat you, man.
Okay, first off, then, how you're going about this isn't working. Am I right?
Cool, now we've gotta do damage control. Healing the negs energy at the source.
Alright, uhh...
Go find Barb a present. That'll fix the first neg. Can you do that?
You're free!  Aw, man.
Yeah, think fast, what can we use?
I have a dumb idea.
Shoot!
Ha ha, yes! Finally!
Yeah, you mommy!
Nothing.  Oh, crab apples!
Oh, uh, he's getting you an I'm sorry gift.
Yo, that's wrong!
His wife's gonna eat him!
Yeah, I'm stupid. But I know something real. You shouldn't eat your husband!
Not exactly...
What is happening!?
Aw, sick!
Think they're gonna make it?Our secret mission to capture the Ice King is underway. Though I probably shouldnt say stuff like that out loud.
Wrap attack!
We finally captured the Ice King!
Princess explained it all when she sent us on the mission, remember?
I'm sure she's got a good reason.
Where is everybody?
Sure did.
So, what did the Ice King do to--
What awful thing did he do to get tossed in there?
Wha?
You got it, princess!
Cool it, inmate!
Oh, yeah?! Well how 'bout these helmets we found? And we got the Oculus of Rehabilitation!
And the shelf of penitence!
No, Jake! It's a trick.
Finished!
Umm...
Yeah, what does it matter?
That makes sense. You do bad stuff, we punish you.
Really? Umm...
Jake, he is starting to convince me we're doing a bad thing.
Yeah... yeah! You're still a jerk that deserves to be in jail.
Uhh, it's too dark.
The jerks are us? Jake, am I going crazy? It seems like the Ice King is right about this. But if he's in the right, that means we're in...
No, it means much, much worse.
On your feet.
No, we're letting you go. We decided that it's wrong to imprison you.
Get out of here before I change my mind!
No, quite yet.
Sorry, but since we're the bad guys this time, we gotta go to jail.
You're still he--  ...Just get out out of here, man!
Like I said, it's wrong to imprison you.
I am no man's bosom.
Wow, she's so proud we did the right thing, she almost looks enraged.
What have we done?
AHHH!!!
Ice King did this?
I can't just beat up the Ice King for nothing. That's against my alignment.
But I'll get him to give up those howls. Voluntarily. I swear it.
Shhhh...
Oh, I gotta plan to trick him, but you won't like it.
Ice King, come forth!
Game night? Well, that's weird.
You do know how friends act, right? You've had friends before.
Yeah, so you know how friends are always howling in pain for each other.
Will you howl for me, pal?
No, Jake! We...
Grrr... Biscuits, now's my chance!
Boo hoo, boo hoo, boo hoo, boo hoo...
Boo hoo. You hit me, Ice King. I don't think I could live any more knowing my best bosom hit me.
I'm dying because I know you care not for me.
Harumph.
Did you see how fast he dropped my lifeless body? That's just mean.
Thanks, man.Jake? BMO?
Dude!
You guys knew?
Who are you?
Come on!
I'll get your kid back, toy!
Come on, Bubblegum!
Marceline! Are you okay?!
Don't worry. We'll get him.
No!  What?  This door shall yield to no command save for a song from a genuine band. What is this gripagrap?!
Hmm? The door said it will open for genuine band. Let's try and music this door open as a quintet.
Hey. Yeah, yeah, yeah!
It's working! Look at the door!
Come on, everybody! Don't stop now. The door was responding to our music! I wonder what it liked or what was missing.
Maybe to be a genuine band we need to be nicer to each other and hang out as buds.  Let's take a noodle break. Come on, it will help!
No! Wait, don't go, too!
Cook?
Mm-hmm. Thanks.
Yeah! Sounds cool, my bud.
Jake, you're back!
Wha?
Oh.  Whaaaa...
One more time?
Alright, time out, guys.
Princess! Princess, wait!
Marceline?
Jake! Everybody! We can beat the Door Lord! ...Together.
It's over, Door Lord.
What's he trying to say?
Ah, yeesh.
Wait, if that's Bubblegum's shirt, what are you missing, Marceline?
Wait a second, wait a second! You don't have a thing! You just wanted to hang out with us!
No way, you're caught! I figured you out!What's so funny?
Dude. That's not that funny.  EAAH!!
Ohhh, butter pranked! I can't believe I didn't see that coming!
You have offended my honor, sir, and in so doing, you have awoken the pranking demon that sleeps in my pits! The demon is coming for you, mortal. It is going to prank you... so... HARD!
That's right, suckah! Go nap it up, for when you awake, the pranking demon will be upon you!   Aww, man! Nothing's better than throwing a big bag of butter at someone!  Gotta think! What's... a better prank... than butter?! Answer me, book! What's better than butter?! A unicorn.  A treasure hunter!  A battleship!  A pie!  A young girl in loWait! Book, rewind!  That's it! I'll throw never-ending pies at Jake's face forever!
It's never-ending pie-throwing time! C'mon, dude! Turn on!  Why isn't it working?!  I'll never make a prank better than Jake's garbage bag full of butter.
Holy stuff! It talked! Wow-cow-chow!
Oh, whoa! Hey, man!
Oh, perfect! You're exactly the kind of robot I was trying to make!
Neptr! Don't say stuff like that! Look, I know we just met, and you're probably goin' through a lot of personal stuff right now, but I really like you, Neptr, and I'm not gonna rest until you're working properly and throwing hot pie on my best friend's face. Together, we're gonna prank the poots out of Jake!
I know you will, Neptr. Now, all we need is more lightning power so you can be operating at full capacity! And I think I know just the dumb-hole who we can get some from.
Heh. No, Neptr. We call that snow.
UNH!  Did y'all smack me into that mountain on purpose?
Take note, Neptr. These guys are grade-A pranksters. You guys hang out in case we need a daring escape!
Just gotta sneak around until we find his lightning bolt stash.
No, we're pranking and entering, which is awesome!
Shush, Neptr!
Shh!
Neptr, you're gonna get us caught!
Shh! You already told me that! And we're not getting caught! We're gonna get you working so you can prank Jake! He could wake up from his nap at any second!
Quickly! While he's distracted!
We're home free, Neptr.
We're gonna prank 'im, Neptr. Hardcore.
Hee hee hee hee!
The ceiling really is melty!  Whoa! Whoa!
WAAAAH!
Figs!
We've gotta find that lightning as fast as
It's a lightning-shaped door! And we're gonna smash right into it! Hold on, Neptr! I got a plan!
Nah, that wasn't my plan. We got lucky!
Mm-hmm. You're gonna be fully functional just like I promised.
Let's grab some lightning and get outta here!
Neptr! NOOOOO!  NOOOOOO!Oh, yeah. That's what we wanted to happen.
Neptr! Yeah!
Neptr! The pies! Pies!
What was in those pies?!
Neptr's acting... different.
Heh heh. You guys got me.
Thanks, guys. Your blood-oath is fulfilled.
Neptr, that's a heavy unsettling thing to say, but pull yourself together. We're about to prank Jake!
One... two...
Run, Neptr!!
Hah! Hah! Hah!  Aw, man.
Your son?!
He's not your son! If anything, he's my son!
No way! Neptr wants to help me prank Jake!
No! Neptr!
No, Neptr!
Come on, Neptr. Choose me, buddy. Choose pranks.
WHAT?! You've gotta be flippin' kidding me!
NEVER!
You wanna prank Jake?
Haha, okay. Let's gooooo!  Jake! Wake up!Yeah, why?
Naw, that's just how I look when I'm listening to music.
Bring it!
Who do you think it is?
Hmm... I can't quite make it out.
Ahh! It's the Ice King!
Eiiiiaah!
Eat my sword, Ice King!
Aww.
I will, though! With a sweet kick!  Psych!
What's the good news?
Eww.
Hmm... if you get married, what about capturing princesses?
Ohhh...  well, fare thee well, Ice King!
We totally support your decision to stop capturing princesses!  I'm happy for him.
But we hate you.
Dude, we gotta show him a good time and treat him right. Otherwise, he'll go back to imprisoning ladies! I-I can't have that! I
Bye, Ice King! Good luck!
No more stealing princesses!
We just took you out partying so that you could feel better about getting hitched!
Alright, here comes my double kick!
Yeah, I remember.
Jake
Well, uh... don't you wanna grow old with somebody? Right?  Just like these old swans.
Uhh... YeahI-I neveruhh... I guess it is.  Jake, this is bad news, man! We gotta go tell him that he can't eat his wife!
Phew!
I'm weddy for the wedding!
Y'know, even though the Ice King is a wad, I'm pretty happy for him.
Weirdand your bride is into that?
Well...  cool, man. I'm glad y'all are happy... being crazy together.
Huh? Her eyes are huge! I'm gonna go check 'em out.  And stop scratching your ear, manit's gross.
Whoa, you've got ridiculously large eyes, princess! Are you allergic to somethin'?
Why are you crying?
What?!
He tricked me! And I was happy for that son of a toot!
That's what cursed her! Don't worry, princess. I'll remove this ring and save your life.
No, man. You cursed her. She hates you!
Hyah!  What is wrong with you, man?!
Ehh.
Huh?
Jake!
JAKE!  Grrrr.  Oh, hey.
You got the ring off her finger?
I got a plan.
Now!
It's official! You done married a dog, dude!
And now everything's back to normal.I can make that driz, no problem.
Naw, that's just a perspectal illusion. It looks far 'cause the cliff's lower.
Whoo! Shoot!
Almost.
What? Watch me, fool!  Hup. WAAAAAAH!
I did it! Psych.  Hey, you know what? This is cool, just having bro time for once.
Or dudes, or whatevs. It's just a chore sometimes.
Whoa.
Looks like they're trying to drown a barn.
Holy fizzle!  What's goin' on here, tough boy?  What is that huge dude?
Whoa!
Oh, my Glob.
Did you just die?
I want bionic legs! Who's your friend?
I don't care about natchy.
You think we can beat him?
But if we beat him, we'll be crazy legends.
Jake, that's your legend. This could be our legend. Brogend!
Train!
No, man, train up, like, get ripped!
We're comin' back for you, the Farm! After we train!
We're gonna annihilate you, the Farm!
I'm gonna do a finishing move on you! Alright! Yeah!   C'mon, Jake!
Hyah! Hyah!
Yes!
Huh?
Jake, you're playing Kompy's Kastle?
Winning this battle could take our reputation to a whole new level!
So, you don't care about fighting the Farm?
Hi-yah!
Ouch.
Never!
And I'm gonna drink it!
Apologize for not taking training seriously!
Huh!
No. You apologize for not taking training seriously.
You! You're the cheap move!
Huh? Pants!  Huh!
I'm really gonna wipe you now.
I'm gonna down the Farm without you.
Yo, guess what? Guess what, homey? I put in the time. I'ma make you mine.
Yeah, that's right. Come and get this.
Just me. I don't need this  clown-town.
Ah! I can't see! Walk me to the light!
Cloud looks like a car.
Whoa. Who are you?
Are you gonna show us a move to beat the Farm?
Alright.
Yeah. Don't you always call sweatpants give-up-on-life pants, Jake?
Yeah, what's this all about?
Ow!
Whoa. That... was a good nap.
Yeah. What was he trying to tell us, exactly?
No, man. It is important. Being the third best at something is math and deserves respect. Not like I did to Kompy. Anyway, I think we both got cranky after all that training.
Yeah. Oh, hey! Look!
A'ight. This is it. Let's use what we learned in training.
Mud in the eyes!
Pull down his pants like you did to moi!
Hm. I think I know what that means.
You ready, man?
Okay.Hey, Jake.
You ever wonder what a demon's heart looks like?
You ever wonder what a demon's heart tastes like?
Heck yeah!
Means he's evil, I guess.
Hey! I want more than just free powers! What else ya got?!
OH! OH! OH!
Right.  I begrudgingly accept your offer.
This place looks magical. You think this is where we get the powers?
Yeah! Are you the guy handing 'em out?
So, where's that guy?
Uh...
Ohhhh...
Yes, we do! Can't wait!
Whoo-hoo!
I'm responsible, dude!
That's a lie!
Hey! This is a dress!
This way I won't be embarrassed!
Mark me, Jake. I shall have that final star!  Where do we start?!
Yeah! Dustomancy! Whatever that is! Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme!
Alright.  Ah, wait!  This is gross!! Man, I can't eat this!
Whoooaaa! You got a star!
Wait, Jake! Don't use 'em until I finish my broom!   Last... bite...
WE'RE DUSTOMANCERS!  Nothing happened! This is a total ripoff!! Bufo! You tricked us! Stupid power doesn't even work!!
I'm doing this? So... I have
Sorta cool?!? THIS IS RADICAL!
We get more?!
Nope... Not at all.
Eyeballs?!
Another star! Yeah! Shadowcery...  Onward, my shadow steed!  Huh?
Wizard powers are so cool... I want ALL THE STAR BADGES!!!
All we're missing now is the big star! You ready to complete the set, man?
WHAT?! How can you stop now??
What's that?
Aw... What a lame-o.  Bufo! I'm ready to get that big star!
Wha?? You can't do this to me, man! I've got no money!
Okay. I'll take that pledge.
I'm ready!
Just let me take that pledge, man!
That's it?  Easy!  Huh?  My big star!! Yes!! Wha-hoo! Yeah!! Wait, where am I?
Huh?  Is that an asteroid heading for this very temple?
Oh, okay.  Whoa! I got it! Now what?
Awesome. ... Wait, what?!
This is what all the wizard training was about?!  You tricked me!
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
Aw, man, this sucks.  Old people! There's gotta be a better way!
Yeah? I've got a younger idea!
Youth culture forever!  Whoa.
Sleep!
Ultimate Wizardry, activate!  ...Uh... Hm. Maybe my footing's off?  There you go!  I cast... Dragon Eyes! Tiger Claw! Vorpal Hand! Blazing Feet! Beauteous Wings! And finally... every other power I didn't mention by naaaame! With all my magics combined, I'm powerful enough to move the entire village out of the asteroid's path!   I need some help! Jake!! Awaken!!
Hah... My stupid young idea will be responsible for hundreds of deaths!
Huh? Old wizards! You ditched your responsibilities to help me!
Oh, okay, um, since you're here already, could you lend me a hand??
Whoo-hoo! Nice job! Thanks to us, the village is saved. And we reclaimed a few of your twilight years!
No way! Your plan was to dupe a succession of rubes into keeping the asteroid at bay!
Chill, man. You don't have to quit your job.
Nah. Just don't take credit for ideas that aren't yours.
Aw, ha ha ha haw, yeah!Jake.
Wizard Battle is starting soon!
The wizards are arriving!
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!!!
Whoo, wizard only allowed! Whoo. Whoo. Wh-... Oh, what? Ice King!
You're a contestant?!
Phshoo, you're gonna lose, man.
Jake, we gotta enter the contest and stop Ice King.
I'd rather sanctify PB's lips.
No! I wanna save the princess!
I do!
Oh, shush!
Now, where's the Ice King.
We need a plan, man.
What are they waiting for?
Huh?
And are you a wizard?
Hi, Abracadaniel. My name is, uh, Magic...  Fist.
He's my, uh, magic second head.
You mean, you don't care about kissing PB?
Wait! Abracadanny, don't you worry about a thing. I'm gonna protect you.
Yeah, man. Also, I have an idea for how you can help me save PB's lips.
Cheating!
He's using a weapon!
Now's my chance to stop him.
Huwahh?!
No!  Jake, two o' clock!
Okay, now to stop the  Ice Kiiing...?
Whoa! That's turbo amazing!
Stay close to me, Abracadaniel.
Quick, listen! Now's the time for you to help me.
Watch out, man.
You got this, Danny boy!
Good job, Danny. You're not a wimp anymore. You should feel pretty good.
I'm gonna forfeit now. I only wanted to stop the Ice King.
I forfeit! I forfeit, everyone!
Meow.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
What?
Yeah, okay! I want to kiss her, alright? You got me! The big secret is out! Okay, Jake. I like Princess Bubblegum! ARE YOU HAPPY, JAKE?!
Whoa, Jake. Don't cry, man. I'm not really mad at you.
I'm just sick of having to hide my feelings all the driz. It's exhausting.
Heh heh. Yeah, alright, man.
Yeah, I'm coming!
Ooh, whoa!
Oh, dag.
Uh, Ice King was cheating his way through Wizard Battle using nun-chucks, so Jake and I faked being wizards to save you from having to kiss him and we uh,  I dishonored Wizard Battle.
Heh heh, oh, well.
Thanks, man. My face hurts a little.
Thanks, dude.  Here, you try 'em.
So fly.How is he?
Yeah, prubs, give him the medicon.
Nope. Wizards only.
Trespassers get killed mad quick, like zap-zap.
Let's stay home. Just kidding.
This is it?
Well, what's with the wall?
What's over there?
But we can trick it, right?
Don't know, man. I give up.
Yeah, I'm no good at this!  Unh! Oof!
Whoa.  Powerful magicks.
Entanglement is a spell where you get trapped in tree roots, and sometimes they spike out and hook your flesh, and you got to be like, My body is clay, my spirit feels no pain. Then you chop your way out and kill the wizard!
These signs are weird. Let's ask somebody. Hey, dudes.  Yo, where's the--
Yeesh. Okay. Who are these guys?
Oh, my shrah!
You saw that, right?
No, wait!
Hey, Jake?
Is PB straight-up naked right now?
Dude, it's me, Finn! Quick, let us in!
Come on, man!
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Just let us rest for a bit.
Shush!
Ugh! That's sick!
Ugh!
I got traumatized by those underpanties.  This sucks.
Hey, PB, are you okay?
PB! Over here!
Whoa!
What?! Are you two crazy?!
Jake, we have to do something!
We need to get out of this.
All this for a cold spell.  What the-? Ice?  Hmm.
Peebs! Incoming!
It's a cold spell, not a cold spell.
Get down!
Your magicks are powerful, PB.
Poor Starchie. All that trouble and we couldn't get any magic for him.Crunchy, you look like a rainbow! It's beautiful! Can you guys see that?
The aura's gone!
I wanna see Peppermint Butler's aura!
Yeah, we do! Right, Princess?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, me and Jake, we gotta peace out.
Hey- what's goin' on in here? Yo, guys!
Whoa, what's that? Security cams?
Oh, yeah! That's, uh... Who is that?
Who's that?
WAAAAAAAAAAAAUH! Lemongrab! What the?
What are we gonna do?
Dude! You didn't have to do that...
Buncha bad apples!
No sign of Lemongrab for three days! I think it worked!
Man, that guy's a real D-list!
Let's crush this mess all accordingly!
Yeah!
Okay, that's cool, too.
C'mon! Let's find the Pup Gang quick!
Okay, cool!
What do you got, Jake?
...Weird.
Whoa!
