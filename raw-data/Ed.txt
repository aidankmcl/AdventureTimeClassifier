No, I'm just tired of setting traps all day, solo-style.
I just said I was tired.
I'm not mad. Oh, look, food... that I caught... in my web... for us.
Yeah, I know.
Well, go ahead then. Wrap them up for laters.  What's wrong, Barb?
What?
Uhh... I uh... You tell me, you don't find me gross!
Yeah, I guess, but she never does it in front of me.  Anyway, it's not gross when guys do it.
How about how she affects me? I love her, man.
Can someone tell me why we fight, why she treats me like all I do is make her feel bad? Tell me, Glob, why don't you ever answer me!?
What?
I don't real-talk with my food.
Yeah, right. You just wanna get out of my web. All you ever want to do is escape! You're always, like, in cahoots, makin' plans not to be food.
So okay, eat your friend here.
Okay, man, you've earned my trust. So, let's do this. Real-talk me, bro!
Ugh, yeah. It's not working. My way sucks.
Yes, heal the neg-jerseys in me.
Yeah, I can find her a present. If you think that'll help. I don't think it will, but what do I know, I'm just a big ol' dummy who does everything wrong...
Get her a present. Harumph. When was the last time she got me a present? What would she want, anyway? How do I know, we never talk. Jeez, what happened to my life? All my friends are gone. They all got kids now. I don't have kids. All I have is Barb. And she...  treats me like a--a dingus! Wha... Oh, cool! A sword!  Wow, neat!  It's magic or something! We can hang this up over our mantle and snuggle by the fire, huh, like we--like we used to! I'm gonna fix us, Barb! Fix us!
Barb! Barb!
Barb, look! Damage control! Check it out! I wrapped it up and everything!
Yeah! Come on, open it!
It's a sword! I found it in the woods!
Yeah, it's magical, though. Check out the blade!
No, I got it for us! For snuggles by the fire!
Oh, really? Well, I guess we're never gonna eat again either 'cause I catch the food, and your butt is dysfunctional! Eeh-ya!  Go! Run away, food! We don't need you apparently!
Now what are you gonna eat? Huh, Barb?
Oh, help, somebody help me!
Mercy!
Barb! Barb! What's wrong, my love?  Okay ...
I think there's hope for us, Barb.
