As a first-time recruit, I'm confident that you have no idea what you're doing here.
Let's take a look at your file.  Ahh, you're a fighter!  We could use a fighter.
What? Of course it does. Let me explain. You have gone dentist. That means that you will server a brief tour of duty, and in exchange we will provide full dental rehabilitation. You will be on the front, fighting monsters. Monstrous monster worms!
The worms are employed by the flies.
Work for the flies. You fight them; we'll fix your teeth.
Yes, you!  Your mission is to secure this junction at all costs. Upon completion of service, you will be sworn to absolute secrecy. The flies have spies everywhere. Fly spies!
These worms are no joke, so you'll be assigned a partner. Ah, let's see... Cadet... Tiffany Oiler.
Tough nuts, that's dentist.
Whoa! Easy, son. Don't try to speak. Your mouth is full of ants.
Well, the good news is the worm queen was defeated, choked to death on some foreign object, presumably Cadet Tiffany, who is missing in action, which is the bad news.
But we didn't have to fix his teeth, which is nice news. But we did have to fix your teeth, which is okay news.
So, on behalf of the ant nation, I'd like to thank you for your service, which is now concluded. As soon as you're ready, we'll get you stuffed back up there well with all the snakes and butter.
