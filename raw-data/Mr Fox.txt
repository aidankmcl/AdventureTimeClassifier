My end... table, my love seat, yeah. Gee but it's great to be back home. It's always a blast visiting my cousin, city-Fox, at his future palace, but you just can't beat that old country steez. City-Fox's digs be mad sterile. Look a this. This was my grandpa's rug. Some bums let him have it 'cause it was so ugly.   And check out these classic stylings. They don't make 'em like this anymore!  Wow! Haha! Almost got me right in my both eyes!  Look at my bugs.  Man, I always did have the ugliest bugs. What are they doing? Selling each other houses?
Yes, siree, there's some things money can't buy.  You see that depression? You can't buy that, you gotta earn it. Boy, it's like I can almost see myself sleeping in there.   Wha?  Dear conscious self, I know where some buried treasure is. I'll draw you a map. Love, subconscious self. Oh my gosh, I'm gonna be rich!
What the?  Oh, no! My riches!
Cinnamon Bun, you!  Did a great job, on this hole wall. It's very rustic.Mmm, Boobafinna, just pay me back when you can.Hey, free book.
Hey! Hey everybody look! Look at this book I found about eating babies!  They just sit there while you eat them.
I don't know, but I'm going to go eat one right now.
Look, fellas, there's never gonna be a perfect baby. Times like this ya just gotta dive right in.Uh!
Yeah, what's this friend's  name, huh?
Yeah, right. Sounds pretty fake. C'mon, Boobafina, let's get out of here.
Would you eat dirt?
Let's go.
Ah, wait!!!
Oh no, oh no! I really did want to kiss Boobafina! I'm secretly in love with her!
No, no. It had to happen naturally! Now she'll never love me!
It's true... it's for the best.
Yo, put that bag back on.
