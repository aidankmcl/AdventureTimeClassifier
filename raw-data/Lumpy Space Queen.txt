We can't find our baby girl!
How are the sandwiches?
We want you to move back home, sweetheart.Son, come here at once!
Why aren't you working on your monster exercises?
You will eat them!
Sharpen your teeth!
Eat those worms and sharpen those teeth!
Son!
Silence!
You must obey!
Submit young one, become a true monster.
Silence!
Thank you son! You freed us from adult mediocrity and fatuousness.WHAT DID YOU SAY?! What did you just say?!?
