Hey, Princess!
Remember that time last summer when you said you'd only go out on a date with me if I was the last guy on Ooo?
Anyone having any...  computer problems?
E-ha-ha-ha-ha! My worm exists beyond your comprehension within the universal source code...
Once the glitch does its work, the whole world will be deleted! Except for me and my Bubblygums.  Ow!! Well, see y'all! I'm gonna prepare for my... date. Ahaha!
Oh, Princess Bubblegum? Guess who? Can you guess? Can you? I'll give you 3 chances.
OK, four chances.
But sugar, look what I brought you! A box of chocos!  Hm... Still good.  Argh. Look, I can't prove it, but...  ...you made a promise we'd have at least one date if...  ...if I was the last person on Ooo...  You promised...
Well, uh... Ooh, I-I have a hand too, y'know? I can lend you one...  Check out my cool hand!
Grrrr!!!
Oh, come on, woman, I'm trying to be nice! Can't you at least make the best out of this?  Are you praying to me? I'm into this.  ...I'm still into this.  Still into it.
I can't, monkey peeps, I didn't make one! The glitch will delete everything until we're all that's last!
Well, yeah! I mean, you say that like it's a bad thing.
Huh? No way! Impossible!  Uh...
Uh... guys? Hello? Princess. Uh... Let's forget all about this...  Ugh get off of me, you creep! Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!Heh? Stop meddling, boy! You and your magical dog can't harm me.
I'm going to make one marry me!
Your hat is stupid!
Now I've got you, boy!
Heh?
Nwah. How dare they trifle with me. They can't possibly think they can win!
Wha?
Fool! Your powers are no match for my magical crown!
My powers! Foul and noisome whelp! You've not seen the last of my wintery fangs! I'll cleave the warmth from your bones and stop still your beating heart with my claaaaws...Yeeargh! How long has this been in here? I don't even remember buying this. Oh welleasy come, easy go.  Goodbye! Well, that wasn't so bad.   Hm.
Ah! Nothing like a hard day's work to get them spirits a-lifted!
Great news, fellas! I finished all my chores, so we can start movie night early. Take your sits and will reveal the nominees. We got Baby Ballet, Blimby's WHO GOTS DA ABC'S, Airplanes Taking Off,   Oh, wait! What's this one? Basic Mortality: Season 1!? Isn't this that show that everyone is talking about? I heard that this show is really good for penguins. Wow, that's really lucky for you guys, I'm a little jealous. Well anyway, good luck to all our nominees! OK, all in favor of Blimby's WHO GOTS DA ABC'Sraise your hands.
OK, all in favor of Baby Balletraise your hands.
OK, all in favor of AirWhat!? Baby Ballet? Ugh! Come on! I should have never given you penguins the right to vote. Well, you may have numbers on your side, but I still have one trick up my sleeve. Bargaining. Whereby, you let me watch Basic Mortality, and I in return will do anything you want in the whole world. How 'bout it?
Algebraic!
I don't know about this show though
might be a touch too dark.Yeah, I guess there's some cool people here, musics a little loud but the but the punch is top-drawer.
Hey, you should come to one of my parties sometime; I'm friends with some pretty cool people too you know?
Oh, uh- like that guy, Finn.
Yeah, Finn and I are pretty tight!
That's me, ice-dude. . Hey, have you ever seen the inside of an ice bear cave?
Yeah, yeah, now scram.
So I guess you're more into the 'little brother-type'? Huh.
Ice?! I'll give you ice!  Oh, looks like I put this party- on ice. Oh wait, you want ice? You, oh, you got iced!  Anyway, oh, don't look at me like that Lauren. . Eh, this party was weak anyway.You've been acting like a real knucklehead, Doctor Prince. Go on, get out of here! And don't ever do wrong things again!
Oh, Ice King. I'm such a great guy! This book is yours...
Let's have a best and closest friend lunch! It's mac'n'cheezles!
I'm just so glad you guys are real... you're really, really real! I wanna remember this day forever!
Weehee hee!
Hm? Wha?
Oh, come on! It's a first draft... don't hate! And besides, that story had everything. Action, adventure, a hotter, older guy... Wildberry, don't pretend; I know you like the silver foxes.
Real? It's based on the real Fionna and Cake!
Y'all are just hatin' on my steeze! I'm not listening to haters. Haters!
What the...? Whoa oh... I'm sorry I didn't think you were real, Gob... but now I've seen your power, and I've got some things that I did that I have to say sorry for.
Marceline, how long have you been in here?
Oh, so you heard my story, then... Awesome, right?
Oh, come on! You guys got mad at me for a bad story? I mean it's cute, but... that's not how'd they be! But look, it might not be too late to polish this piece offlet's spitball off some ideas. Like, if Marshall Lee gets sick and dies, but he's got a brother we didn't know about! His name's Marshall Lee...roy. Boom, shocker!  Uh-huh! I feel goosebumps!
Everyone get out...  I know you're out there somewhere... I just haven't figured out how to get to you... but believe me, I will! I will...Oh, this striz is going down, man.
And mine!
Listen, dudes, all I want is to be in the club and plus up my magic. What's the problem?
Eh, why not, again?
Where's my Betty? Where's my princess?! Princess! Princess!!
Uh, huh?
This a party? Huh?
Whoa! Heh. Okay. Whoopee!
So then, Ron James told me this girl I was with flew into Bella Noche and mysteriously defeated it for me! Wow!
Just my luck, right? Black out for a day and meet the woman of your dreams.
Hey, don't be jealous, Muscle Princess. She's gonekablooey. Let's be realistic, right? We both know you're not my top pick.
Oh, Grod!
No!
Aaah! Go home! You can go! Aah!Leaf Princess!  Come to me, my arboreal beauty! Gotcha!
I know, but it's mine.
Yes... Why? Are you makin' fun of me or something?
Ohhhh, yeah.... You're trapped in the Spirit Realm. I can see all things Spirit with my... Wizard Eyes!
Oh, yeah, I know all the ins and outs. And I'd do anything for a friend like you.
Quiet, Gunter. Can'tya see I'm hanging with Finn?
I know I say that a lot, but this time it's true!
Oh, there are portals all over the universe. I have one in my basement! Every once in a while, a real cutie pie drifts through. Ooh!  Oh, gosh, there she is.  Mm, oh, yeah...
What? I swear I never touch 'em! I can't!  Can't touch this, can't touch this...  Can't touch this, either.  Yep, I can't kill any of them.   I hate them... Okay, alright! 'Nuff messin' around. Let's getcha free from the Spirit Plane.
Sooo, the only way to get out of the Spirit World is to stick all these lousy things in the Spirit Hole down there. Then plug up the hole with that.
Mm-hmmmm, trust me! We are tur-bros! Turbo bros! Tur-bros. Turbo. ...Bros.
Ohhh, that's not all of 'em. There's this other guy that watches me. He's... super creepy.  Do ya see it?? Oh, it see's you...  Catch it and put it in the Spirit Hole! In the Spirit Hole where it can't see me anymore so you can be free!!  Get it! Get it!!  GET IT IN THE HOLE!!
Yes! It's gone!
Uhhh, wait, though.
There's this last guy you gotta get. He's pretty much the worst. He usually leaves these gross heads around, but I'm not seeing them anywhe OH!  THERE IT IS! THERE IT IS!!
Nooo...
NO! DON'T COME NEAR ME!!
It's from the dead one. He leaves these heads around everywhere. I can't even touch them, but it still creeps me out...
Please get rid of him!
USE THE HEADS!! Oh, snow, please!
Ha ha, Finn! You fell right into for my brilliant plan  that I formed out of the thin air like a true Magi! Not only did I get you to remove those horrible creatures from my castle, but now you're trapped, and only I can see you. So if you want friends, this is it, pal!
NO, WAIT, MY PLAN FELL APART!!  My... new plan is that you don't open the hole, and I destroy the porcelain lamb which will bring you back to the material plane. Heh heh... heh.
Jake.  AGH, BLUH! GIMME THAT LAMB!
That's why I have to smash it!!
Escaped!  AAAH! My winter body!! I was gonna start up on the elliptical again, but I got depressed, okay?! Don't look at me!!
AAH! They're touching me for real! EWW!!
FINN, GIVE ME YOUR CLOTHES!
I need a buffer!! AAAH!
I'm sorry... I'm sorry, they were just touching me on the body... I'm sorry...
Cooool. Whaddaya think, Finn? Can we pull back the veil of static and reach into the source of all being? Behind this curtain of patterns... this random pattern generator... So clever... right here in every home, watching us from a one-sided mirror...  Heh heh heh, whoops! Just wizard-talkin' to myself!
Yeah, a'ight. You mean like this?
Okay! Wha-zah!!Huh? Who could that be?
What?! No one commands the Ice King to make no sandwich!
Okay.Jeez, you couldn't wait two seconds?
Didn't you get my text? It said I'm stayin'  with you guys oh, didn't go through. Well, anyways, I knew you wouldn't mind since it's sorta your fault I'm homeless, right?
'Cause you tricked your crazy ex into meltin' my Ice Kingdom?
With your lies and secrets? 'Member when that happened?
Yeah, I'm just crashing here while the penguins rebuild. I've given Gunter temporary reign.
Should be fine.
You're blind, Finn. You're blindwait, she isn't here, is she?
Whew!
Yeesh.
Heh, yeah, like, remember how you and I were married?Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, noooooo! . Mornin'. Man, what a dream. Do you guys ever have the dino-boy dream with the astero-- what? What... what is it?  Something in my teeth? Something in my hair? Something in my nose? Something in my ear?to marry him! said Fionna. Then she turned to Prince Gumball and said, I hope Ice King will sweep me off my feet and take me to the farthest corner of Ooo, where we will do nothing but kiss and eat a whole bunch until we get fat and die. The end. So, what do you think of the fanfiction I wrote about you guys?
Tell me you thought it was good!Family meeting! Family meeting gather round.  Things are gonna change around here very soon! Youre gonna have a new mommy to help BOSS ya around! Well, I mean- I havent exactly asked her yet. Welp! No time like the present!  Ya deh deh duh duh duh deh. Sweetie, are you awake?  Great! Because I have a query Ive been meaning to inquire of you.  Well, uh.  When two people, eh- will- Will you marry me!  Oh yah!  Yes! Yes drink up the tears! Drink up those good luck tears!  No, not you Gunter! Youre on a low-salt diet! Huh?  Uh-a-whats that dear? Oh! I almost forgot!  Do do-do do-Do!  Its a wife ring!  This ones for me. Im the husband. That means I get the remote control THREE days a week and you get it four!   Ahhh, Sweetie, this is bliss. It feels so math to finally be normal. Not like those two freaks.  What are they doin over there? Anyway! I-oh, whos that?  Oh. Oh my.Blegh, Gunter, something stinks!  Gunter, do you smell that?  GUNTER, STOP PLAYING THE KEYBOARD!!  Smells like it's comin' from...  Gunter, are you blowin' it up in here?  You are nasty, Gunter! You got a nasty booty, mister! Nasty!  Oh, don't be sad, stinky. Come with daddy and I'll make it aaaall better.
Goodbye, Gunter. Sorry, sweetie, but I'm never gonna get any princesses if you're stinkin' up the place!  Blaaaah, it still stinks in here! What the heck! Where's that smell comin' from?!  Oh, it's me. I smell horrible.
Scrub, penguins! Scrub harder! We are not stopping until the stench is completely gone!
Clean clean, clean ka-clean.  Gunter! Guess what? It was me who was smelly, not you!
Sorry. I thought you had a stank booty, Gunter. My bad. Although I have no idea how my armpits got so stinky.Hey!  You two should get a room! You and that log! Not you and Finn. 'Cause you're huggin' a log, you weirdo!
Hey now, stay away from me! Shoo shoo!
Oh, so you wanna get real, do ya? Well, check this! You seeing this?
Ow! My hams!
Oh, hey, kids! Fine day for a picnic.
Uh, what? What did I say?
Look, just take whatever you want. Okay? Take it all!  It's all just prunes! Prunes and liver! Frozen, of course.
Ah. You might have what it takes to slap these old jowls, but do you have what it takes to face my- just a second...  Legion of Snow Warriors?! Go, fight! Protect me!  Oh, boy.
Woah!
Oh, man. Times! I call time!
We're totes cool! I-I'm Ice King!
Respect? I got all kinds of respect!
Smirk? I smirk when I'm nervous.
And also when I'm about to win!  Booyah!  And I didn't even get to test out my new fire-proof grundies!
What?
Ooh, beard mail!  Dear Ice King, you're not funny, you're old, and no princess will ever marry you ever, simple Simon.  Oh, fight.
Not my beard!
Ice...the King!
How's about some of this?
Oh beans, oh beans, oh beans!
Finn!
Help Gunter. Please!  I meant after you saved me.
Oh! That's right, carry me like a princess.
Ice.  Whatever.
What?
You blew it, man.Good morning, Breakfast Princesses.
That's why I'm using honey.
What? You can't do that!
You're grounded for two weeks!
Why? I didn't do anything.
Fine. But I'm only gonna do it for a week.
Okay.  What's up with the peace sign?
This is so unfair! They're the ones who should be grounded. Not me!  I'm so mad! I could just hit them! If only I could hit them without leaving the castle.   H...I...T...M...A...N.  Ooh! [A profile pops up. It is the Scorcher's profile. It reads:
Perfect.
Whoa, you are fast.  And quiet.  And very good at dramatic silence. I like it.  Alright, so, how do we do this? We shake hands or...  Oh-ho, paperwork!   Finn and Jake.  Whoosh!  A-ha, there he is. Huh? What's he doing?  What the?! I hired a hitman, not a fireman!
You guys, I
Okay, okay. Goll.
Sheesh, this Scorcher guy's got some weird ideas about hitting.
Hey, there you are! What's that? I already signed that.  I thought I told you to hit them, not burn them alive! You big dummy! Goll! It's almost like you want to kill them! Lucky for them, I stopped the fire!  You know what happens when you're burned alive?! Your eyeballs explode! Bleh!  Hey wha?
Ice wind! Blow! Blow! Blow!
Finn and Jake, I am just a dream. I was never here...
Okay, mister, you are really trying my patience. How clear can I be?! All I want you to do is hit them. On the shoulder or something.  Are you even listening? Oh, I get it.  Here's double the grease to not kill Finn and Jake.  You trying to hustle me, Scorcher? Okay, I'll play this game. How about this prized piece for your pad?   No! Okay, how about these bad boys? Night-vision x-ray goggles. For when you have a lady house-guest.  Oh, come on!  At least renegotiate the target! You can destroy my least favorite princesses.  What about Lumpy Space Princess?  Ghost Princess?  I can't even hold her with my love mitts.  Aw, geez! Uh...  Oh! AA leg cramp! In my leg! Ow, ow, ow.  Oh, this is so embarrassing. I'll be right back!   Ow, ow, ow!  Huh. Think, baby, come on. Ah!  Alright, let's hit the hitman, right? There's gotta be a  Ah! [A profile for 'Blastronaut' comes up. It reads:
Blastronaut. #1 solution for all Hitman problems. Sheesh, 99.95? That's nuts.   Scorcher.
Sweet!
No! Come back, you wussy!  Ooh, that was weird.  Was that your friend, or something?  Look, a super model! Look, a hover-board! Look, the apocalypse! Someone got hit in the boing-loins! Hit in the boing-loins!  Boing-loins! Boing-loins. Somebody got hit in them.  Peace out!
Freakin' butt! Butt, butt, butt!
I know, but shush!
Okay, I hired a guy to kill you by accident.
I thought he was going to just hit you in the gut and make you spit up your lunch.  Well, I froze him in ice, but I think he's free now 'cause he's made out of fire. Or he commands fire, maybe?
You alive?
Whew! That was close.
Ooh, got it! I'm gonna kill you guys!
No, wait a minute, you two. I won't actually kill you. I'm just gonna lower your body temperatures so you seem dead. And after we fool that fool outside, I'll warm you up, good as new.
You'll thank me later.
Stop! Time out! You don't need to do this anymore! Look! They're dead! I killed them myself!  Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead! They're dead. No pulses.
So, uh, looks like, you can go home now.
Oh, yes, of course.  There. [The Scorcher burns the contract and disappears in a black vapor. He leaves a paper that reads:
Oh, glad all that's over.  Hey, guys, guess what? You're grounded. Underneath my butt!Evil tapes! Evil!
You're evil, tapes! Full of evil secrets! That's why I'm going to bury you where no one will ever find you... under all these boogers!  Wee, hahahahaha! Wee, hahahaha!
Hello, dear diary. Pretty good day so far. Got up bright and early and had a healthy and slimming breakfast, did fourteen minutes of cardio and then I finally got around to...
...I mean, I'm not gonna win carpenter of the year or anything, but it's a place to hang up the old toothbrush.
Gunther? Hey, Gunther. Get-get away from the camera, sweetie. Papa's recording his innermost thoughts. 'Member? I explained this to you?  Hey, Gunther?  GUNTHER!!!
Well, anyway, as you can see, I'm not wearing my
I'm not wearing my
Sweetie, I raised my voice because you were giving me the silent treatment. You understand?
I love you.
There must be more to life than this...
I know. You don't like when I'm contemplative. ...C-contemplative... No, con-temp-laLet's put on a play!
Oh, Ice King! You're so cool! You take such good care of yourself! I wanna be with you!
No, Gunther, beard stays on.
Gunther, I need ya to wear the beard!
Gunther!
Now hold still...  You moved! Hey, what's this?  Secret tapes?! I wanna watch! I'll catch ya later, Gunther!
Gunther, no! Gunther...  Dance pa  GUNTHER!  Dance party!
Oh, fine! Who needs you? More dance party for us, right, Gunther?  Oh... Eh...  May I have this dance? Heh!
Hey, guys, it's me. Can I come in and watch the secret tapes with you? I brought some gifts!
Eh... No one's home. Guess I'll go away.
Huh?
Hmm. That sounds like BMO!
Oh, diary! Thank you for listening to me!
So there we are. Turtle Princess is frozen and in my little ice wheelbarrow, and there was... magic in the air. We were both feeling it.  But before I could leave the library, Finn and Jake show up. You know how Jake is. Stretch this, stretch that, bah! He knocks off my crown and then Finn bonks me on the nose. Still hurts, too. The worst part is Turtle Princess took away my library card!  You know, dear diary, I'm starting to worry that all these entries sound exactly the same, and that my life is just me running in place on some... giant hamster wheel.
Come on, baby... in the pocket...  I can't do it...
Hello, Finny.
Must be a bad connection. That's why we were disconnected earlier on the telephone.
Oh, the usual. There's ice everywhere and it smells like penguins!
How did you
I wanna watch secret tapes with you guys. It'll be nice.
But
Oh... Fine. No more nice. NOW YOU GET ICE!!  Try watching those tapes with FROZEN EYEBALLS!Agh... What's on those tapes...? I can kinda... make it out... Dang it, BMO, just turn to your right a little.... Ugh!! By the power of ice... I want your cup of cocoa to fall over.  Yes! Now turn and pick it up...  Yes... Yes...  That's... me?  THEY'RE WATCHING MY SECRET TAPES?!  And they're cozy. I'll show them.  This snowman looks pretty good.  Pretty darn good!
Could I have five more minutes, please?
Some of you won't survive this. You'll melt or split in half or your head will fall off... but that's fine... because you're made of snow. Only one thing matters today! Getting into that tree house, getting my tapes back, and beating up Finn and Jake!  Maybe BMO. Yeah, BMO too! Who's with me?!  Hey, why're you guys so quiet? Are you mad?  Oh, that's right. You're not alive yet. My bad.
Gimme my tapes back.
Snowmen! Attack!
Good morning. You're watching the evening news. There's been an unfortunate event. Let's go talk to some witnesses.  Princess, what is your name?
So, Princess Please-let-me-go-home, what was it like to experience this tragedy?
Yeah, we're on air, honey, so spit it out.
Obviously traumatized and in a state of shock. Let's go ask somebody else something.  Upside-down Princess, do you think things will change politically because of today's events?
Well, there ya have it, folks. People are very upset that Gunther tried to eat Ice King's socks! Very upset! That's why Gunther has to stay in the corner!
Ah... The element of surprise... Ah, jeez, I'm filthy.  Well, now I'm cleaner, but I'm also nakeder.  Ohh! Mmm...  Just what I need...  Hehehehe...  Come on, come on!
They wouldn't be in the fruit bowl!  Ohhh! Well, look at you with your nose shining so bright! You're so unique! Hehe! I'll name you Red-nose, and make you leader of the pack!  Eh... Well, now you look boring.  You want somethin' done right, ya gotta do it yourself.
Now gimme my evil tapes back!! They're supposed to be buried!! In the ground!!  Snow goons!!
No, BMO, please don't play it.
Oh, no! Turn it off, BMO, turn it off!!
Now you know my secret! You know... that I used to wear glasses!  Maybe kidnapping Wildberry Princess will cheer me up.
What's this? You're giving me... a gift.
But it's not even my birthday! This is so exciting!  Video tapes! Heh, you know, I had a bunch of these once, but I threw them away! This is great, Finn! Thank you!
Oh! I have presents for you guys, too!  Here. It's a small pine tree. I chopped it down in one foul swoop! And this  is for you!
Oh, isn't this fun?! We're giving each other presents, we're wearing silly clothes, there's snow everywhere... Let's do this every day!
Okay, that sounds good.Okay, Gunter! You ready for the show to begin?!
One, two, three...   Gunter!    It's rhetorical, Gunter. Marceline's songs are so good! Mmm... Maybe I can get Marceline to write a song with me!  Man, if she helped me write a song like that, I'd be crushin' it nonstop with the princesses! Ooh, yeah!  Heh! Gunter, you cute little dummy. You know, Gunter, my song is gonna need some dope lyrics to lure the honeys in. Hmm.
Jay T. Doggzone always says, Ladies are drawn to bros with tortured pasts. And I've got a way tortured past! ...I think. I don't really... re...  Hmm.  Quickly, Gunter! To the The Past room!
Lot of emotional, powerful stuff in here.  Still wet with tears... I'll take some-a' these for lyrical inspiration.  So where's Marceline living these days?
A cave??
Hello? Anybody home?
Uh, yeah, I know, but... I was hoping you could help me write a songone that could help me get some princess action.
Come on! We could be a prog rock duo! I'll even split the fans with you. I get the princesses, and you get... whatever it is you're into. Sounds good, yeah, I think it does!  Ee-yoop!
Eh...
Wait! Just let me play you what I've written so far!   Oh. Dang it. Tangles in the cord. Sometimes this happens when you fly with it... Tangles are hard...  Oh. Aw, aw, geez, no... Oh, no.  Ice King's in trouble.    Hey, you know what? I'll just hum it for ya.  Is that good?
Yeah, Wha?!
You know, I kinda like bein' tied up in these cords. Kinda freak-aaaayyy!
Ooh. I brought these  for some inspiration. Just use these to work off of. Y'know, a template.
Yeah. Yeah, that's good! Keep doin' that!   Slime Princess, you're alright. Flame Princess, you're okay. Wildberry Princess could be better. All of the princesses are pretty alright, but... Oh, Bubblegum! You look like a lot of fun! I'm right outside, and that is how I know! Hey, princess, did you get my text with a picture of my awesome gun show? I'm also workin' on my pecs! If you like, I'll send a picture of that, too! Oh, Bubblegum!  I really need someone.  Or anyone!  ...Pretty much anyone. I'm so alone!  Won't somebody tell me what's wrong with me?!  Anybody!  Anybody!   Anybody!!!  Grod in the sky, please tell me why!!!
No, it's just startin' to get good!!  Anybody!!  Princesses, I command you, love me!! Love me!! Love me!!  Love me!!
I JUST WANNA BE LOVED!!  Uh-oh. I'm sorry I pushed you.  Uh... oh... I'll just stay out of your way.  Again, I'm sorry I pushed you.
Whatcha got? An apple?
Hold on!  Do you... like me?!
Really? ...Wow.  How about...  one of these?  Ah!  Mwah, mwah, mwah...
What-mon?
Yes, I do! I am a lyricist!  It's all here! On the page! The page in song, baby! On this receipt! On this takeout menu! On these newspapers!
Huh?  Heh?
Ooh, ooh, are they good lyrics?  I'll get the keyboard!
Yeah, let's go! What's it say? Sing out, sister!
Ooh, yeah! Keep it going!
Wow! I wrote that?! Hot stuff!
Marceline, I can feel myself slipping away. I can't remember what it made me say... but I remember that I saw you frown. I swear, it wasn't me. It was the crown.  This magic keeps meGunter! Who told you you could fly?!
Huh? No one sucks the life from my penguins except me! ...And maybe polar bears, because that's just nature, Gunter.  You darest encroach upon my domain?!  You've raised my frosty dander! And for that, I shall  AAAAAOOOOOHHH!! I've soiled my tunic... completely by choice!Oh Honey, I told you, you can take the sign off when you tell me where you hid daddy's crown jewels.
Gunter! Huh?  Woo wowsers!Fionna, Cake, I need your help!
I really did it this time! They're loose, and they're coming for us!This is total bunk! You copier! You're only in love with her because I'm in love with her!
I've been playing this game a lot longer than you, pal! I've been workin' my moves, smooth-talkin' 'er, showin' 'er magic tricks! Don't ignore me! Come back!
Hey.
It hurt, ooh, boy! How about a hug? Gimme a hug! I need it!  Oh!
Hey, Finn.  Hee hee!
Coochie coochie coochie!
Hahaha! Shooka shooka shooka!
Ah-hay!!I'll do it!
Psst!
You call this a room? There's not even a window. Oh, wait. Are we rolling?Huh eh! What was that?!  Darling, are you alright? I thought I heard a-  Oh, I see what happened, she broke up with me.  Well it's your mistake missy, this ice king is gonna be fine!
Why did she leave? I put so much cool stuff in her little prison! Come on, old boy, keep it together  Hey, maybe she called me!  Please, please, please! Doo-doo.... doo, doo-doo, doo-doo. No new messages?!  Raaaaa!!
This is where she use to do her business. Uh, I'm so tired of looking at this face.  Aa, hee hee, not bad! And now for some healthy exercise! Ha ha, I'm forgetting about that silly old break up already!
Alright, let's fly!  Oof! You fool, you can't fly without your beard.  I'm gonna be alone forever.
Beautiful princess.
That's funny, usually my looks put people off.
Is someone paying you to do this?
Well, there's not much to tell, really. I'm an ice king.
Ha haha, no no, dear you misheard me. I'm not a nice king, I'm a-  A really nice king! And I'm single!
Ladies, I'll have time to meet you individually later, please just, just stop squirming.
Prison? Don't be ridiculous! It's a... waiting room! Stop squirming.
Finn and Jake! You'll never take me alive!
Oh yeah, I keep forgetting that.
Serve me?
Sounds... nice...
With my rod of niceness, I dub thee two my Nice Knights.
Please! I'm trying to tell my Nice Knights something!!
Come here.  The main enemy to the Nice King right now is the disorganization of his love life.
The ugly ones are all mixed up with the other ones! I need you to catalog them... or something.
After I choose my bride, then you can go punch the monsters.
Hey, Nice Knights, Turtle Princess is about to walk out that door, I told her that I like her a lot, but I really don't like her all that much, could you guys break it off for me?
Yes, yes, keep walking in a circle.
Princesses, I must speak with my knight in private. Go on back into your cage.
What's up, knight?
Your loyalty is in question?
Are you implying that I'm not the nice king!
Ugh, Finn, get rid of her.
She's too loud and lumpy, I like smooth princesses... smoo-o-o-oth.
Gaah! Finn, just punch her! Let me see what she looks like... smoo-o-o-oth.
Wait a minute Nice Knight, let's see what she can do.
Meh, no, I-I don't like her.
Hey! You're on thin ice Nice Knight!
The jig is up!
Ah, eh, heh heh, my jig is up. Up high! It's a highland jig.  And I have a new assignment for you, one with more knight related stuff, very important.
The Ice King stole my razor, sneak into his trap-filled ice castle and retrieve it.  And don't look through the shoebox he keeps behind the laundry bag in the closet.
Those are my orders!
And once I have my razor, I can select my elite army of wives and take over the world!
Ugh, what do the princesses see in this face? Hope I can keep this going. So many princesses to meet.  Whiskers!  I can't be growing whiskers now!!  Daaarrr, I haven't picked who I want to marry me!
Did you retrieve my stole razor?!
My beard! I-I-I mean what is that?!
Wait, I can't fly!
N-no, wait!
Ugh  Oh, eh?  Ladies, ladies, teh hee, I can shave it off again, a-and when you get fat, I'll grow it back! Eh!Hey hey hey!  So... I've been thinking about this a lot lately and, well, uh... phew, gosh, I'm so nervous... Finn, and Jake, will you give me your blessings so I can marry Princess Bubblegum?
What's wrong with me?!  No!  Not the latch!
Oh, my! How clumsy of me!
Hey, wait, you guys! I'm serious about Bubblegum! Look, I wrote her name all over my arms and legs!
Guys! It's not fair! She always hangs out with you, and it's not like you wanna marry her!
Whoa!  I told you already. I want your blessings so I can marry Princess Bubblegum!  Come on, guys, give me permission to marry her! I'll... I'll do a little dance for you!  Hmm? You like this?
Oh, come on! If you bless our wedding, then maybe she'll really love me.
I will! When you bless our wedding!
I tried to do this right, but you've driven me to thisdriven me to bad doing.
Eh... stupid thing... come on... eh...
I didn't want to do this, but by not blessing our wedding, Finn and Jake have forced me to kidnap you.
I know! But I'll show them... I'll show them how they've hurt us!
Ah!
Oh, no.  Oh, gross. This water stinks.
Look! Look what you've made me do to her!
Hey, where're you guys goin'? What's goin' on?
Man... I-I wanna go after them, but... that hole looks scary, doesn't it?  Well! Holes are holes!
Yep! Holes are holes! NYEH!!
We did? Hey, yeah, we did it!! Oh, you guys! This experience has brought us all so much closer together! Princess, I'm sorry for all of this. I love you, and I've decided to set you free.  Go free!!
Uh... Whoops, I've got the dropsies!No! Not my number one! Princess, if you die on me, I will never forgive you! I'll be lostlost in my own emotional labyri
Oh, my wife! Is there anything weird about her? I can't see through these pain tears!
It's just that... after Princess fell into the well, I saw something strange happen. Something I still don't understand.  OohAGH! Wait! Listen to me!!
Old man? Heh! What? I'm not old.
Old? I'm... I see. It's all making sense now. Brrrrapapo!  I'm going, Princess. I'm sorry if my skin grossed you out. Nobody wants to see this old skin, I guess.  Nobody in the world.
Peace.
Hey, Finn, are you dead or what?
Hey. I had to keep an eye on the princess because she's being possessed by the Lich.
But I do. I saw it with my wizard eyes!  In the well, I saw something come out of the Lich and go into the princess. But I wasn't sure it was real  because when you have stanky old wizard eyes, sometimes you see things that are real, and other times it's like crazy crazy crazy in your face all the time!   All the time...  Guys, let me help you. I don't want my future wife to be... physically unattractive.
Are you suuuuure?
Great! Weeee!
Wah!
Yeah! Whoopie!
Oh, yeah?
Okay. I didn't kill 'er this time. Everybody saw that, right?
Aw, dang it! Well, I'm outta here. Goodbye, everyone.Huh? Oh. Now where were we? To free yourself from this tomb, and nevermore re-enter, find the room amidst the rooms that lies exactly center?
Oh, dag.
Huh? This room doesn't have any doors.
Uh, nice, I guess?
Oh, uh -  Kinda lonely.
You're going to eat me? Yeah, right.
Come on, you guys. That mouse showed us the room door.
Say, you know what's weird?
Well, isn't it weird how Tree Trunks' ability to make pies is specifically what helped us escape from that room?
Right, yeah, like, battery pies or summin'?
Hey! Look, another room!
Good grief, it's humid in here.
Hold up, hold up!  Look!
There has to be a way to get across without that thing chompin' our WOO-HOOS!
Oh yeah, I can sure try.
Nggh! Aw dang, this heat is negating my powers! Can't do nothin' with this steam coming off the water.
NGH, glob! Fah!  Nagh! Look at this!  Well, that's it. Show's over. I'll just die here and y'all can eat my body if you want to survive.
H-help me guys!
NNGH! Lemongrab, c'mon!
Ew.
We almost there, Lemongrab?
Well that's okay, 'cause you can hack the mainframe or whatever, right BMO?
Ohhhs! I grabbed the wrong robot!  Dang! Nuts face!
Huh? Wha-wha-what's she sayin'?
Grrrr! All right! I knocked you all out and brought you here!
I'm sorry, but I had to do it. Each of you possess the exact qualities to pass the various tests of this dungeon: Tree Trunks with your baking skills;  Lemongrab with your lemony-juicy...
Yeah...  Shelby, who should've been the bait for the fish.
And..BMO, who should've been here instead of this weird piece of junk that I don't remember nothin' about.  Ahhh, I failed!
Yes! Yes! Oh, my son!  The grand prize of my loins!
Now you see why I needed to bring you all here. Behold! The Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving!
Whatever goes in the Magi's flames..comes to life, anything at all!
Yes! Isn't it amazing?!
Do not be sad. Because I brought the ultimate thing!  This.
Except..it's not my journal!  It's my Fionna & Cake fan-fiction!  All my brilliant fantasies will now be real.  Fionna, Cake, Marshall Lee; they'll all be living, breathing beings, just like me.
Yes! Yes!
No..NO! Another cruel joke on my life!
Oh, good..you're awake, you bum. Look what you did.. Get out of my Face! Yeah, yeah Get out!
OK.
They can?
Yes! Yes, if I can concentrate...
It worked!
Oh, Fionna, can dreams be real as waking life?
Then I will wait for you, from across the threshold of consciousness.
I, too, feel this; and it feels so strong it must be true.Yeah, you said it. I've been home this whole time.
What y'all whisperin' about?  Hehe! Ex-squeeze me.
Sure it is.
Mm, it's cozy.
See?
Oh, hey, Jake, can you bring me a sandwich?  Sandwich?
Don't forget the bread! Haha!
Oooh! Sandwich time!
Ahh, but that sounds lonely. I just like to stay here with you guys! Having roommates is nice! It keeps me out of my head. Gunther says only Wenk! What's up with that?
Oop.
Whoa-oh! I see what's going on!
Yeah! This wizard donk  is trying to jack my Tree House styles, just 'cause he beat me that one time at Wizard Battle! And if he takes one step closer, I'll bust him up one real good! I never asked to be...
Oh, you're right that ain't nothing! Check out this wizar!  Whoa!  What?
Well, maybe not ever ever! Am I the greatest wizard in our generation? Yes.
Finn!! Jake!! Come quick!! It's an emergency!! Hurry!!
Tada!
Well, then the second and third acts are gonna knock your socks off!
Of fright.
See, I told you! Isn't it awesome? Eh, since I'm pretty much in charge here, we can totally take all this treasure if we wanted to.
Oh, that's just a byncomire.
Wanna see something really cool?
Okay, but you gotta promise not to freak out!
This is Joshua the Dog's Demon Blood Sword.
Yeah! It's a real demon blood sword.
And you see these words?  If you say them out loud, you can actually see a vision of the demon whose blood was used to make the sword!
Ooh! I know how! Butyrum lac surepo kee oth pradium, like that!
Oops.
Come on, best friend,  let us not betray Finn! Let's fight Kee-Oth ourselves!
Oh! No! Oh, no! He's too powerful!
Uh, yeah, me, too. Hey, Abracadaniel, wanna hang out at my place?
Ice Kingdom's been rebuilt for weeks!I said, I don't know! I have nothing to do with this!
What? Really?
Oh, well...then...why would you say that?
Finn, I'm as concerned as you are. There's some sicko out there... What if he comes after my princess?
Yeah... let me introduce you to my new wife.  Oh, wait...you mean I'm the guy stealing all the p Yeah, okay, I get it now.
Hmmm... mmm aah! They're sleepy. They are our limp sleepy children! Come on wife, let's have a nice family meal.
Wife, you sit here. Isn't this nice?
Uh oh... I mean, that's good!  Oops! How fun! You're so fun!
Aww... marriage is fun!
See, when you wash and I dry, we get done faster! Then tomorrow night we switch!
Here, let me show you a trick, my darling. See, you let it soak and we'll wash it in the morning.
Enough chores... come along, dear. I want to show you something special...
Here it is. I hope you like it...
Oh... pretty baby wife. You're the most normal thing in my whole life. We're like two normal jelly beans sitting at the bottom of the jar, floating in a sea of olives, waiting for somebody to guess how many jelly beans are in the jar... which I mentioned.
Just look into my eyes and know that everything is okay.
Are you feeling normal yet?  Okay.  See that? We're normal, just like the normal people are.
Oh... don't mind the kids! It's just a phase!
Ooh, I'll go get
Hey, hey, hey....

To me, my penguins! Gunter, Gunther, Gunder, Goonder, come on! Gunter, Goonthy, Gonter, Ginthy, follow!

Girl, I love you as much as all of the other princesses in the world combined!
I'll prove it! See, you have Elbow Princess's hips, and Dr. Princess's heart and intestines, Slime Princess's bottom... You have all my favorite parts of my favorite princesses!
Oh, the parts don't matter. It's you that matters.
You're my wife! And I will always love my wife no matter what!
Sure, baby, even without all your fine lady parts. Now give us a hug.
Don't listen to them babe; they're being negative! Run, my happiness! I'll distract them with ice magic!

Arms out Gunter.

They think their party is the bee's knees huh. That party is the knees of nothing!
Bargh! There oughta be a law! Wait a minute... there is a law, hee hee, do I have what it takes?
I'm calling to tattle.
The party going on next door, it's bothering everyone in the Ice Kingdom.
Yes.
Yes, this is a little old lady calling about the loud party.
Noooo, this is Mrs. Garam-bling-ton...
Yeah, hold on let me get my husband.   Yeah, this is Mr. Garamblington, I need you to shut down this party.
Uh, hold on there's someone at the door.  Yes, hello?   Hey, Mr. Garamblington, it's me, the pizza delivery boy.  Oh, hi, Johnny.  Boy, that sure is a loud party out there, hope it's not bothering the Mrs.  It's okay Johnny, I'm on the phone with the Banana Guard and they're going to take care of it.
Oh, that's good.  Well, what do I owe ya, Johnny?  It's twelve fifty-seven, Mr. G.  Okay, there you go, the prices are going up.  Oh, geez, do you have anything smaller?  Ah, let me check with my brother, George. Hey, George!  What?!  The pizza is here, you got any cash on ya?  I only got a fifty dollar bill!
Yes?
Ha haa!  Now to watch Banana law in action.
Two can play the party game!  Ooh, nice. Alright come on Gunthalina, I need you to pass out some whirling dervishes, the guests are getting restless.
Loose grape medley, stack of enriched flour tortillas  and start with Roger, he looks famished.
Everyone, smile and eat... and make our neighbors jealous.
Bah! Gunter's too captivating!  Um? Oh yeah!  Oh this is my jam! Time to get my freak nasty on!  Roger, dance with me!   Come on! If only there was some way I could magically ruin their party.  Wait a minute  forgetful me!
I thought you were my bros, my roll dogs for life!
Well, if that's what it takes for a fella to get noticed around here, then whomp me!
Oh mama, that's some stink!  Aaaah!
Because she didn't invite me to her potluck!
The mail?! Who reads the mail! I just stack all my mail in a tall pile until it falls over, heh heh, then I shred it to use as cascarones!  So uh, can I party with you?
Nanners, well I don't even know the meaning of the word.
Whoo ooh! Party time, right guys?! Whooo hooo!What?!  Who dares enter the Ice Kingdom?!
You know why I'm here? Do you know what Ice King means?!
It means I'm King of Ice! This is my domain! And you are violating Ice World law--trespassing!
I don't care! This is my kingdom. You guys can't just scoot about on my land willy-nilly. I've got rules here.
What?! I am the king! I am the king of c-cool c-co ca... That's it! Rise, monsters of snow, and go beat up Finn and Jake!
Ooh, you guys are gonna get it.
I need a magic back.  Trail mix.  Ick...ooh, yogurt chip.  Tuck, tuck.  Aww man.
I'm back home! Hello, ladies!
Now, now. I've brought you a baby and a puppy.
What?
You don't understand! I collect princesses because I want to marry one.
I'm collecting them all first to be sure I make the right choice. You're both too young to understand, but marriage is a serious thing and lasts forever. You can't just rush into it, you know?
Of course they do! I would have killed them already if they didn't want to be here. Right ladies?  Zzhp Zzhp.
Nice try, boy! Princesses, did you see? Did you see Finn fail?
Oh, no you won't!
Eat it.
Oh, are you trying to hit me? Well, excuse me because I have to go potty in the bathroom.
What? Not having any fun? But last night I read you the story of Baby Whatsit and the Bottle Prince.
Other princesses, do you feel the same way?
Well, here, watch. I'll show you. We'll have some fun. Fun's my middle name.
Here, now, Wildberry Princess. I need you to play this.
Well, come here, I'll teach you. Put your hand through the bars, atta princess, and uh...
Just play it like I showed you.
PLAY IT OR I'LL SQUISH YOU INTO JUICE!!!
Yeah, keep playing it. Now everyone pick up an instrument and play it. Oh, this is going to be so much fun!
Oh, that was fun!
You're right! Good idea, Finn.
I hope they think I'm fun.
Make way for the fun tray! Whoa, what's happening?
What is this?
Because I left the room?
I don't get this.
Me? You want to dance with me?
Wow!  Yes! Yes! Whoopee!
Wait, no!  Don't leave! I'll kill you all!  Why are you doing this? Everyone was finally warming up to me.
Bah! Finn, you just ruined my chances with 5 or 6 potential wives! For that you will...  Ohh! Oh, my beard.
Why do people not like me? Is it because I'm a magic user or is my beard too shaggy?  I try so hard to be a good husband for girls. What's wrong with me?
Who are you?  I know. You're probably a--a big nerd! Why don't you try being cool like me?  Star dust is so ticklish!  What happened? Princesses? Ohhh...Ach! Where the turd is my Demonic Wishing Eye?! Grrrr...  I've looked everywhere! Ugh...
What is it, girl?
You know where it is? Lead the way! Oh boy, this is just wonderful!  Hmnh.  Agh! You just want me to brush you! You know this brush is for princesses only?  Ah, princesses only. No Gunthers!
What are my options here? Hmm. Hm-hm.  Gunther! What is your damage today?  Ooh! Wizard market!  W-I-Z-...
Hey!  You're really peeving me off, Gunther! Go stand in the corner!
I said stand in the corner.
Ugh. You make me sick.  Try not to break anything while I'm gone.
Wizards rule.
Doot-doo, deet-dee-doo. Ah, let's see.  That's the symbol for magic items, right?  Hey, this is the magic items shop, right?
I know that, I know! Why can't they write it on the sign, though? Why's it all gotta be secret? Let's just put it all out there, huh? Equal distribution of magic to the people!  No more symbols! No more initiations!  Ya feelin' me, Huntress Wizard?
Uh-uh, I was just steppin' to ya, girl, with my intellectual wizard politics.  No, don't go.  Well, Swing at every ball, that's what Jay T. Doggzone says.  Hello?
Keep what tight?
Yo. Guys. Chill. I lost my Demonic Wishing Eye.  Just get me a new one and I'll jet. I didn't hear nothin' about no weird, secret wizard club that I want to be a part of.
Oh, slid  You guys!  Ah!  Whoa!
Hey. What's goin' on here? Why's this place all crazy? I was just flying by and  Gunther! You took my stuff!
That's bad. You know what you get now?!
That's right, you get the squirty-squirts.  Bad, bad. Now take off my Demonic Wishing Eye.
Alright, Gunther. Now go home.
That's right, walk. And while you're walking home, you think about what you did.  It's getting worse and worse with him. He justhe hates it when I leave the castle. I'm sorry, guys.
Heh... well, I got into some crazy wiz biz over in Wizard City. Honestly, I don't even know how I survived. Basically, it was the craziest showdown ever. I I wish I could tell you all about it, but you knowWizards only, fools. Keep it tight.Huh?
Foolish interlopers! Zah!
Ee hee hee heeOOH!  MY EYESIGHT!
I will kiss her! I will!  Hold still.  Mwah!
What?!  EEEEGH!!   The hour is yours, but the day shall be mine! Just like you, PrincessMINE!
No, Finn!  You were not wrong. He is evil!
But my enervated condition has everything to do with him.  I was trying to cast a spell that would give me total control of Princess Bubblegum's heart! ...But I messed it all up... and lost control of mine.  He planned to rip out Princess Bubblegum's heart... to make it his bride.  Without my heart, I grew weak.  But I made my way to the Candy Kingdom to look for him. In an alleyway, I begged him to  return to me and leave the princess alone.  But he threw me in the dumpster and left me for dead.  Stop Ricardio!
Stop! Stop it! That's my heart, you piece of
Oh, yeah...
Come to daddy...
Yeah, there you go...  Like that? Huh?
I feel wonderful! Hahaha! And now that I've saved the Princess, she'll marry me and live in my dungeon every day!
Yes you WILL!  Well... maybe not today... or tomorrow... but another day! AnotherMarceline! Marceline! I'm open, I'm wide open! Marceline, I've got ups! Check out my ups!
Ha-ha! Yeah, alright! Good game, good game! Take 5!  I'll get us all a bunch of little waters.
Yeah! Lay down, Marceline, go to sleep! Right? What are we talking about?
Whoa, so what happens next? How does it end?
Aww, that's nice.  Marceline, you keep telling these chump stories while I score a bunch of baskets.
Yeah, yeah!Yo! Leave me out of it!I shouldn't be laughing, I'm sorry. Oh, I know, I'll do the opposite.  Oh, boohoo.  Ah, this is weird.
Whoa, whoa. I didn't do anything to you, okay? C'mon, guys, I'm your friend.
Ooh, because I froze you... with this.
I sprayed it on you while you slept.
No! Gunter, no! This one likes to break bottles, don't ya?  Tuck-ety tuck! Let's move to the living room.
Why? Oh, because I love you guys. But you don't love me, do ya?
I only try to kill you 'cause you're princess-blocking me all the time! Anyway, now that you're frozen, we can bond and stuff. And the sooner we do, the sooner I can spray you with this.
Ah, I underlined the un so I wouldn't mix 'em up.
We are?
What's my favorite color?
You don't love me. I know a lot about you guys. Jake, you don't put ice in your drink because you have sensitive teeth.
And Finn, your favorite food is meatloaf.
And Jake, sometimes you don't cry because you're afraid of real emotion. It's okay. Let it out.  You don't love me  Bad penguin!
Huh, in this economy?  Ah, I'm gonna go make some lemonade.
I've got lemonade! You want some, Jake?
Huh? Gunter...  No, Gunter! No bottles. Look at me.
What am I gonna do with you?  You're going to have to wear a leash.  This should keep you out of trouble.  Now, our first bonding activity will be walking in each other's shoesso to speak. To better understand each other's perspectives, we're going to dress up like each other. Me first!
It's adventure time! I'll save you, Princess! Let's have babies, Princess, and let's teach them to be good babies! Oh, Princess, sure, I'll kiss you. I'm a hero. Hey Finn, don't you think it's weird there's two Finns? Finn?  Not talking? Now, I'm gonna dress like Jake.
Okay, okay! We'll bond in another way.
So, I wanted to show you something telling of my soul. I take artful black and white photographs of my penguins' body parts. Photography is art; let's see some art.  Okay, first one. See how Gunter is staring into the camera? He's saying, Here I am. Look at me. Accept me. Okay, second one.  This is a haunting image of a penguin's flipper. Look at how it penetrates the negative space. Oh yes, this one is very
...Yeah, I've thought about it a lot, and having a little gallery show might be nice. A little cheese, a little cider... could be nice, y'know?  Maybe bring a veggie plate? I think people would appreciate that.
This next one is very rewarding...
Gunter!
You are being naughty, Gunter. You've interrupted my thing.  Now you stay right here and go to sleep.  Sleep.  Aw. So cute. Alright, back to art.
Okay, time for a break. Who wants lemonade?  Ooh, don't want to lose this.  Gunter! Jake! No! You're bonding without me.
It's for your own good, sweetie.  Now then.
Well...  not before our next bonding activity: late-night gab session! Do you want to talk about girls? Do you have a crush on anyone?
Ohhhhhh! Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.  Know who I have a crush on?  Princess Bubblegum.
Oh, I do. I've liked her for quite some time. Feels weird to say it out loud.
Who's hungie? Jake, you hungie?
Alright, fair enough. Well, how 'bout I make us some omelettes?
I'm gonna put my foot in it. Eating a part of me will bring us closer together.  I'll be inside of you!
Well, I don't want to use too much foot. It'll overpower the eggs. Take away from the omelette.  Huh? Aah!
Finn! and Jake! and a bunch of butterflies! and a sword!
What do you want from me?
No! We're not friends yet. You haven't eaten my omelette.
Oh, alright. I don't know how you're doing this, but it is impressive.
Wait a minute... which bottle is thi?  I think they brought me the wrong bottle. Gunter's still upstairs.  Gunter! Gunter! Gunter! Gunter!!You don't understand! If you were me, you would do things I would do!
I ... yeah, I would... but I wouldn't get past my invincible armor!
Not a scratch, boys! Not a scratch! It's my time to shine!
Fools! Fools! You're wasting your ti-yime!
Fools, fools, fools...
In-ice-able vince armor...
Help! Help! Somebody help me! Ah! Oh, sweet mama!
Aah! You can have the sandwiches back! I'm sorry! Help!
Boy, those sandwiches look really cool!  It looks like it'd be really awesome to try a bite of one of those  ... right on, right on.
You know ... maybe we could all learn a thing or two from those sandwiches.
... Thank you.Check out this sweet make out wagon!  Life giving magus bro!
Yo, yo.  Ron James bro!
Not much, not much.  Finn's old hat bro!
Sure, sure.  Hey, uh..
Beau bro, right!  Leaf Man bro!  And, uh... Who's this guy?
How 'bout we call you...Giuseppe.  That's right, Giuseppe.
Finn and Jake's crib? They won't come. They're out of our league.
Uh, why'd we stop?
I'll dance if dancing is needed.  Doo-doo doo doo-doo. Yah yah, doo-doo wah  Dance, dance, dancin' dance writing.  I'm dance, dance, dance, dancin'. Top of the bus, window...
We can't! Our wheels fell off!  Back on the vehicle. I'll make a slick ice road.
Oh!
I ran out of juice.
Yeah, maybe you should. Hey, let's switch headgear.  Ooh, it fits!  Yeah, girl, just let the ice magic flow.  Oh, b-but be careful, okay?
Oh!  Not me.  Nice ice road.
Uh, hold on.  Everyone, time to push the bus!
Come on! Destiny!  Okay, back on the bus! Back on the bus!  Huh? Ooh, a crabapple tree. Giuseppe, make yourself useful and grab us some of them crabapples.  Okay, get ready. Jump!
What?! Magus of Life Giving, take the wheel!
Giuseppe, throw the crabapples!  Giuseppe?  We have lost Giuseppe.  Mm! Hmm? Well, let's see what old Giuseppe wrote.  Listen to this, everybody! These are not my tear drops, daughter dear, but just a sheen of dew that lingers here, past other fields where other fathers lie, who kept their daughters better far than I.  What do you guys think?  What's wrong with you guys?
Huh?  This is true art.  Well, let's see what you other guys wrote.  Little Dude, here's yours. Days don't have shades, directions with no ways, adjusting minimum scholarly curriculum to enrich empty minds, it takes refracted sunshines. That is awesome. Take this light with your great might, free hearts that are gated seeing truth in things exaggerated. Ah, some interesting spell combos going on guys.
The hour of glory is upon us. Cauldron!
No, don't go.  Hey, I could freeze all of us. Then we'd be safe from drowning, and once someone discovers our preserved bodies, we'll be saved! Be like, 200 years, tops!
Yoink. Take my head away from here, baby!  No!
Giuseppe, how have you done this?
I don't know, Abracadaniel, but I think he was trying to show us something. Something new.
Giuseppe.Gunter, let's go! I've got the overnight bag.
Oh, greata line.  Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me.
You know I was.   Counter maid, I demand medical attentions,  preferably those of a princessy type.
Hey! I'm as healthy as ten old men!
Ah! Oh, oh, right!  My penguinhe's very, very sick. So... what time does your shift end?
What's taking that doctor so long? Gunter, make more noise!
Yeah, alright. Don't oversell it, drama queen.
Yes, well, uh...  Come to Ice King, Princess.
Just give it to me straight, doc. Am I gonna have to pay for this?
What can you do for him, Doctor Princess?  Without Gunter, I'll be all alone. You see, I'm a widower.
Oh, what? Is that what that means?
Gunter, you're embarrassing me!
Okay, m'dear, this enclosure will be your new home!
...but once you get used to the smell of penguin manure, it's almost tolerable.
Princess? What?
What princess?
Wrong-o. I was at the hospital, for it turns out Gunter here was preggers!
I was just talking to the egg! It's such a cutie!
What? No!  Fuh. Anyway, get out of my house or I'll kill you, et cetera. I want to take a nap in my easy chair.  What happened to my recliner?!
My skins and tubs!
You even violated my secret sanctum?! What is wrong with you?!
No! No princess!
Yeah, what the heck?! You think you can just wreck my house and wear my collectibles?!  Hah! Who do you guys think you are?!
You're not ninjas! You're just a couple of jerks!
Yeah, do it; make it right. And start by, uh... oh, take my bag over to the cage.
Oh, no, no, no! Not that! Never mind! Put that down and go clean my gym equipment.
Oh, heh... I have no idea how that got in there!
Yes, Gunter's ailment was the perfect cover for stealing a princess, M.D.
Enough! You may have uncovered my princess-smuggling scheme, but you'll never leave this place alive!
Doot, doo, doooo!  Ninja!
Gunter! Why didn't you tell me?
Oh, Gunter...Roger that, Princess.I just wanna be happy!
I should go.
That's none of your business!
Gentlemen, I'll see you later.
NO!
Is that all the ice ya have?
Well, you should really have more.
What if you had guests?
Ok, ok, I'll tell you! I was watching you... to learn how to be happy.
It's true! I would like to be happy like you guys. But, I have no idea how.
Have pity on me.  I've been so sad and miserable, I cry all the time. But, whenever I see you two, you always look so happy.
But, they're just hopping over each other.
So yes, I've decided to spy on you, dressed as a horse.
But, I guess my plan failed. All I observed was you two arguing over...how to get rid of me.
Hey, are you sleeping?  Is this it? Sleeping? Could it be that all I need is a good night's rest?
Ahh... I'm... still not happy.Oh, boy  Oh, you're so pretty when you sleep, let's go back to Ice King's house,  Hi, baby....
Baby, I was trying to surprise you by moving you to my place while you sleep, then have you wake up to breakfast in bed, but now you've ruined the surprise, way to go.
Okay, here we go, you're the victim right? You know what, since day one I've been doing everything to make this relationship work and for what?!
Babe, come on, we promised we wouldn't make our problems public
No, baby! What are you doing?!  Baby bear!  This is just so crazy, if you can honestly look into your heart and tell me you want me to leave, I'll go!
Uh-what? D-did you look in your heart, like all around it?
I see. Then obviously you have got some heavy emotions stirring in you and you have said some very rash things.  Guards! Take me away!
I'm leaving!
Uh, I don't know, did I say the right thing? I can never tell with that girl.   All I can think about... is you, baby girl. I gotta leave Ooo, start somewhere fresh.  Goodbye, Gunter, you're the... man of the house now.
Oh, clam balls!
Where am I?  Hmm, no signs of life. Just me and these palm fronds,  And that bird over there.  Well, won't be needing this anymore,   I miss her, man.  Hello?  Is someone here?  Must be from somewhere.  There, now I can look around and- sweet mother of Glob! This island doesn't have a lady - this island is a lady!
Hello.
No.
No!
No!!
Ugh, hold on a sec!
Fuu, what was the question?
No, um, not at all, in fact it was quite enchanting.
Boyfriend?
Oh eh, sure, I mean, I know of him.
Crazy jealous?!
Ugh, what a wad bag.
Gurl, he's no good for you.
Ah, who am I kidding. My GF, Princess Bubblegum, treats me like poopies too. The expression on your face when he bounced out on ya, well, I might as well have been lookin' in mirror.
Yeah, that's us.
Are you sure?
Yeah, well, PB is just so closed off to her emotions, she crushes the relationship so she doesn't ever have to develop feelings.
Oh, that's terrible, at least Bubblegum cares if I'm there.
Yeah, he's awful, you shouldn't have to put up with that.
Yeah, girl.
Yeah, girl!
Oh, snaps! Good luck!
Uh! What was that?!
You should have been like: I am done with you! Bam! Pack your bags and get out my face!
Whatever, I'm gonna break up with him for ya'!
Hey, yo! Yo, dog! I need to talk to you.
I'm Ice King, we sort of met that time at Peppermint Butler's. Anyway, I've been spending lots of time with your girlfriend, and she re-.
Yeah, but no! It was strictly platonic! I wasn't hitting on her or anything.
Whoa mama!  L-let's talk this out! Think about what's best for her- Ice Lightening!!
Wowzers!
Take it easy, wolfy, I just stomped grapes on her tummy, alright! Ahh! Bread balls bread balls bread balls!  Psych!  Eat it, party puppy!
She is not your bid-ness!
Uh oh.  Hmmm.
I've come to a decision, you ready to hear it? I'm breaking up with ya! You party too much, you never want to spend time with me and you only care about having fun and other people's stereos! I'm just a big island you can come and go from as you please!
Banana Guard yourself, Princess!!  Ah, we'll work it out.Huh? Wha-? Where am I? Gunter?
Gunter?
I don't think this is Gunter.
Lumpy Space Princess?
And you're doing this because you like me?
Okay.
I know!
The Prince Who Wanted Everything; A Fionna and Cake Adventure? Hey, why isn't my name on there?
Okay, might as well...at least until the cops show up. Ahem!
Once upon a time, there was a most handsome prince, the future king of Lumpy Space, Lumpy Space Prince.
Okay, Okay! Yeesh!
But, all was not perfect for this philanthropic prince of the people.
His parents were slobbering monsters who didn't care that he was a beautiful prince! They wanted him to be a monster too.
I...Uh...I don't-
And then, Lumpy Space Prince became so real that he can actually break through into this plane of existence. Woah!  And meet his one true love, Lumpy Space Princess. It was really happening. The secret portal began to shake and tremble.
The countdown began. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5...Oh... why won't you die?
Yes, Finn?
You want some of this too? Huh? Eh.
Let's work together!  To defeat the wand!
Yeah, yeah!
Whoop! Whoop! Whoop! Whoo!
Did I get it?Nope. Not a car guytoo confusing. Got better things to do with my life.Who is it?  Zap zap zap zap zap zap zap!  Ooh, someone left me a gift. Peanut brittle? But I'm on a diet.
Oahh! Finn, you have destroyed my faith in canned peanut brittle! Zap!  Oh, no, my crown has all my powers in it!
Oh, this is a total rook!
I didn't steal it! I made that item! ...Made it with the magic that I stole! So hand it over, or I'll strike menacing poses at you!
These bars can't hold me forever! Hey there's only like two of 'em. You fools have no business guarding prisoners.
Hmm?
How about you just hand me my crown. I'll create some ice bars.
I'm toying with you, ha ha, psychologically.
So what am I being charged with?
Gah! Of course it matters! The way things work is first, I transgress your meaningless rules and then you maliciously persecute me!
Fool! You have disrupted that order, for--are you ready for this?--I have committed no recent crime!
I'm rockin' your worldview!
Oh, yeah? You know who really deserves to be in jail? I will show you the true jerks!  Behold!
Behold!  Wha, Behold!  Behold the true jerks!
Is it time for my hour in the yard, boss?
This is a trick, huh?
There must be someone waiting outside to beat me. Ooh, is that my crown over there?
Hey!
Get out of my room!
So, you're really breaking me out?
You mean, you believe me? Oh, can it be? Has all the hatred between us transmuted into something more? A friendship? A best friendship.  Knucks?  Oh, ho ho, slaps in disgust, eh? Let's call them Slappy D's! Okay, see you later, my bosoms!
Cast Detect Secret Door!  Success!  Wa ha ha ha!
Finally! Freedom and friends FOREVER!!!
Hey, hey, Princess, check out my new trick!  It's snowing it's snowing for you!
So let me get this straight... You're hitting on me.
I think I heard the word Virile in there. Oh, she is definitely hitting on me.
Be gone, you biddies!
Oh, my gosh, she came to me this time.
I'm coming forth! Hee hee, is that the voice of friendship I hear?  So, are you fellas ready for game night?
What? Why?
I... yes?
Yeah... right! Everyone knows that!
Oooh, of course, friend. Awoo-hehehehe! Oh, I've got the sillies! I couldn't possibly without giggling uncontrollably. I'm just so giddy about you being here!  I'm a banana!  Don't slip on me!
Wait a sec, there's a bug on you, friend. Smack!
You know, I carved these game pieces from my own teeth.
Huh? Crying?!
I was only saving you from poo poo palms!
No! No, my...my bosom! What hath I done?! My friend!  My only friend.
Why?! Why?! WHY?!!!
WHY?!!!... Ah, well. Gunter! Dispose of Finn's carcass.Is that you, honey?  How was your day at work?  Terrible! How could I possibly stand to be apart from you, the Ice King?!  You see, Gunter, that's how it would go if I actually had a wife.
Game time!  Kill the frog! Kill the frog! C'mon! Oh, he's right in front of you! Lower! L Stupid lady. Kill it...
No, no! That frog is casting magic missiles on my babe!
No, c'mon, get out of theUGH! Move!
Baaaugh!  This game cheats anyway!  LOOK WHAT YOU DID, GUNTER!!
What are you on about? You're starting to infuriate me... It's almost like you're trying to alert mewarn me about... I don't know, an intruder or something? Perhaps he's lurking in this very room, just outside my field of vision!
Well, knock it off!!
Hmm. You're looking kinda fat, Gunter! Look at these arms! Fat fat fat! Daddy's little fattie! Oh, you'll never get a prom date with all that chub on your face, you know!  Ooh! Oh, blast these melty ceilings!
What was that?
Huh? An intruder! Maybe a beautiful princess like in my poems.
Whoa, ice-o-pede! Finn?! Oh, why can't you ever be a princess?! Ice-o-pede, attack!  Ice-o-pede, no! Aaah!
Hahaha! Finish him off, my semi-loyal pet!  An innocent bystander?! ZAP!
Crush him! Crush him like you crushed me!!
Come on!
Something about that robot I tried to kill fills me with... deep longing.
THREE!
I've come to take my son.
Come to Papi, son. I won't attack you... unless provoked.
It was my power that activated his full potential. Zzz.
When you were struck by my lightening, you also became infused with my private particles. He wants to be with me, Finn!
Don't worry, son. I'll show you the life you deserve!
Yes! Now that we've entered my imagination zone, allow me to tantalize you with this!  Princesses! As my son, you will carry on the tradition of capturing ladies!
I want a son who can do better than I. One who can succeed where I... have failed. You can mate with robot princesses!
NO!! I'll show you what will happen if you hang out with Finn!
NOOOOO!!  I'm through playing around, son. Who do you choose?
He made his choice! Get over it, crybaby!
WHHHAAAAT  Aah! My face!  I birthed you and I can un-birth you!
OOF!
No, let's just stay here a little longer, son.Eee!
Think this is the right address,  mmm is this, is this....
You can not defeat me, child!
Now I can kill you! Oh wait, wait, wait. I am so stupid! Silly Billy! I came by to tell you the good news!
I'm getting married... to someone who wants to marry me!
My betrothed is right over there!  Hi, honey!
I'm a lucky guyI didn't even have to kidnap this one! She fell in love with me the moment I slipped on her engagement ring!
The lady penguins are throwing her one of those bachelorette parties.
Oh well, no more capturing pretty princesses for this Ice King!
Hmm?
Sure wish someone would throw me a bachelorette partyoop, I mean, man-lorette party.
If you won't throw me man-lorette party, then I'll never have my last hurrah before buckling down with that battle axe! It'll drive me back to a life of stealing hot princesses! Is that what you want?!
Best man-lorette party ever!
Fah!  Hahahaha! Now I'm gonna go get married! Hehehehe! I'm gonna get married!
Yeah--wait. No more s-stealing princesses? Wow.
I didn't realize I'd have to give up stealing the ladies.
I know what I said, but, y'know, sometimes you say things and then you don't really mean them.
I'm just not sure I wanna get married in such a hurry. What if she's just after my  Demonic Wishing Eye and Ghost pouch?
Maybe I'll just go back to capturing lots of girls. It's what I feel comfortable doing, y'know? Being free, wind at my back, lots of girls, kidnapping 'em.
Really? Why?
My mind is made up80% sure. No marriage.
Bleh, those stinky old swans. Huh?
Ohhhh, now I get what you guys are trying to tell me! Marriage is a thing that allows me to capture a princess forever and let her live inside of me!  Marriage is the most beautiful thing in the world!
The wedding? Back on100%!
Finn, Jake, you made it!  Come on up here. I'm almost finished tying up my bride.
This is a traditional wedding ritual for good luck in the Ice Kingdom. You see, she'll be hoisted up and then lowered downand when she touches my beard from above, she will be my queen!
Thank you! Excuse me as we finish preparing for the nuptials. 2, 4, 8, 16, 20, uh
Yes32, 64, one hundred andeh.
She fell in love with me the moment I slipped on her engagement ring.
No! She's my love boat!
Okay, that's your opinion!
Yeah, yes, that's right.
Oh, I don't know... I'm complicatedand spontaneous!  That's probably why she wants to marry me!
Silence!
It's time for the lowering ceremony! Hoist her up!
Hehehehe! Commence the lowering!
Yes, nothing can stop me now.
Strangling the groom's nose at a wedding?  What's wrong with you?! You're the one that there's something wrong with!
I think you dropped something.  Catch!
Now, let's try that again.  Lower her!
Here she comes. Yes, touch my beard, deary. Yes, that's right. Almost there...
Oh! I'm married, right, snowman?
What? What's that supposed to  Oh no.
Come on, guys. Help me celebrate my un-marriage.Mm-hmm. You guys come here to watch me win?
Ha! I'm not gonna lose! I've got a foolproof plan for winning.  I'm gonna cheat.
Ooh, I just can't wait to taste that sweet Bubblegum.
Oh, yeah.
Yeaah!
Nun-chucks vanish!  Boo yah!
Wiz biz! Wiz biz! Oh, I can almost taste those sweet lips.
Hey, guys. Guys? What are you whispering? Come on! I gotta a surprise for yous fools.
Yeah. That's right. Just a little closer.  Ooh, what's in here? In my little sleevey hole?
Whoo!
My nun-chucks! Nooo!!
I have powers too, you butts! Yahh! Ice sword!  Ice Shield!
Wha? What you say?  B'oh!
How 'bout me? Put me on the grid, scale of one to ten. One is totally gross, ten is like, Hey, Ice King. You look crazy sick.No way! I'm no rat! I am bound by the sacred trust of esoteric knowledge!
You think I'll just hand you the keys to the city? I'd rather die.
Ow! My pinky!  Ow.  Thank you.  You know, no one has touched me in months. Could you touch me again?
Ow! Ohh! Ohh! Wizards Rule! THE PASSWORD IS WIZARDS RULE! AAH--
Ooh!
Whoa!
