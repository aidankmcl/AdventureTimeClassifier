Puhoy there! I am Quilton, son of Pillowford, and you have saved our village! You and your sharp pillow.
Oh, nonsense! This calls for a celepillowbration!
Oh, ha ha, oh my! Puhzah!
Woo oo ooh hoo hoo! Pill-ightful!
Of course, we will do our best to help you, Finn the Flesh Pillow. But you're not making a fold of sense!
Please, share our food. You need nourishment.
I'll give your compliments to the pillow.
Honk, honk!
Puhoy!
Oh oh oh, come here! Oh, but I've come to speak with your father.
When you first arrived here, you told us of a mysterious door that led you to our world.
Archaeologists found this in the Pillow Catacombs:  The Pillownomicon.
There is no information about the door, save for the fact it shows up periodically, and then disappears.
