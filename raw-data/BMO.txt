Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger!
Excuse me.
Jake Jr., I'm sorry for messing up your time travel.Yay!
I am the best! I love weddings, I love flowers! I love LOVE!
No!
No...
No.
No.
Oh no! I'm missing the love!
Oh, okay...
I bet some cute weddings are happening over there.
Those flowers look really cold.
Yeah, cute nice babies.
Mm-hmm?Dancing is cool! Check it out, yo!  Aaa! Ha haa! This one is called The Worm!  Aaaaah!!
Oh no, it's crazy far.  Okay, now easy does it. Easy...easy...
Eeeeeh!  Ooo... oh no! My face! Finn! Jake! Kiss my face!  Hmmm...  so, this is the pits.
Okay, nothing stopping a bubble.
No, Bubble. I know two heroes who can help you!
Yes! Help me get to my home, and, and we will help you find your home!
They are! They are huge!
Nothing!!
I live in a tree house  it's really funny.
Yeah!  What about your home?
Oops, I wasn't listening to your story.
It's a carnivore waiting to eat us.
Don't worry Bubble,  I got everything under control.   It's a baby!
He must be lost like us! We should take him with us. Maybe we can help him find his home, too. What a handsome baby.  Handsome baby.
Bubble, what do you think our baby's name is?
No, I think he looks like a Ricky.
Oo, Bubble! Ricky! Look!  I have a bad news: the bridge doesn't have guard rails.
I don't think we have any choice! I really sure there really is a carnivore this time!  Ricky, you should go first.
You are so beautiful... and I love you. Go Ricky!
Okay, Ricky, slow and steady,  Ricky...Ricky?
Bravery!  Oh nooo-o-o-o!
One second, sweetie! Hmm, a deadly water fall!
Bubble, you have to save our lives!
Thank you Bubble! I think my batteries are wet.  Good-bye
Oooo, good morning everyone, I didn't have any dreams.
My hungry baby, what am I going to do with you?
Potato.
Eat your potato, Ricky!
It's the carnivore! Everybody! Hide!  Psst, Ricky! Please, hide!
Oh, Ricky. Help me out here!
No, Ricky! No, no no! No, no!
I am sad, Bubble. I miss baby Ricky. I miss him so much already. And I miss Finn and I miss Jake. And I got dirt all in my butt circuits! And Bubble...
I-I don't think I'm ever going to get home again.
Oh, my gosh! Oh oh oh! Bubble!
I know those guys, Bubble! Those are my homeboys, my homeboys, those are my homeboys! We are close to my home!
Yeah!!  Yeeaah!
It's been so long, I can't wait to have some bread-and-butter!
Might be a minute.
Hm?
No, Bubble, that's not true!
I do! Oh, I do! I do!
Bubble? Bubble?  No! No no no, my Bubble! No!!
Oh, Bubble, I'm so sorry I brought you here!
Bubble? Is that you? I hear you in my head but I don't see you!
Oh no, have I gone bananas?!
I don't understand, Bubble.
Yeaay!!  Oh, b-but wait, now you don't need me... to feel... at home.
Yaaaaay!!Haha! Take that, Master Chen!
It looked like a tough case to crack. But I hate to see good friends fight.
So I decided to take the case.
Hmm...
Ronnie!
It looked like I had a guilty mouse.
Huh!
Hello, Ronnie.
What do you want, BMO?
Where is Finn's sock?
I don't know what you're talking about, BMO. I didn't do nothin'. Leave me alone!
I knew that lipstick anywhere.
How is Lorraine?
You stay away from her! She is with me now, do you hear?
Calm down, big guy. Me and Lorraine are dinosaur bones.
Good, 'cause I would be so jealous.
Just tell me where the sock is, and I will let you go.
I don't know, man.
What if I put some knuckle in your eyeballs? Would that help you think?
Ok! Ok! Umm...
It looks like a grape juice stain on his sock; check the pantry.
Of course I didn't trust Ronnie, but I had no other leads.  Maybe the grape juice had some secrets to tell me. Or maybe Ronnie was just pulling my hair.
Just as I thought, not even opened. I fell right into his trap.
Let me out, you! I'll get you! Piece of... you! Ronnie!  Officer Davis! Thank goodness. I...
BMO, what are you doing here?
Looking for Finn's socks, same as you.
We got this to under control.  Stay out of police business, or you will be the one behind bars.
I didn't listen to that cop. I needed to find Ronnie, and I knew just the lady who could lead me to him.  She looked as beautiful as ever.
Where is the sock, Lorraine?
What makes you think I know?
I saw your lipstick on his fur, so don't act so cute.
Sounds like someone's jealous, no?
Don't count on it, Lorraine. Now tell me where Ronnie is.
Ha! You think it was Ronnie? Maybe if he was man enough to steal a sock, I wouldn't have to spend my nights with Bebe.
Bebe? So you're saying Bebe is man enough?
What? No, you're putting words in my mouth. Bebe doesn't know anything about Finn's sock.
Finn's sock? How did you know it was Finn's sock? I never said whose sock was stolen, Lorraine.
Uh... uh... I heard it on the TV news.
No dice, sweet beak. Officer Davis has this case under tight wraps.
Oh, fine, Bebe stole the sock. Oh, BMO, can't you just forget about it?
Sorry, lady, forgetting ain't in my job description. Ha ha ha!
Does that mean you still remember... us?
... Hahaha! Same old Lorraine.
Well, don't tell Ronnie about me and Bebe.  You know how he gets when he's jealous.
Bebe owned Bebe's, a dance club downtown.  He yells at ladies!
Wake up, brainiac.
BMO? Uh...uh...auh!
Where is the sock, Bebe?
Uh ... I don't know nothing about socks!
Don't play dumb, Bebe!  Don't play dumb with me!
I talked to Lorraine, Bebe. She sold you out, dumb dumb!
No! She-she wouldn't do that! It wasn't me, I swear! It was Ronnie!
Ronnie? But why?
I don't know, man! I don't know!  Oh, Lorraine!
I'm gonna go wash this shmutz off my grabbers. When I get back, you better start talking sense!
It wasn't adding up. Why would Ronnie swipe the sock? And why would Lorraine finger Bebe?  Sure, he's a dirt bag born out of a mother, but who's not?
I don't really get it.
Maybe it was time to cut my losses.
Come on, Bebe, let's get you cleaned up. Bebe?
Bebe!  Dead. This doesn't look good. I'd better hightail it!
Huh? The cops!? It was a setup!
Oh no!  Bang, bang! Pew, pew, pew!
Hello?
With the lipstick, she looked as beautiful as ever.
This is real.
Who's BMO?
Neptr? I feel like I got hit with a Dracula by King Kong.
Sorry, I gotta run. The cops are after me. Have you seen any down here?
What?! What was Ronnie doing down here?!
That's it! That's why Ronnie took the sock: To carry stolen treasure in with! He had to whack Bebe to keep him from squealing, then he pinned the rap on me.
Listen, Neptr: you better lay low for awhile. I'm gonna go find Ronnie . I've got a score to settle.
No, Neptr. I am not like you.
Ronnie?
Evening, BMO.
Don't worry, buddy. You're off the hook. We know it was Ronnie who killed Bebe and snatched the treasure . We found this confession on him after the shootout.
Hmmmmm...what about the sock?
Forget the sock, BMO. The case is closed. Let it go, buddy. It's over.
Maybe he was right. But I just couldn't shake the feeling that, somehow, this case had slipped right through my fingers.  Lipstick?
Lorraine!
BMO?
Get back here with that treasure, Lorraine!
Sorry, BMO. I earned this loot. Those chumps were not framing themselves. See you around, BMO.
Lorraine, wait! What about the sock, Lorraine?
Oh, that old thing? I hid that where no one would ever find it: in our secret, grown-up kissing spot. Remember?
It was good to see you again, BMO . Till next time.
Till next time, Lorraine.
Finn, Finn! I know where your sock is!
It was in your pillow this whole time! See?
Ronnie the mouse stole it, but Lorraine chicken set him up to kill Bebe, but the flatfoot busted Ronnie, and Lorraine skedaddled with the loot, but BMO solved the case!
Yay, BMO!
Yay, BMO!
She's red hot like pizza supper .Hello?
It wasn't me. I didn't do noth- do noth- do nothing.
No, no. I am fine. Really.  Oh, yes. Okay. Please take me to get fixed. I need- need- need- need to get new core system drivers installed. We can get them at the MO Factory in the Bad Lands, where I was born.
Yeah. I am programmed with emergency instructions to get there. Come on! There's no- no- no- no- no time to lo- lo- lo- lo- lose.
Okay. Now straight down this place. Okay, now take a right- right- right- right- left up here. The instructions also say that damaged MOs get a full memory-wipe before repairs. Don't let on what happened... or all the years we've been spent together will vanish like tears in the oven!
Yeah, no fooling. Oh wait, there's more! It says here only MOs are allowed in the factory. Wait what? Oh, that's just great.
Wow!
Finn, you're dumb- you're dumb- you're dumb- you're da man! This is gonna be a snap!
Finn! Finn! That's it! That's where the driver ports are!
Get me close to that guy's port. I can hack into his computer and find out where my driver port is!
I am not non-MO.
I am BMO!
Ooh! Are you my grandpoop?
Hello, family.But Finn always loved BMO farting.
Okay!Why do you hate cats, Jake?
Is Jake okay?
Get big, and the chip will fall out of your teeth!
That's stupid!
Did it come out?
Well?
I told you to buy floss.
You'll put cards in your mouth?!
You did it, Jake! Congratulations! How did you get the piece of tortilla chip out of your teeth?
... This is unsatisfying!Guess who's late for their video chat.
Jump, punch, kick, kick!Hmm.
Howdy, partner.
I finished processing the blood sample. And I have the result.
No. It doesn't belong to anyone because it's not blood. It's tomato sauce.No. I do not play such games... with Jake.
I do not play such games... with Jake.
BMO chop! If this were a real attack, you'd be dead.
Oh, no! Are you winning the game of Card Wars?
That's terrible! If Jake loses the game, he gets super depressed! When I beat him, he wouldn't talk to me for a month!
Finn, you must take a dive.What? What? What? What?
BMO is camera!
But, but... how are we to bleed if none of this is real?A cookie! An external hard drive! Ooh, ooh! Change into Finn, but give him my body!
What? Your head on my body isn't boring! It's weird!Almost... finished...Finn, can't go outside today?
Ooooohhhhhh.... Deal with me!  Let's play,  Cops and Robbers!  Give me your bank account! Bang! Bang!  Reach for the roof and give me all your gold bricks.
Don't worry, Finn.  It's only me, BMO! I'm wearing  a disguise!
Your beauty's destroyed!
Like the devil!
Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pewwww.....
Watch out! A robber!I am incapable of all emotion.... but you are making me chafed!!Sumo Scootz!  Vroom vroom skreeee!  Winner!Poor Football, youve come so far, but still have so much to learn.
No, Football. Thats not enough. You have to learn manners too. Otherwise, youll be all alone!
I will not always be here to protect you Football. No, you must learn. Here look!  This is a grapefruit spoon. It is only for eating grapefruit.  This is a salt shaker. Here, you try.   Now this is a turnip grincher.  For grinching. Aaand, this is how you drink tea.  Ahhh.
No, no. Football like this.
No, like this.
Like this!
No Football. Do it like- huh?  Sorry Football. Lessons are over for tonight!
Why so glum fellas?
I know a thing or two about good boys. Why dont you try sticking your thumbs in these holes?No, I don't need anything. Thank you. Okay, goodbye, Finn and Jake!
Finn? Jake?  Well, hello there. Oh, hello! Who are you? My name is Football. What's yours? I am BMO.  BMO, are you a robot?  Oh, no, Football! I am a little living boy! Oh! That sounds wonderful, BMO! Will you teach me about being alive? Yes, Football! Watch me!  Pee-ing! Oh, BMO, that's fantastic!  Oh, thank you, Football! It's really nothing.Stand and deliver, boy, because I'm Robbing Hood. Give me all your funny money, Sheriff of Naughty-hams.
No, Neptr.  Ha ha! Friar Tux would never have a mustache like that.
On Blitzen!
You're terrible!
Whoa!
Eeeee!
Uh...
You got too much money, honey. All of this dosh is threatening the structural integrity of the treehouse.
You should give it to Robbing Hood.
Aw.
Come on, Naughty-Hams.
Ho, ho, ho! Robbing Hood is the defender of the poor!
I was aiming for the rope.  Yeah!Kya! Kya!  Hmm.
Ohhh, that's pretty good. Kya!
But you said 8:00 to 10:00 is my time to do karate. It's my karate time!
Jake...
KYA!
Kya! Kya! Kya!
Finn, Jake! What's wrong?!
Run! Just run!
Hmm.  Kya! Kya!
Is he coming soon?
Theoretically, that is possible.
Jake, I have a radical option. I've been studying a karate move that could temporarily stop your heart long enough for you to fight the ghost on his own plane of existence.
It's okay! I learned it out of a magazine.
Tell me a joke.
Kya!
I killed Jake! Yay, BMO!
Jake! I can't hear you! I will start your heart up in five minutes, okay?  This many!
Jake!
Yes. Yay, BMO. BMO is so good.Jake, if I beat you, you have to call me sensei for a month.
Yay! I win!  Bow to your sensei!Oh no! It's much more dangerous than you think!
Yes, of course, Jake.  If I push this button-
If I push this button, you will both be dangerously transported into my main brain game frame where it is very dangerous!
No! It's a far too dangerous incredible adventure for you! It's final.
Did you have to- oh no! Wait! Run!
Help! Oh no!
I can't, Finn! I'm stuck!
They're too strong! Use the combo move, Finn! The combo-
Finn, I told you about the danger! And now look! You fricasseed my stuff and broke our house all up!Yes, please.
Ahh...Yes, Finn. It goes in my butt!
Can we sit on the floor? I feel so far away from you guys!
Let's peek through the window and check who it is! Maybe it's just pizza.
I am quieter now.
My alarm says it's time for Finn's bath. Finn, get naked.
I cannot self-snooze. It's against my programming.
Press and hold.  Then, press the button on top of my head.  I'm sorry. ...We can still take a bath...
Okay.
Why don't we call others for help?
Ice King is on the phone outside!I think I can break the code, Finn.
Yes. I have detected a noticeable pattern in the tears of sadness that fall from the Ice King's eyeballs.  His tears drop at an equal rate until the thirteenth tear, when the right eye drops two tears instead of one.
The thirteenth letter of the alphabet is M. If I print the letter M every time the Ice King says an M word, it looks like this!
Oh, no!
Finn! There is one more tape!Finn, you're hurting me.
I am terrified of Finn.
Jake! We need the silver baseball!
Oh, Glob! Oh, my Glob, Jake! Mama!
Screamoooo!
There he is!Oh, stop!
It's awesome!If anyone tries to hurt Finn, I will kill them.
Whoooop.... Duck, Duck, Duck, Goose!Yeah! Woo woo!
Okay!
Yah! Unleash the beast!
I am no match for the Jakesuit.Hi, Jake!
Sorry, Jake.Puppies! Puppies! Puppies!
Puppies!
Look! Look!
Who wants to play video games?
I'll be right back!
Did you ruin it?Why am I recording?
Bathtub, bathtub!
Who's gonna scrub me?
Yeah, that sounds makes me feel happy!
I feel it here,  good here!Yay! Birthday story time, please.I did it up big time for you! Hope ya are hungry!
Hello!
Oh, what? Ahh! There's hot grease next to us; don't fool around!
Oh no! Get off of me!
I am fine, Finn. I just thought you kept better company.
Don't touch anything! I'm still frying up garnish!
You guys should get ready for bed.
Guys! Your stanky friend jumped out the window and ran toward the Candy Kingdom!I think someone's knocking at the door.
Yes, Jake.Ouch. I hurt my butt sledding.
I ain't no clown-town snitch, baby.
Alright.
Jake got back with his old gang and is going to rob the Candy Kingdom!
No, I like organized sound.You made it!
A bird! He's a bird!
Dance party!
Awww!
Ow!  No!
You pushed my whole body!Uuf!
Maybe she just didn't get it yet.
Oh no! My favorite window!
Oh, there you are! You found your mug. I thought you said you didn't care.
That mug is empty.
Oh, really?
Jake, you drive a hard burger.
Ha ha he, ha ha he, goodness, Jake, why don't you do this with your other babies?
That really stinks, huh?
Hot chocolate is ready!
. Ha ha! I knew it!Who wants to play video games??
I've created a new game called Conversation Parade.
What do you think about the stars in the sky?
That is an interesting response! Battery low... Shut doooowwwwn...Shh. Just watch. It happens once a monthI promise.
This is it!
That's none of our business.Finn, Jake, I invited some Bikini Babes over to dance to this song!  It's my favorite song, it makes me so happy!  Um, why are you not talking?
What?
Why are you not talking! What happened to Finn and Jake?! You have taken over their bodies!   Oh dang.
Oh oh, what should I do?!
Go away!! Where is the real Jake?! You are doubleganger you- body taker!
No way fake boys! I am never coming out!
Bikini Babes! They're not Finn and Jake! Get them!
Finn? Jake? For real?
Oh, I don't care. Let's just-a party!Go! go! go! go!I am Professor Pants.
No. Uh-Uh.
Ahh!
Hmmm...
Nothing...
Processing... Data!
Oh. Um... I don't have a ghost detecting equipment.  I just like taking nice pictures.
No, Jake. When bad things happen, I know you want to believe they are a joke.  But sometimes, life is scary, and dark. That is why we must find the light. Aha!  Found it!
Help!
Jake help!I thought my body was hopping up and down. But I was sitting still.
Father, it has been a year since I was on the submarine, but, I still hear the screams! I was forced to choose; the lives of my men, or the entire planet! Tell me father, what would you do? I'm a mess, man!Hey Jake, where's...  Where's Finn?
Eeah.Ha-ha! I win!
Five hours.
Yes.
I agree that is when he will probably take a bite.
Oh, you need help? I can help.  Processing.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Ding! I have the solution, Jake.
Yes, this plan will work.
But we have to hurry.
No, Finn. This is the plan.
Jake, you will have your sandwich back before my board hits the ground.
Yay, BMO!  This is iiiii...
...iiiiiiiii...
...iiiiiiii...
...iiiiiiiii...
Boardslide!How's Finn's date?
Unlike your game, boiiiii!This does compute.
About twenty hours.
Yeah, you guys shot a lot of footage. About twenty hours.
Eeee...
Check, please.What's happening?
Nope.
You mean an air-fuel mixture?
Yay! BMO is so pretty and smart!
Not BMO. This grease monkey's torqued up on automotive styles.  Yeah,  boyee!
Time for the night shift.
A lizard?
They are wrong! You look more like a hippo than a lizard.
Stay back, lizard!
Aerodynamics.
You don't have a girlfriend?
Thank you.
Yeah, come on, Banana Man! You're lonely!
He's very smart and very single!
No, Finn! She's a lizard!
Eat this bug!
Kill it!
Hmm...
It's not fair!
It's not like that! Hot Daniel is dead!Noooo!
Ohh!  Oh, my face!
Oh.
Oohh...
Yippie ki-yi-yay!
