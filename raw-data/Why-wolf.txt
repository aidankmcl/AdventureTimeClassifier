Creatures possessed by the spirit of inquiry.....  AND... BLOODLUST!!
Please. Save your questions until the end of the lecture.  Our ecosystem. At the bottom level are the house people. Given the opportunity, we Why-wolves would easily wipe them out. However, Donny's presence is a natural deterrent. His jerkiness is so powerful that it produces a pungent gasobnoxygen. To Why-wolves, it is a deadly poison. But since you've removed the jerk Donny, we will devour the houses, and our population will rapidly swell until we are, in turn, devoured by the Cosmic Owl. Such is the course of nature, but it'll be a pretty sweet ride up until that point.  TONIGHT, WE FEAST ON THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS!
You're so pathetic! So comical!
Obnoxygen cloud!! EGRESS!!
