There you are, Finn the Human.
All right, Finn. My name is Roselinen, daughter of Quilton. You have to call me the whole thing.
Just kidding!
Yeah. Um, you wanna dance?
Dummy, it's a dance, not marriage.
Are you telling me that birds in your world don't poo little pillowcases?
Hey, like this.
Well they're used for that here too.
Jay, Bonnie. I bet your dad's just about finished chopping wool. You guys wanna bring him his lunch?
Psst, Finn, they've brought you lunch.
What's my father doing here?
Oh, Finn. I know you have to go, all these years I've known, but now that it's time...  Oh man, I'm just all messed up about it. Just promise me you'll remember us,  when you're back in your real life.
Finn... Finn.
Are you comfortable?
