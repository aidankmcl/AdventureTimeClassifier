Apples... my apples...
You!  You took my apples!
Finn... and, and Jake?
They took 'em. They took all of 'em.
Apples. My apples that I raised with love from, from mere seedlings. Without my special apples, I won't be able to bake any more apple pies.
Let me show you the crime scene.  You see, boys: scads of apple trees but, but no apples.
No, Finn, they didn't touch my rocks, or my birds, or my flowers, or, or nothing.
Oh, no, Finn. I take great care to assure that-that I'm loved by even the most heinous cretins
Uh!
Ne'er-do-wells? They stole my apples.  I'm gonna sass those boys up nasty!
Okay, you two, let's get going.
Oh, my!
Okay, I won't.
Where's my dang apples?
This, this toilet paper's drying my mouth all up.
Oh, I look just like an army brat!
Finn? Finn.
This could be dangerous, a-and if you want to go back home, I understand, but I need to do this.
Um, sir?  I promise if you let us go, we won't tell no one about your apples.
But we're never gonna find those apples.
With all due respect, Mr. Pig, sir, my apples were stolen by a dirty, rotten criminal who needs to be put in jail.
Well, I hate to tell you this, boys, but there's no apples in this closet.  You see, uh, I'm the only one who knows how to open this closet.
Oh, so I was the apple thief after all.
No, Finn, I'm a criminal,  and I need to pay the price.
Uh, this is Tree Trunks. I've done somethin' horrible, and I want you to come over and arrest me.
Thank you, Finn and Jake, but I won't let myself slip away from such a terrible crime. Goodbye.
Does this mean I'm innocent?
I'ma bake you the biggest and the tastiest apple pie you boys ever tasted.
Uh, you boys better stick around if you want a bite of my apple pie.Oh, hey, Princess. Wow, you look prettier than a sippy cup in a snowbank.
Oh, well, uh, Princess, I appreciate your generosity going to all this trouble to hijack my wedding and all, but you can't perform the ceremony.
Uh, well, I'm sorry, but I just don't recognize your quote unquote authority on such matters. I can only be married by His Holiness, the One True King of Ooo.
Now I know...
Why, yes, but...
Oh, dear. Mama, I'm afraid I've offended the Princess.
Mama, please! Please don't call him a saucy fine bologna factory!
Oh, my perfect day. What else could go wrong?
Shh...
Don't hurry this.
I...
I...
do... oh
Oh!
Princess Bubblegum, you have gone too far. We stand together against your tyranny.
Your prison may hold one of us, but it may not hold all of us.
Oh, poor Tree Trunks. Wait, where's my mama? Has anyone seen my... oh!
No, Mama. Well I guess this is it, sweetie.  Oh, oh no, the elephant graveyard is calling me now. Okay, hold your horses, I'm coming!
Hey yeah! King of Ooo, will you do the honors?
Oh, dear.
Huh?
Yeah, that really stunk.
But... the King's word is law. I can perform my own dang ceremony?
I'll try. I guess it's time. A-are you ready?
Oh. Okay, um... do you Mr Pig take me, Tree Trunks, to be your beautiful wedded wife?
And do I, Mr Pig, take him to be your lawful wedded husband, Tree Trunks?
Then you... you may kiss the bride!
Looks like we got the whole place to ourselves... if you know what I'm saying.
I hope so...Howdy, boys! Nice pillow and nice sword. My hands are full, Finn. Uh, you mind slicin' an apple for me?
Something is terribly wrong with that awful sword.
That apple slicing is too perfect... demonically perfect. That sword is cursed!Yes, Finn, it's me, Tree Trunks.  but in this world I am known as Quartzion the Crystal Queen.
Oh, I'm more than alive, Finn. After I ate that Crystal Apple in the scary dark forest, I was transported to this crystal dimension where I become ruler of the crystal men. And the crystal men are all in love with me.
Yes, yes I know, but you love... is not enough   I wanted you, Finn, so you could be transformed into my sexy crystal king.
Finn, it's not sexy for a king to call his queen bananas!
Whoa there, don't you put your junk on my trunk!
Marry me, Finn, we can snuggle through time and space and kiss each other in an alternate dimensional place.
Oh, dear.
Oh, Jake, I was behaving so inappropriately I'm so embarrassed.
Oh, Finn, I was trapped here for so long and all I could think about was you and how your so nice to me and I, and I just wanted to say... I think... you're cute and I like you.
Finn, when we get home, it's apple pie time.
Apple pie in the oven, Tell me you can taste lovin'Huh?
Oh my, look who's here! Yoo-hoo!
Howdy, Jake! Howdy, Finn!
Mr. Pig's been so kind helpin' me, hehe, tend to my rose garden.
Cool cool cool cool!
Oh, you all are so early that I haven't even started!
There you are, what are you boys chattin' about? Hmmm?
Mr. Pig, what's going on?
Ohhhhh!
Shush. I feel the same. I have a feeling that this is the feeling others call... love.  What should we do then?
Uh... Yeah, Jake, yeah!
Oh Jake, I tried to bake an apple pie, but this cutie kept distracting me.
Princess, how's about a slow song so me and my man can dance cheek to cheek.
Why's everybody givin' me the hairy eyeball?
They don't want us to flaunt what we have?
We're trying to hide our love, but it's so difficult!
But Finn, an unmarried couple living together one roof, that's undecent!
We don't wanna rush things-
-we need time to get to know each other.
Nooo!
Sweet meat!
I don't know what I'm going to do without him, Finn!
Dream of love... Is it really over? Can I overcome these tears? I close my eyes, feel that he's still with me. Still standing with me here...
And even though, we ain't allowed to be together. I cross my heart and promise to be true.
I close my eyes, and feel his arms around me, in my dreams... he's not so far away.Mr. Pig, I think we should get a di
Oh!  Oh, this changes everything!La da da la da da mmm deedle dee...
Oh! He he! Boys. Your manners.  Oh! Whoops! Oh!
Excuse me sir. I wasnt looking where I was-
Oh no! Heavens no!
Yes thank you. I-I heard a man calling out to me Oh Tree Trunks! So I said whos calling? I dont know. So I looked and he was making a RUDE gesture.  It left a sour taste in my mouth!
T...
R...

E!
Uggh! Im sorry, but the wheels of justice spin too slowly!  Im going to have to take the law into my own hands!
Thank you all for coming! The police have failed me in my time of need! So Ive brought you here together. A posse!  I made you all blackjacks  in case things get...uuugly. I stuffed some of my stockings with balled up newspapers. I made a big one for you, because youre so strong.  Alright then!  Lets clean up these streets!  Oh there he is! Oh my goodness!
Oh. Why. Its just a statue. I-I-I dont understand. I-It was so rude before.
Oooh!
Wonderful!Hold on, Sweet Pig Trunks. We're coming.
There, there, Sweet P, it was just a dream.
Now eat up.
Okay, there's your lunch and an apple for the teacher.
Golly, it's awful nice of y'all to take Sweet P to school on his first day.
Yes, how'd ya do?  A gold star?!
Thumbs up! Come on, thumbs up!
Sweet P, uh, we're going on a date. You're smart and educated enough to stay at home all by yourself.
Oh, my, my, where did you get all this bling?
Wow, how nice of those teachers!Yes? Hello?
Oh, yes. A-a-a monster's been stealing my pies off of the windowsill.
Oh, yes, you can see the monster  tracks leading off into the forest.
The monster tracks are very real.  My husband told me so.  Wyatt!
You could just ask for seconds.
Oh, Wyatt.
Oh, no. But the monster is real. He snuck up and rubbed my elbow while I was gardening. And Leftenant Candy Corn said it came in through the window and touched him on the chest. Oh! Oh, now I got myself all scared. W-won't you check around to make sure no one is out there?Oh, we always come here when we want to shake it, Finn. It's the only triple cray-rated disco in all of Ooo.Shelby. Shelby, wake up.
Uh, you've been snoozing on my dome. I just woke up in this room with these fellas: Nectar, Ice Cream, and one of the Lemoncarbs.
What are those awful words?
Beyond this room are a thousand rooms, outside of them still more.
Oh! The room is trying to hug us!  Oh no!
W- We're trapped!
I can make an apple pie for all of us.
If you want a taste of my juicy apple pie you better be nice. You got that?
Okay, that's better, now let's see about this pie business.
All right, gentlemen. Have a look at my luscious, gooey apple pie.
Golly, how we ever gonna worm our way out of this... fishy situation?
Oh, that's warm on my undercarriage.
Bleh! Wow, that was heavy, man.
Aw yeah, I've been reborn!
Let's go then!
Look out,  Shelby!
Oh, step back, you all.
Don't criticize my running, Shelby.
Yes, I'm getting a weird feeling in my stomach, and I think it's 'cause of you, Mr. Wizard you'd better fess up to whatever you're doing.  I got no time for nobody dancing around and acting fool at my expense.  I'm Tree Trunks and people know I'm kind and honest, that's why people like me.
So stop sellin' fib-bibs and give it straight!
What's it do?
Uh, like an ashtray?
C'mon Ice Cream. We-we're leavin'
Oh, Mister Lemoncarb ate it.Oh, I hope it's not bad news.Nice and slow. Ooh, gent--oh!
Oh, I'm flying!Oh, men and their swords... You boys, stop horsing around with my apples!
Now, come on over! I baked y'all an apple pie.
Now, you boys sit down and behave yourselves. Oh!
Shoo, fly! Get off my apple pie! Huh!  A fly landed on my pie. That's no good.  Bye-bye.
Flies wanted it, they can have it.
Anyways, don't y'all worry 'cause the new pie is coming in the wag of a lamb's tail.
Here you are.
Come on, go ahead.
What you think?
Oh, Jake, thank you, but that ain't the best apple pie.
Finn, what would you do if you could do anything?
I would go pick an apple.
This apple ain't like the apples that I pick. They say it's the apple of apples; rarest kind of all. Legends call it the Crystal Gem Apple.
I've Heard that it grows at the deepest end of the Evil Dark Forest.
What? Me? Oh, no I'm just a cute little elephant. I'm not cut out for adventuring.
Really? You think I can handle the Scary Dark Forest?
Okay. I'll do it. Call me... Adventurer Tree Trunks.
I love being so high up from the ground!
I wanna try!
Heeheehee! It's like some cookie dough!
Oh, hello there.
An eye and a mouth. Well, I think I got the perfect thing for him or her... stickers!
Here's a rainbow sticker, and here's a scratch-and-sniff sticker. Smells just like a pickle. Oh, and this one is a holographic unicorn, but it doesn't have a horn.
Oh, now, whatcha doing?
Yes, I thought it needed some tender love and affection. Oh, what a pretty butterfly!
And here's your teacup, and here's my teacup.
And here's your sandwich. Oops, you dropped it.
Oh, hey, Finn.
Patience, boys. There's enough tea for everyone.
Oh, Finn. What a nice hug.
Oh, Finn. That tea party was crummier than a big old biscuit.
Are you mad at me?
J-Jake I think Finn is getting jacked up again.
I think I know a way to help him out.
But I thought Finn told me that I was a top notch adventurer. And my adventurer instincts tell me to seduce that tentacle critter with my womanly charms and elephant prowess.
I'm helping you by tempting this guy with my body.
Even brain beasts get lonely, Finn!
I did it! I helped! I'm the sexiest adventurer in the world!
I'm going home now.
Don't follow me. Oh, Finn... You shouldn't yell at cuties that just wanna help you. OH!
OH!
Finn, I found the crystal gem apple.
That's precious, Finn, and I'll accept your apology if you let me kiss your cheek.
Alright, I promise I will.
Hey! It's my butterfly-friend. That's precious.
Okay!
