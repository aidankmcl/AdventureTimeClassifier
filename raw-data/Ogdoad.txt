Hello, what jazz is this?  Peppermint Butler! That's the last straw! I will fill you with the shadow of a thousand brown portals!
Hey! Let me go first! I got stuff to do today!
Set me free, you tranch!
Say what?
Yes.
He he he he, this I can do, but can you pay the price, Braco?
This price lies outside of our arrangement. To receive, you must pay!
SWAZAA!
