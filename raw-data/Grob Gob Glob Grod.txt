Fire all defense missiles!
Yes! Do you think it worked, Star Man?
Was that all of our missiles?
I'm thinking, Star Man!
Grod, assessment.
We're sunk, bro. This whole place is gonna be a stickin' molten dump in a minute.
It doesn't make sense, every 1,000 years the catalyst comet mysteriously reincarnates itself and collides with Earth, bringing with it an agent of change. But the comet has never been so off schedule and it's never freakin' hit Mars!
What do you think, Finn the Human?
Yes, I am Glob.
No, but sometimes Gob does .  You're dreaming so far from home, it must be comet related.
What's that?
Well, its not enough to have created something amazing, right? What if I just let my Martians' society go to butt?Arise.  Magic Man. You caused nothing but turmoil and chaos to us on Mars. We hoped banishing you to this world would help you see alike to our Utopian supersociety. Now, tell us, what have you learned in these past two hundred years?
Ready.
Yes, but at what cost?
No. I lost a friend. I cannot lose my brother, as well. Hey! What? Where did he go??Denise, we have concluded you're an interesting and conventionally hot woman. My siblings and I would like to request a date with you. Are you available for a date with: Glob on Saturday, Grod on Friday, Grob on Thursday or Gob on Sunday? Please select your dates now.
Definitely going to send these to Denise.
