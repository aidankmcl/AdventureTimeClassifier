You're late, Blue Nose! Get into makeup!
Too much artsy, not enough fartsy. We talked about this, clown!  Heh-heh, wasn't that something? Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, you're perfectly safe. But at this time, I'd like to ask anyone with a medical condition to please leave the premises at once. What you're about to witness with your own eyes may shock and astound you to your very core.
Tonight, I give you the wildest, most dangerous beast anywhere in captivity! The horrible, the stupendous...  Goralina!
Attagirl!
Blue Nose! Boy, am I glad to see you. Come in, come in! Sit down. You did good out there tonight with the belly-dancing routine. Real good. Aw, don't give me that look. I know we said we were going to let the chipmunk go at the end of last season, but Goralina is our big draw. You understand that.
We're barely breaking even herewhat do you want from me?! Look, there's another show in an hour. You come up with an act that can rival Goralina, then we can talk. But look what she got us last night: three whole pennies. Think you can make me this kind of cash? You do that, I won't need the chipmunk anymore. I'll let her go, just like I promised. But you're gonna have to lose the fancy-schmancy stuff and  give the people what they want! Get it?!
The old Blue Nose magic.
Oho! You were great, kid! That's what I'm talking about. With you and the chipmunk in the show, we're gonna have a real one-two punch!
Hey... I know what I said, but I want to see how many boxcars this gravy train has on it.
Look at her. It's like looking at a big, sad dollar sign.
Yipe!
Whoa-ho!
That's right. Lift with your legs first, then put your back into it.
There he is. Gotcha! Thought you could skip out, eh? and start your own circus!
