Hey, King of Ooo!
You are a certified dance instructor, right? Show the kid the dance you do.
Aw, come on. You gotta show the kid. It's awesome!
Ready?
See?! The kid is tough... and ready!
Teeth!
You should come back tomorrow, kid, for more dancin' lessons!
Of course Sweet P understands; he's a good boy!
Thumbs up!
We'd invite you in, but the place is a mess.
I don't know, K.O, they've gone rancid.
Mo' stars means mo' dosh!
And best of all, he doesn't know a thing! Because if he did...
What was that?!
What does it matter?! None of it was good!
We're going to burn down your orchard!
Forever!
Baby-Man, Baby-Man
