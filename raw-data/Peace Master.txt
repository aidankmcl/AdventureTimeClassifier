So...a tinkerer, eh? Fiddling at the fringes of unknown realms. Tell me, Kenneth, will you be ready when the flames of those evil places consume everything you hold dear?!  I thought not!
There is something very wrong dwelling in the Candy Kingdom...a dark entity I plan to purge from the face of Ooo.
Its presence has infected every home, every place of business, even here in this very room.  Yes, this foul creature watches us even.. Now!  I know you can hear me. Tonight your reign ends.  'Cause I am totally gonna vanquish you!
Sorry, I hate evil so much.
Yes. As lone scouts, we may fall, but together we will stand as a mighty force!  Oh, dang. I gotta go.  But I shall return in one hour!
Dun-de-dun-dun-dun, Peace Master! Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
Uh, sorry about the wait, guys. Daddy was pontificating.
No, honey, that stuff is highly inappropriate for kids. Daddy works very hard to protect you guys from that kind of stuff. If you only knew of the monstrosities that lurk around every corner.
Stop laughing! You're stressing daddy out!  See?! See what happens when you mess with the dark arts?  I'll get you, dark one! You wrecked Peace Master's minivan!
You going stinkhouse, baby? Ooh.  Whomp! Almost got me, but my lucky talisman sensed your presence.
Look here, friends. The beast lies exposed!
His powers of darkness made me go crazy and crash my minivan earlier!
Mm?  Ha ha!  In you go! You see this?! My dark wizard gobbler poots evil souls into the void.
Oh. I see how it is. Maybe y'all should get in here, too.  Digest!
Impossible!
You can't time-ou
No! Your dirty hobo birthday tricks won't save you long time! You hear?! You still here?
Then hear my challenge! On the field of wizard battles, armed in my talismans of light, I will destroy you and free my children from the spell you cast over their minds!
See you tomorrow, butler.
Tomorrow!  Peppermint Burfer, show yourself!
You're the momo. Your spells are no match for my righteous charm sack.
My kids!
Noooo!
Son!
I will smite thee.
Nooo!  Alright, alright. Okay, you win.
You fiend.
Please don't make me.
Yes?
