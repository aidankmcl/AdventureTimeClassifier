I need your help. My people are in trouble. I'm a mudscamp.
I'm shy. It took me a while to work up the nerve.
We'll see.  Come, I'll take you to my village.
Here we are: the village of my people. It doesn't have an official name, but I call it South Woobeewoo.  Uh, this way.
This is the village elder. He'll fill you in on the deets.
