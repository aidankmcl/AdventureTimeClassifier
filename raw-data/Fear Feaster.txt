Way to go, Finn the Coward. Still afraid of the ocean, eh?  You should just give up! You're not a hero. You're a wimp-o! A cringing, cowardly
Hey, where you going? Fool, I come with. Ha-ha! I'm gonna nosh on your insecurities. Then I'llI'll squat on your hopes. So now what, little boy?
Huh? Uh, hey, man, don't do anything stupid. Hey! You're too chicken to face your fears with open eyes? This stank is cheating!
No!
Wake up. Wake up!
No mortal blade can harm
What?!I am the manifestation of your fear... fear of the ocean!
'Cause you're a wuss.
Ha! You're too scared of the ocean to ever be a true hero.
Yeah, right.
Of course you will,  and I live in a two bedroom apartment that doesn't smell like vomit  ...Sarcasm.
Pathetic! You can't even overcome your fear now that your friend is about to die! Your un-heroic body will never let you save Jake.
What? Really? You think I'm right? Well, that's... that's great!
No. Wait. No! Noooo!
You've nothing to be proud of, boy! You will never get of your fear of the ocean!
No you didn't, cheater! You just sank to the bottom. You will never be a great hero.
You know nothing, Wise Men!
What? Am I supposed to live in your tummy for the rest of my life?
Wonderful...
