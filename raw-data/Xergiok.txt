This is the rookery, where I and my bird friends dwell!
That's what they call me nowadays. But when I first met you, Finn, and you, Jake, you knew me as  Xergiok, the Goblin King!
When we first met, I was crazy for smacking goblin hams. I was cruel, selfish, brutal. But every thing changed after I was defeated by the two of you!
Oh, no, my change has been deep. And these whatsits are only curtains for empty windows.
I miffed off a wizard, and he took my eyes.  I wonder what he wanted them forsome kind of lotion... or potion... or time-traveling spell. I'll never know. Never, ever, never. But losing my eyesight was only the beginning of my wonderful change! I started meditating and doing yoga. Now I can see with my heart and smell with my soul.
I smell with my nose!
Om.
Oh, Taffy! You heard my call!  Climb aboard, boys.  Taffy will take us to the lower level, and you can have a bite to eat!
Okay, great! Well, follow me!
Nice and cool down here, isn't it? A-ha! Listen to the babies! Num-num time!
There you go, little ones. Suckle, suckle!
They're small, but they sure can take a lot out of you. Whoo! Dizzy. Sometimes feeding really wipes me out. I hope you'll excuse me while I refocus my qi.  See you in a while!
Psychic links! Cardamom, my friend, I'm coming! I'm com  Mother of Gob! Hold on, Cardy!  Okay, here I am, buddy. Ol' Xergy's here.  Let's see now  Aw, dang!
Ah, Finn and Jake, you are here!
I use no magic. I manipulated space with a vibrational chant. You see, now the injury has transferred to me!  Ooh, yeah, that hurts, baby! Whoo! Can't you see, Jake? I love these birds more than I love myself. What am I to the deafening roar of the macro-cosmos? Nothing much. Just a vessel to carry the message of friendship to y'all beasts and dirt!
Yeah, look!  Hello, friends! Go for a ride!
Yes, a wizard stole them.
Tell me what?
Alright. Oh, where are they?
A-ha, what? Good job, guys. Goofin' on the blind guyreal nice!
What my life?!
And these aren't grapes, right?
Hmm. Finn and Jake, could you help me onto Cardamom's back? I would like to be high in the clouds, bathed in the pinks and the blues of the desert twilight, when I restore my sight.
Climb aboard! Vanilla! Chocolat! Cinnamon! Agave! All my friends, to the sky!
Oh, yeah, it's overwhelming. This view takes me back. I always loved the sunset. And the silhouettes of my little goblins lined up to receive their spankings!  Well, the past is the past. I wanna thank you guys for finding my eyes. I don't know where I got that idea about the wizard!
Yes, twenty years.
Yes, things certainly have changed for me in that time. Say, who's ruling the uh, Goblin Kingdom since I left?
Oh, Whisper Dan! That's cool. Cool, cool. Hey, you guys wanna ride back to your crib?
I know, but I was thinkingnow that I'm wiser, I could rule as king again!
Well, you know, I disagree! And I have my army of bird friends, so anyone who disagrees with me should get a  SPANKING!
Oh, yeah, baby!
Attack, birds, attack! Where's the butt on this thing?  That sort of looks like a butt!  Yeah!  You like that? Huh?!  Whoa!
Wait! Cardamom! Nougat! Stevia! Dang!
Yeah, I feel myself hitting bottom again. Yup, okay, here we go.
Here, Finn. Take my eyes and bury them forever. I will not need them again.
Thanks.
It's cool.
I found a girlfriend!  I'm in love! Woo!Shush! You guys can't live without me, right?
Blah!
You may have beaten me this time, but Ogh!
It's spanking time!!! Hiyahhh! Yeah!
Sigh.  Yahhh!
Boom! Hahaha!  Congratulations.
HA HA HA.
Prepare to destroy them all!
Line up for you spankings, goblins!
Who among you has the courage to face Xergiok?
I salute you, foolish warrior! You can be my personal sla
How in the world?
Eat this!  Whoa!  Ha ha, you missed me
