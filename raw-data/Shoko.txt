You know it. Got any work for me?
I can step to that.
I think it's pronounced amulet.
Sounds cool. I'll take the job
Uh... that's okay. I'll just work for coin.
Play dead.
Deader.
Bath Boy Gang.
Yeah, they stole everything I had, but that's okay. My parents always told me that simple possessions aren't the most important things in life.
They told me all you really need is a good computer.
They traded my arm to some tranch for a computer.
What?
What? Really?
Do you have any kids?
You think you can do that?
What are you doing here?!
I'm gaining her trust, you momo. Say... you can help me.
Stay away from me you gang boy! Ahhhhh!
Be cool!
My parents took me to a dojo when I was little... they never came back.
Whoa... what are they?
Yeah!
I like feeling handy.
Oh, yeah? You gonna give me that amulet, maybe?
You made me a man servant?
Oh, no...
No, it's awesome... I can't believe it.
Yeah, I know.  I'm sorry, I gotta go to my room for no reason.
I'm sorry, Princess Bubblegum...
Ahhhhhhhh!
Ahhh... look at that. I got a new arm. That would be cool if I weren't about hit my reset button...
