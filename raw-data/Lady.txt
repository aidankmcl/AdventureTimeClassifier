Jake!
Jake?
Jake!
.   . No. He loves me.
. I like it when you bite me.What's this all about?
Hahaha!  I didn't throw up! This gruel is very adequate.! Hi guys!
You're welcome.
... What are you doing, honey?
,       ? Hey honey, why don't you go outside and have some fresh air with the kids?
! !  2! ! ! !      ! Hey kids! Viola! Jake Jr.! Stop it! Charlie! Kim Kil-Whan! Stop messing with daddy and go inside!
,    .      .  . Jake, you're getting obsessed just all by yourself. Our kids have nothing to worry about.  That's being overprotective.
.    . Ai yai yai! He makes a fuss whenever it's not necessary.
Goochy goochy goo!  , ,    .
!  !   ! Well done, babies! You were awesome!,  . Thanks, I enjoyed it too.
... and then I ate all the peaches in the orchard, and that farmer was sooo angry!
...and that's the end of my story.
Hop on my back and I'll give you a ride home!
Come on my darling. Wrap your legs around me.
Well, light travels from the sun. Then bounces off of our planet and then back into our eyes so we can perceive color.
My body can intercept that light and dance around on it.
Do you wanna try gettin' some Finn?
We thought you were behind us the whole time!
Ooh! Honey pot, we probably couldn't here you because of the cloud density.
Oh, okay.  That sounds nice.
Oh, oh. Uh, I would, but I-I'm in the middle of this game.
I like you too Finn.
Jake what are you doing?
Jake, what's going on with you?
I'm hanging out with Finn because you wanted us to get to know each other better.
Oh sweet potato, I love you BECAUSE you're an idiot. You make me feel like a genius!
? Do you prefer this one?? ?  . , . . What? Me? You gotta be kidding me. Okay, then. I'll play.
! Hello!? Hello?
? Jake? Who are you talking about? Jake?
,  !   !         ? Oh, what are you talking about! He's my boyfriend! Why are you keep assuming my relationship between Jake weirdly!
! .       ! Oh, right! I got something that can be helpful!
! I've got it!
.       .      ! It's a video tape that was made by Joshua long ago. I remembered it because Jake recorded something else on top of it. Skip past the front section!
. Just skip the front section of the tape.
! !! Skip!! Skip!!!
. !            . . I don't think there's any more weird Jake stuff.  Really!  But I can't promise anything, as I haven't seen this tape for years! Sorry for that.
!      ! Wait! I must cast a protective shield around you!
.   . Done, now you're good to go.
Jake!       ! Jake! Why is that ugly chick hugging you!
! Of course I won't!
,     ! What is happening? Did you fall in love with that lady or what!
? Then why did you spend that long time in the pit?
,  .  . Ah, you little troublemaker, I love you, honey.,       ! Hmm. It's so good to get some fresh air on my pregnant belly!
. Don't mention it.
. It's fine.
