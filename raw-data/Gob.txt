He's here somewhere, my brothers. Glob, can you see Magic Man on the sensor?
Now we must return you to Mars, where vengeance awaits thee.
Citizens of Mars, King of Mars...  Today the most notorious fiend in Martian history stands before usMagic Man.
Turn on the dark.  Okay, so we don't have footage of these crimes. But Grod's pretty good at drawing, so... Plague of shadows. Magic Man brought our shadows to life. They attacked us, and ravaged Mars. Very impressive, Grod.
To the plague of the oneness. As we gathered to hold hands and sing our community song, Magic Man cast an evil spell that made our arms grow together. Much suffering ensued. And what about that one time when he turned all the water into hair, and we all got so thirsty we drank it? And when we drank it, we went bald! Many of us did not recover and to this day, hide our losses behind groovy headgear.  Dark off please.
Look!
