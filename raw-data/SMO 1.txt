Intruder spotted! Prepare to vaporize! Vaporize!
Cease fire! No intruder spotted. Vaporization complete.
Allllright, everyone. About face.  Does anyone see the intruders now?  Like I said, vaporization complete. Now let's head back to base. It's donut o' clock.
Hey! You toss me one of them 'nuts?  Ah. Yeah, hey, speaking of goofs? Haven't seen SMO 5681 lately.
Yeah, I hate that goof.  You ever notice goofs always askin' how you're doin'? What is that? Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
Oh! Hey, what are you doing over there by yourself?
Oh, yeah, y'know we've all been there.  So anyway, how's your goofy wife doin'?
Yeah, pretty good, I guess. I prefer something yeastier. The wife is always giving me grief about that. But I mean, what am I, decent?
