Fall.
You are alone, child.  There is only darkness for you, and only death for your people.  These Ancients are just the beginning.
I will command a great and terrible army; and we will sail to a billion worlds. We will sail until every light has been extinguished. You are strong, child. But I am beyond strength. I am the end.  And I have come for you, Finn.
Hello!I have learned much from you. Thank you, my teachers. And now for your... education.  Before there was time, before there was anything, there was nothing, and before there was nothing... there were monsters.  Here's your gold star!Wake up.Ah ha ha ha ha!
I wish- for the extinction of all  li-i-if for Finn and Jake to go back home to Ooo. Huh!? No wait, what's not what I wished for!Shhhh...
