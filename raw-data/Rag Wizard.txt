Faster!
Faster! She's in danger!
Because she's in trouble!
Marceline!
I'm her spirit animal.
She accidentally cast a sleep spell on herself, and now she's trapped in eternal slumber.
I'll transport you into Marceline's mind where you will walk through her memories and find the memory core.
Find the memory of Marceline casting the sleep spell on herself. At your touch, you and the memory will be transported back to reality.
Entering a person's mind can be dangerous, and I don't have any arms. Just legs.  Yeah, there we go... oh.
When you get close to the memory, your forehead will glow. Here, take this.  It's a sack of magic powder. Sit on the couch and sprinkle the powder on your head.
Yep, like that. Feel sleepy?
Good. Sleep now. But know this! If you fail, Marceline will be trapped in eternal sleep... forever!
And ever. And ever.
