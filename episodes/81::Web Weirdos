Finn:  [excitedly] Stunts! [Finn then does a slow, cautious summersault] Hi-ya! [he weakly jumps off a tree and starts to climb the mountain side before carefully going back down. He climbs a small piece of wreckage and jumps off it, and starts running towards Jake offscreen] Yeah!
Jake:  Yo, Finn, look what I found! [Jake is on a giant spiderweb] A vertical trampoline! It's sticky!
Finn:  Dude, it's a spider web.
Jake:  Ohh. Well, cut me out, yo!
Finn:  No way, I'll stunt you out! Whoah! [He jumps at the web and gets stuck] ...I was thinking something else would happen.
Jake:  You got anything sharp?
Finn:  The only sharp thing I had was my fingernails, but you made me cut them.
Jake:  They were too long, Finn.
Jake:  Augh! You broke the skin, dude!
Finn:  I guess my fingernails are really loaaeaeuAAAAHH--! [Finn looks at his hand which has grotesquely long fingernails and Jake starts screaming]
Finn:  Oh, yeah. Sorry.
Jake:  It's cool, man.
Finn:  Can you... stretch us out of here?
Jake:  I'm gonna take a nap while you grow out your fingernails. We'll make our escape when I wake up.
Bug:  You'll never escape! [view shifts down revealing a Bug and a Fly are also stuck in the web] We'll all die in the web.
Fly:  That's the circle of life.
Finn:  That's not a circle. That's, like, a straight line.
Bug:  We don't make the rules, man.
Finn:  Well, don't just give up.
Bug and Fly in unison:  The spiders are back!
Fly:  Try to stay calm. Greet your fate with dignity.
Finn:  We gotta go, Jake! Jake!
Barb:  So what? You're not talking to me now?
Ed:  No, I'm just tired of setting traps all day, solo-style.
Barb:  Why are you mad?
Ed:  I just said I was tired.
Barb:  But you're acting like you're mad.
Ed:  I'm not mad. Oh, look, food... that I caught... in my web... for us.
Barb:  I spin webs, too, Ed.
Ed:  Yeah, I know.
Barb:  I try just as hard as you.
Ed:  Well, go ahead then. Wrap them up for laters. [Barb looks shocked and looks down] What's wrong, Barb?
Finn:  What's going on there, Jake? [Jake snores, still asleep]
Barb:  I can't! You think I'm gross when I spin my web!
Ed:  What?
Barb:  I can see it on your face! Tell me that you don't!
Ed:  Uhh... I uh... You tell me, you don't find me gross!
Barb:  Oh, get stuffed, Ed! [She starts sobbing and walks away]
Finn:  You guys are sad. [Ed starts wrapping the still sleeping Jake with web, the web coming out makes a farting noise] Ugh! What is that sound? Sick, dude! She makes that sound, too?
Ed:  Yeah, I guess, but she never does it in front of me. [Ed finishes wrapping Jake] Anyway, it's not gross when guys do it.
Finn:  Dude, that's not cool. You need to think about what you say and how that affects your lady.
Ed:  How about how she affects me? I love her, man.
Jake:  [Jake drowsily begins to waken] Oh, snap, how long was I out?
Ed:  Can someone tell me why we fight, why she treats me like all I do is make her feel bad? Tell me, Glob, why don't you ever answer me!?
Bug:  It's hard to step outside of yourself when you're enmeshed with another being. [Noticing Bug talking, Ed opens his mouth revealing sharp teeth and picks him up]. Oh, Grod! It's over! It's over!!
Finn:  Wait!
Ed:  What?
Finn:  Umm... [Bug is panicking inside Ed's mouth] Right now, we gotta real-talk about your girlfriend.
Ed:  I don't real-talk with my food.
Finn:  Uhh... [Finn tries to get out of the web for a moment] We real-talk now, or you're going to be as single as your stinky web squirter!
Ed:  Yeah, right. You just wanna get out of my web. All you ever want to do is escape! You're always, like, in cahoots, makin' plans not to be food.
Finn:  I'm not in cahoots!
Ed:  So okay, eat your friend here. [Ed holds Bug towards Finn]
Finn:  [Finn thinks for a second] Okay.
Bug:  No, man! What?! Where's your heart?! Look inside yourself! This isn't you!
Finn:  [whispers] I'm gonna fake eat you, man.
Bug:  [whispers] Oh. Word.
Bug:  [scene shows Finn's teeth not touching Bug] Noooo! Oh, my guts! My guts everywhere! Agh, how could you!
Ed:  [Ed climbs off the web] Okay, man, you've earned my trust. So, let's do this. Real-talk me, bro! [Ed puts his ear towards Finn's mouth]
Finn:  [mumbles] Okay, first off, then, how you're going about this isn't working. Am I right?
Ed:  Ugh, yeah. It's not working. My way sucks.
Finn:  [mumbles] Cool, now we've gotta do damage control. Healing the negs energy at the source.
Ed:  Yes, heal the neg-jerseys in me.
Finn:  [mumbles] Alright, uhh...
Finn:  [mumbles] Go find Barb a present. That'll fix the first neg. Can you do that?
Ed:  Yeah, I can find her a present. If you think that'll help. I don't think it will, but what do I know, I'm just a big ol' dummy who does everything wrong... [Ed crawls away]
Bug:  Whee!
Finn:  You're free! [Bug falls back in the web and gets caught again] Aw, man.
Jake:  It's okay, Finn. You bought us some time.
Finn:  Yeah, think fast, what can we use?
Jake:  There's nothing! Just a bunch of nature.
Finn:  I have a dumb idea.
Ed:  [Ed sighs] Get her a present. Harumph. When was the last time she got me a present? What would she want, anyway? How do I know, we never talk. Jeez, what happened to my life? All my friends are gone. They all got kids now. I don't have kids. All I have is Barb. And she... [he sounds like he's about to cry] treats me like a--a dingus! Wha... Oh, cool! A sword! [Ed approaches the body of a dead knight with a Glowing sword] Wow, neat! [the blade lights on fire as Ed holds it] It's magic or something! We can hang this up over our mantle and snuggle by the fire, huh, like we--like we used to! I'm gonna fix us, Barb! Fix us!
Jake:  Alright, one... two... three!
Bird 1:  Yo what?
Finn:  Shoot!
Jake:  Here comes another one. One two three!
Bird 2:  My eyes! Agh!! [The bird falls through the air into Finn's hand]
Finn:  Ha ha, yes! Finally! [The scene widens showing dozens of spit covered birds surrounding the web]
Jake:  Good job! Last chance for life. Break out!
Finn:  [Finn starts cutting the web using the bird's beak] Yeah, you mommy!
Barb:  Hey, what's going on here! [Barb is now overlooking the web]
Finn:  Nothing. [The bird escapes Finn's hand] Oh, crab apples!
Barb:  Where's Ed?
Finn:  Oh, uh, he's getting you an "I'm sorry" gift.
Jake:  He feels crazy about making you cry.
Barb:  He does? Really?
Ed:  Barb! Barb!
Barb:  Ed?
Ed:  Barb, look! Damage control! Check it out! I wrapped it up and everything!
Barb:  Oh, Ed, I can't believe it!
Ed:  Yeah! Come on, open it!
Barb:  I really just, it's just so unlike you to-- [Barb holds the sword and her expression drops] What's this?
Ed:  It's a sword! I found it in the woods!
Barb:  In the woods?
Ed:  Yeah, it's magical, though. Check out the blade!
Barb:  You got this for you, Ed.
Ed:  No, I got it for us! For snuggles by the fire!
Barb:  We are never gonna snuggles until you learn to appreciate me! [She points the sword at his face]
Ed:  Oh, really? Well, I guess we're never gonna eat again either 'cause I catch the food, and your butt is dysfunctional! Eeh-ya! [He grabs the sword from Barb and cuts everyone out of the web] Go! Run away, food! We don't need you apparently! [The bugs start flying away]
Bug:  Just break up, you guys!
Fly:  Do it for you!
Ed:  Now what are you gonna eat? Huh, Barb?
Barb:  [Close up of Barb's angry face] I'm gonna eat you!
Finn:  Yo, that's wrong!
Barb:  Who cares!
Jake:  We're free!
Jake:  Oh, no. You got that look on your face. You going back to help that fool?
Finn:  His wife's gonna eat him!
Jake:  Spider marriage is complicated. Sometimes, you just gotta mind your own biz.
Ed:  [in the distance] Oh, help, somebody help me!
Jake:  Ugh... Go with Glob.
Ed:  Mercy!
Barb:  You little twerp! Are you stupid or something?
Finn:  Yeah, I'm stupid. But I know something real. You shouldn't eat your husband!
Jake:  [Jake rolls next to Finn] Yo, smoothin' things out?
Finn:  Not exactly...
Ed:  [Ed crawls towards the screaming Barb] Barb! Barb! What's wrong, my love? [She continues screaming and her eyes turn red. The back bulb of her body bursts revealing a white sac and she stops screaming] Okay ...
Finn:  What is happening!?
Jake:  Something we're not supposed to see.
Barb:  Oh, Ed. We're parents!
Finn:  Aw, sick!
Ed:  I think there's hope for us, Barb.
Barb:  We can make a new start, as a family. [They kiss]
Jake:  Nice.
Finn:  Think they're gonna make it?
Jake:  Love like theirs will always find a way. It'll crawl all up over you and drain your body fluids, poisoning you slowly until you pass out. [Finn starts screaming and flailing his arms] Circle of life, Finn... circle of life.
