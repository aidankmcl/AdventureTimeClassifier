Finn:  Get it, get it!
Finn:  [Jumps with a sword.] Yah!
Jake:  [Jumps with a lion-shape shield.] Oooooooh!
Jake:  Get him out!
Finn:  Don't you ever let me catch you here again!
Finn:  Whoo-hoo! Ya ha ha ha ha! [Closes the door] Agh! Ow! [Zooms in to a little splinter] Ooooooow! Agh agh mee duh!
Jake:  Did he get you with his poison stingers?
Finn:  No, I got a splinter from the door.
Jake:  Let me see. Wow, that's a tiny splinter.
Finn:  But it hurts! I'm gonna need some... [Flashes to a different scene with a thimble on Finn's finger] ...finger protection! Thanks, Choose Goose.
Choose Goose:  I am Choose Goose. Come back for some juice! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Finn:  Man, I am so protected right now!
Knight 1:  That is mighty thick. Go on, hit me! [Another knight hits him with a sword and it breaks in half. They clap. Knight 2 makes an okay sign with his fingers and the other knights cheer.]
Finn:  Hey guys! Check this out! Dude, hit me! [Jake punches Finn on the arm] Oww! [Holding his arm] On my armor!
Jake:  Oh. [Punches thimble]
Finn:  [Makes an okay sign with his fingers] Click-click!
Knight 1:  That is but a thimble! This [Hits his armor twice] is real armor! [They all laugh again but Sir Slicer shows up on his horse with birds calling and flying everywhere.]
Finn & Jake:  Wha?
All Knights:  Sir Slicer! [All bow]
Sir Slicer:  Who is the one that bears the thimble? 
Jake:  This dude. [Points at Finn]
Sir Slicer:  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, you foolish boy. Without full body armor, you're weak! You do not look [Makes okay sign with his fingers] Click-click! Ha ha ha ha. Yah! [Rides on his horse away and Finn and Jake run to Choose Goose.]
Finn:  Choose Goose, I need more armor.
Choose Goose:  I've got something for you --[Holds up metal shoe] a metal shoe! Don't ya know you might stub your toe?
Finn:  Uhh, no, Choose Goose. I need...
Choose Goose:  Look here hun. Choose this one to protect your buns [Holds up armor shorts with big butt cheeks in back]!
One knight:  Protect his butt! Protect his butt!
Finn:  [Cheeks turn more red] No, Choose Goose. I want--
Choose Goose:  Don't be meek. What if you fall down and scrape your cheek?
One knight:  Look at his butt! [Falls over] Look at his butt!
Finn:  [Smacks Choose Goose in the face] Choose Goose, I want the most [Makes okay sign with fingers] Click-click armor you have!
Choose Goose:  Ooh, have a look! [Points at the armors with his foot]
Finn:  [Sees one with a skull on the front golden all around that a silver hat with a golden horseshoe on the top red sleeves black over the sleeves and golden things on the side of the hat.] I'll take that one! [Eyes glow]
Choose Goose:  [Gets the armor Finn wants] Wonderful! I'll need a trade of equal value. I'll take the head of your dog friend! 
Jake:  Say what?
Finn:  No way! Choose Goose, this stuff is overpriced!
Choose Goose:  No money for me? How about a poem for free?
Finn:  [Looks at the knights and, cheeks turning red, looks back at Choose Goose] A poem?
Choose Goose:  If you can decipher the poem and complete the trials, you will receive the magical Armor of Zeldron. It is foretold to be totally [makes okay sign with his fingers] Click-click! 
Finn & Jake:  Skadow!
Choose Goose:  [Hands Finn the poem] Your quest begins in the marsh over the hill.
Finn:  Ah, yes! I'm gonna get that armor!
Jake:  Yeah, man, you're gonna do it! [Starts to go and Sir Slicer shows up]
Sir Slicer:  Good luck exposing your soft, vanilla-strawberry skin to the elements, dork! Haaaaaaa! Later, losers! [Goes away on his horse]
Finn:  Ja! [Cuts to another scene] He's just jealous that I'm gonna have cooler armor than him!
Jake:  Yeah, what a bumbleberry!
Finn & Jake:  Whoa! [Comes to a place with lot of curtains]
Jake:  What's the poem say?
Finn:  "The sun nibbles on the clouds, and gum drop tears rain down." I don't get it...
Jake:  [Feels the poem] Hmm... It means that we have to cross that swamp.
Finn:  How'd you understand that?
Jake:  You don't just read the poetry to understand it. You got to [feels it] feel it. Trust me, dude-- I'm smarter than everyone. Now get in there!
Finn:  You're not coming?
Jake:  No way, man. This armor thing is your deal! [Jake stretches over] I'll wait for you on the other side.
Finn:  [starts walking in the swamp] This place will be a piece of... [moves a curtain and sees an old lady taking a shower]
Old Lady:  Aah!
Finn:  Aaaaah!!![face turns red] Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry! [covers his face closes that curtain and opens another curtain, sees another old lady taking a shower] Aaaaaaaaah!!!
Old Lady:  Oh, no! [An old guy walks in]
Old Guy:  [drops his soap when he sees Finn] My most private parts peeped by a boy!
Finn:  Huuuh!!! [Closes that one and opens another curtain and sees a mom giving a baby a shower]
The Mom:  Aah! Pervert!
Finn:  I'm not a pervert! [face turns more red]
The Mom:  You should be ashamed of yourself!
Finn:  I'm sorry! I'm sorry! [his whole face turns red and goes through lots of other curtains and finally gets to Jake. Finn breathes hard] Aah!
Man:  My privates!
Finn:  I'm sorry!
Man 2:  My privates!
Finn:  I'm sorry!
Jake:  You okay, man?
Finn:  No! [Sir Slicer shows up]
Sir Slicer:  Ha ha ha ha ha!
Finn & Jake:  Wha?!
Sir Slicer:  What's the matter, crimson cheeks? Feeling a little embarrassed in the swamp of embarrassment? [Camera turns to Finn] You're so red, you look like a tomato. Ha ha ha ha! [Sir Slicer leaves on his horse]
Finn:  Aahhhh! We'll see who's embarrassed when I get that armor! What does the poem say?
Jake:  [feels the poem] Hmm... Ooh! "The meadow weeps as morning sings of milk and honey and things to come."
Finn:  What does that even mean?!
Jake:  It means we have to silence the echoing in the woods. [they hear echoing and look over a bush to see what it was]
Finn & Jake:  Huh! [They see a Red-faced Monster crying]
Finn:  Aw, man! I don't know how to silence that!
Jake:  All right, I'll handle this one, dude. 
Finn:  No. This is my burden.
Jake:  Then just make her think it's her idea. That's how you make the ladies do what you want.
Finn:  [Walks up to the animal] Hey, Monster Lady! Hey! Stop crying!
The Animal:  Huh?
Finn:  Stop crying because that's what you want to do!
The Animal:  Hu ha huh? [picks Finn up and smiles]
Finn:  Huh?! Ahh!!! Ahh!!! Ahh ahh ahh!!! Ahh ahh!!! [The monster pictures Finn as her baby]
The Animal:  Oho... [cradling Finn back and forth]
Jake:  Ha ha ha! She thinks you're her red-faced baby or something. I think she wants ya to nurse, dude! 
Finn:  Noo!!!
The Animal:  Aaa! Ooh! Mmm! [then Sir Slicer shows up]
Jake:  Huh?
Sir Slicer:  Minstrel? [A lyre player comes out and sings "Finn the Blushing Baby"]
Minstrel:  "He's Finn the blushing baby / His cheeks are bright and red! / Be sure to make fun of him before you go to bed!" 
Sir Slicer:  Grandfathers will sing that to their grandchildren for generations to come.
Finn:  Grandfathers will not sing that to their children! [The monster tries to chop Sir Slicer but he puts up his arm which had armor and hurt the monster's hand]
The Animal:  Oh!
Sir Slicer:  Armor, [Makes okay sign with his fingers] Click-click. [He leaves on his horse]
Finn:  Just wait till I have the Armor of Zeldron!
Jake:  Yeah! Just you wait, weirdo! [Just then, a shadow cast over Jake] Uh, Finn? Uh-oh. [the monster laid on Jake to take a nap]
Finn:  Jake? You okay? Huh? [just then Jake's arm came out of the fur on the animal right in front of Finn and came out the fur on the animals back]
Finn & Jake:  Yeah!
Finn:  Awesome!
Jake:  Yeah!
Finn & Jake:  Whoa! [They came to a door that says "Home of Zeldron's Armor"]
Finn:  Finally! [kicks the door open] Yah! [A ghost appears]
Ghost Man:  Hello!
Finn:  Begone, ghost! I'm here for the armor!
Ghost Man:  First, you have to beat my high score in a game of Drop Ball [throwing the ball in the air]
Finn & Jake:  Drop Ball?
Ghost Man:  Drop Ball is an extremely addictive, high-intensity game designed for people everywhere. Here, let me show ya. [He throws the ball under him, bends down, and picks it up with his butt] Hut! One point. [Finn's face turns red] Two points. Three points.
Finn:  This game looks awful.
Ghost Man:  Oh, no. I absolutely disagree!
Finn:  [to Jake] Dude, let's just kill him and get the armor.
Jake:  How? He's already dead.
Ghost Man:  Here. It's your turn. Now, I don't want you to be intimidated, but my high score is six!
Finn:  Guh! Just -- just toss it on the ground. [He throws the ball under Finn, he put his arms on the ground and tries but couldn't go that low]
Ghost Man:  No, no, no! You're doing it all wrong! Let me show you how the pros do it! [He bends his knees and picks it up] See? It's all in the technique. Now, I'm gonna put a little finesse into it, just to shake things up. [Finn and Jake go to the next room while his back is turned]
Finn & Jake:  Whoa! [they see a big shiny light]
Jake:  Finn, its so beautiful!
Finn:  Yeah -- guess all the embarrassment was worth it. [Then orbs of the light come out]
Orb:  Greetings, young traveler. We know what you seek, and you shall receive it. [The light struck Finn putting him in the air] Behold -- the Armor of Zeldron! It will protect you from evil, even ghosts. [Then the light put it on Finn]
Finn:  Huh?! Aah!! [Which he found out it was a woman's armor] No! Dude, this is lady armor!
Jake:  [Makes okay sign with fingers] Click-click!
Orb:  [Makes okay sign with fingers] Click-click!
Finn:  No! Not Click-click! No more embarrassment! [He takes it off] I don't need armor! 
Ghost Man:  [Kicks door open] You did not watch my Drop-Ball technique!
Finn & Jake:  Huh?
Ghost Man:  I give you firsthand tips that no one else knows, and this is how you thank me?! I absolutely disagree with that! [turns in to a monster-like creature] Raarg!
Finn:  Now what?
Jake:  Put on the armor! It'll protect you from evil, even ghosts!
Finn:  Never! Yaaaaaaah! [Finn runs up to the monster ghost, tries to punch him but goes through him]
Monster Ghost:  [Picks Finn up and starts to take his soul]
Jake:  Hey! 
Monster Ghost:  Huh?
Monster Ghost:  Mama?
Jake:  Uhh... Yeah! [In a high pitched voice] Listen when your mother is speaking to you!
Monster Ghost:  Yes, Mama.
Jake:  [High pitched voice] You should be ashamed of yourself -- a boy your age sitting in this cave alone for thousands of years. You need to go outside and get some sunlight!
Monster Ghost:  But I...
Jake:  [High pitched voice and is pointing] No back talk! Outside! Now!
Monster Ghost:  [Puts Finn down and the monster ghost goes outside, burns from sunlight and then turns back to a normal person]
Finn:  Whoa.
Person:  Oh, thank you, Finn and Jake! You've freed me from the addiction of Drop Ball! 
Jake: [normal voice] No problem, dude. I couldn't have done it without [pointing up] the power of embarrassment!
Finn:  And I learned I don't need armor to be -- [Sir Slicer shows up]
Sir Slicer:  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Look at you losers. Finn, you don't have any armor, and your friend is dressed like a lady! Ha ha ha! So not Click-click! 
Finn:  Well, at least I don't spend my day following a kid around! Get a life, dude! 
Person and Jake:  Ha ha ha ha
Jake:  Good one, Finn.
Person:  Yeah ha ha.
Sir Slicer:  Well, I've... just been in the same areas today. 
Person & Jake:  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Person:  Yeah, right!
Jake:  Whatever!
Sir Slicer:  Be quiet! I -- I am more Click-click than all of you!
Finn:  Come over here and say that to my fist!
Sir Slicer:  Okay, I will! [Gets down from his horse, falls down and lands on side] Whoa! Er... Ugh, this armor's too heavy! Ah, no problem. I'll just prop myself up on this stick. [Grabs a stick] Aghhh! Splinter!
Finn:  Hey, Sir Slicer, maybe you can use this! [He holds up the thimble] Here you go! [Throws it at Sir Slicer's face]
Sir Slicer:  Oh!
Finn:  Free of charge!
Jake:  [Picks up Finn with his butt and flings him on his back] Come on, dude, let's get out of here.
Finn:  Ha ha! [Cheeks turn red] Okay, buddy. 
Jake:  [Flies over Sir Slicer with the armor] Wa-hoo! [Flies over the 3 mountain tops, breaking them] Dude, this armor is totally Click-click!
