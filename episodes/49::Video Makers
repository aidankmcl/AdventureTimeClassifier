Jake:  Don't forget LSP's diet cola.
Finn:  I won't. I really do love Finn and Jake Movie Club.
Finn:  Okay, everybody. Apple juice for Tree Trunks. [She takes the juice] Diet soda for LSP.
Lumpy Space Princess:  [Taking the soda] Ehh.
Finn:  What did you order, PB?
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, I brought my own. [Shows a drink that has a face]
Finn:  Huh.
Jake:  Ice latte for my lady. [Gives Lady her drink]
Finn:  Tomato juice for Marceline. [Gives it to Marceline, who's floating in midair]
Marceline:  Thanks, Finn.
Finn:  Hot cocoa for BMO.
BMO:  [Takes the cocoa] This does compute.
Finn:  And finally, a thimble of milk for Shelby, the worm who lives in Jake's viola.
Shelby:  You can just call me Shelby.
Finn:  Jake...
Jake:  We're so excited that you could be here tonight for Finn and Jake Movie Club's feature presentation...
Finn & Jake:  Heat Signature 3.
Marceline:  Oh, with the submarine?
Princess Bubblegum:  Sounds great.
Lady Rainicorn: ? (It looks like funny)
Lumpy Space Princess:  Get on with it!
LSP:  Princess Bubblegum's in my seat.
Finn:  We decided last time. No reserved seating. First come, first served.
LSP:  Grr. [Sips her drink]
Princess Bubblegum:  What's that?
Finn:  Just stuff that comes at the beginning of the movies.
Jake:  Yeah, that's on all the movies we dig up.
Princess Bubblegum:  I don't know. It seems pretty important, Finn.
Finn:  Alright, let's take a look.
Jake:  Pause, BMO.
Finn & Jake:  "Warning. Federal law provides severe and criminal penalties for the unauthorized exhibition of copyrighted motion pictures."
Finn:  Alright, well, goodbye.
Jake:  Sorry we had to cancel. [They close the door]
Finn:  We've been showing these films unauthorized.
Jake:  But these movies are before the Great Mushroom War.
Finn:  We should still respect authority, mang.
Finn:  Yeah?
Princess Bubblegum:  Are we meeting next week to watch a movie?
Finn:  Uhh... Uh, yeah. Maybe. I think so.
LSP:  Finn, don't cancel movie club! I've literally been having the time of my life.
Lady Rainicorn:  ,  . ("Oh, I enjoyed that so much!")
Finn:  Calm down, y'all. We're gonna have Finn and Jake Movie Club next week for sure. Me and Jake just need to find a movie without that warning.
Jake:  Dude, we never found a movie without that warning.
Finn:  We're not gonna find a movie, Jake.
Jake:  Well, what are we gonna do?
Finn:  [Finds a camera and gasps] We're gonna make one!
Jake:  Wowp!
Finn & Jake:  Movie filming time!
Finn:  Okay, BMO. Turn to your right, and start filming.
Jake:  Start to truck in. Keep going. Keep truckin' in, BMO.
Candy People:  Huh?
Finn:  That was awesome, BMO.
Jake:  Yeah. Fantastic, super.
Jake:  Don't lose her, BMO!
Finn:  Front shot! Front shot! Film the clouds. Don't forget the little one.
Jake:  BMO! BMO, you're gonna miss it! Over there on your right.
Finn:  Oh, we're gonna miss it. Hurry, BMO!
Finn:  Don't lose it. Oh, it looks like it's gonna fall. Follow it!
Jake:  Look over there. Across the river.
Finn:  BMO, forget about the coin. Film that over there!
Finn:  Zoom in. [BMO does] Weird. Let's get some more footage.
Ice Cream:  Like that?
Finn & Jake:  Yeah, perfect.
Ice Cream:  Are you, are you sure?
Finn & Jake:  Yeah, look great.
Ice Cream:  W-w-wait. How about this?
Finn & Jake:  That's even better!
Finn:  Uhh, what do you think?
Jake:  I don't get it. It's just a bunch of random junk.
Finn:  Yeah, I'm not engaged. I need to see something that reflects life as it is, but, you know, entertaining.
Jake:  Yeah, like a romantic comedy.
Finn:  Exactly. An action adventure.
Jake:  Wait, that's not what I said.
Finn:  Let's get to filming!
Finn:  [Through his megaphone] Okay, Slime Princess! In this scene, you're gonna leap over to that vine, swing over the crocodiles, do a triple flip with a full twist and land clean. Don't fall in the water, or you'll get eaten alive. Action!
Finn:  No! No smooching! Cut.
Jake:  I thought it was great.
Finn:  No, we can't use any of it.
Jake:  I think we should use all of it.
Finn:  No, not all. We should throw away the parts where Slime Princess was smoochin'. That was dumb.
Jake:  What?
Finn:  Duuuumb-ah. [Pronouncing the "b"]
Jake:  Okay, you're having a picnic, you're in love but you can't admit it. So you're having a playful food fight. And action.
LSP:  Why did you do that?
Jake:  Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut, that was not what I wanted!
Finn:  That was awesome! We need to shoot more stuff like that.
Jake:  [Sigh] What's next?
Finn:  Okay PB, move back a little. [She does] Stop. [Repositions the frog and the chariot]
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn.
Finn:  Yeah.
Princess Bubblegum:  How does this work?
Finn:  Umm, Jake's gonna get the frog to hop towards him [Jake is standing with a stick with a fly tied to it] and when he does, you're gonna run along side the chariot and it's gonna look like you're driving it.
Princess Bubblegum:  Okay.
Jake:  Hey Finn.
Finn:  Yeah.
Jake:  How 'bout when the chariot takes off, she says something like, "Mmm, check, please."
Finn:  What? No, that's terrible. [Jake looks annoyed] And action!
Princess Bubblegum:  Check, please...?
Finn:  Hah, Jake. You... you brought the fly in too close!
Jake:  I'm sorry.
Finn:  Well, help me catch 'im.
Jake:  Well, I thought it was funny.
Finn:  This isn't a comedy!
Jake:  Not the way you're shootin' it.
Finn:  Look, just help me catch this guy.
Jake:  All right, but after this we do my part.
Jake:  [Through a megaphone] Okay, everyone. It's been a long day. A lot of... [Chuckles] A lot of running around, chasing frogs [chuckles again]. But we are makin' a movie and this is the big wedding scene. Mr. Cupcake, playing Todd Johnson.
Mr. Cupcake:  Yes.
Jake:  And Lady, you confess that you never loved Todd Johnson and that you were just trying to win a bet with your snooty socialite friends.
Lady Rainicorn:  , . ("Okay, Jake.")
Jake:  And then, you both realize you do love each other and you both say "I do." And then Shelby, you say...
Shelby:  Check, please.
Jake:  Heh, heh, heh. Yeah. Don't forget to look right at the camera and slap your cheeks like this. [Slaps his cheeks] And 1, 2, 3 action!
Shelby:  Do you, Todd Johnson, take this Rainicorn to be your lawfully married wife?
Jake:  Lady! Cut! Cut, cut, cut! [To Mr. Cupcake] I didn't tell you to flex out!
Lady Rainicorn:  [Rubs Jake's head] ,  . ("Don't take it seriously, honey.")
Jake:  No, I don't like the way he's flexing at you.
Mr. Cupcake:  I don't hear her complaining.
Jake:  Why you... GAAH!
Shelby:  Check, please.
Finn:  How much longer till you finish editing, BMO?
BMO:  About twenty hours.
Finn:  Twenty hours?!
BMO:  Yeah, you guys shot a lot of footage. About twenty hours.
Finn:  Jake, let's talk about our movie.
Jake:  Okay.
Finn:  I think we shot a lot of great stuff.
Jake:  Uh-huh.
Finn:  But I'm thinkin' only half of it is usable.
Jake:  Me, too.
Finn:  Really?
Jake:  Yeah, I was just thinking that.
Finn:  That's great!
Jake:  I know.
Finn:  You actually agree it's an action adventure!
Jake:  Yep...wait! No!
Finn:  What?
Jake:  Romantic comedy!
Finn:  What?!
Jake:  What do you mean "what"?!
Finn:  Who's right BMO?
Jake:  Yeah, me or Finn?
[BMO clicks a button on himself, his face is replaced by a message: "BACK IN 5 MINUTES"]
Finn:  We'll ask him when he wakes up.
Jake:  Why wait? [Pulls out a pen and paper and begins writing] "Dear BMO, Please use only the best footage when cutting the movie. Love, Jake."
Finn:  "And Finn."
Jake:  See you at the movie club, then.
Finn:  Oh, I'll be there.
Jake:  As will I.
Finn:  As will I, as well.
LSP:  Yes. Oh, yes. Oh, I can't wait. Oh, I can't wait!
Jake:  Heh heh. Alright, thanks again everyone for coming to... [Singing] movie night! I hope y'all are in the mood to laugh.
Finn: I hope y'all are ready to be on the edge of your seats for tonight's action adventure film.
Jake:  It's, ahh, it's more of a romantic comedy. Right, BMO?
BMO:  Eeee...
Finn:  Well, I guess we'll see!
Jake:  Yeah, I guess we will. Start the movie, BMO.
LSP:  [Whispering] It's a little awkward.
LSP:  [Whispering] Oh, my gosh!
Finn:  BMO's right. Fighting over this movie junk is dumb. I'm sorry, man.
Jake:  Me too, dude.
LSP:  Oh, my gosh, you guys. I can't wait 'til next week's movie club.
BMO:  Check, please.
