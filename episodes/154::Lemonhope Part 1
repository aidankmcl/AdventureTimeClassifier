Earl of Lemongrab: Hello! And keep away from Castle Lemongrab!
Lemongrab: How are you today? Mm, I see. Yes. I'm inside my fortified totalitarian city-state. Hello, I'm Lemongrab.
Lemongrab 2: [from inside Lemongrab] Me too!
Lemongrab 2: Ow!
Lemongrab: Mm. Unacceptable.
Lemongrab: Things have never been better here at Castle Lemongrab.
Lemongrab: I have never been fatter.
Lemongrab: And since the expulsion of Lemonhope...
Lemongrab: We have reached peak societal obediency.
Lemongrab: Law, order...
Lemongrab: Harp-smashing.
Lemongrab: We've have it all!
Lemongrab: Mm, the pleasure. Smash another! Ooh, who is this?
Lemongrab: [speaking for the Lemon Person] I'm one of my subjects! I'm being punished for helping Lemonhope. But that's okay! [turns him upside down and smiles similarly]
Lemongrab: Yes, morale has never been higher since we got rid of hope. In conclusion, no one needs to come here ever, especially Lemonhope, and I ate my brother. Goodbye!
Lemongrab 2: Save us, Lemonhope! You're our only lemon-ho!
Princess Bubblegum: Lights on. [The lights turn on.] Oh, Lemonhope, were you even paying attention?
Lemonhope: Mmmmmm, yes. [draws shades on his self portrait]
Princess Bubblegum: I know this is a lot to take in, but one day, saving those lemons is going to be your responsibility. They're in trouble, and you need to work harder at this.
Lemonhope: Eh... [groans] I don't know. I'm not too worried about other people, I guess. Like, I got me, and they got them. Mm.
Princess Bubblegum: O-kay... Let's try something else. [opens a drawer and takes out two cupcakes] These are cupcakes.
Finn: Cup-cups!
Princess Bubblegum: Lemonhope, [gives him both cupcakes] you have two cupcakes. Finn has no cupcakes. Lemonhope, will you give Finn one of your cupcakes?
Lemonhope: Um...
Finn: [whispers] Yes.
Lemonhope: Oh... but I don't want to! I want both cupcakes. Finn can get his own cupcakes! [licks thumb and jabs it into both cupcakes]
Princess Bubblegum: [sighs] Maybe we need something more hands-on. Hey, Finn, listen, that's it for class today.
Finn: Whoop! [runs out] Whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop...
Princess Bubblegum: [shouting after him] But read the next three chapters of your geometry text! Well, at least he's street-smart. [pats Lemonhope's hair] Okay, dude, we're going on a field-trip.
Princess Bubblegum: This is the Lemon Earldom perimeter. Unfortunately, there are pacts and treaties preventing me from getting any closer. We should cloak. [hits a button on her and Lemonhope's wristbands, turning them invisible] I know you don't like thinking about Castle Lemongrab, but it's where your family is. They set you free, and now they're being punished for it. It rips. Look!
Lemon Person: Remember, Lemonhope!
Lemongrab: I'm going to eat you!
Lemongrab: I did it!
Princess Bubblegum: D'ya see? They helped you. You have to help them now. It's your responsibility.
Lemonhope: No! I don't have to do anything that I don't want to. They set me free, and free means I decide what I do, not them and not you!
Princess Bubblegum: Dude, I'm sorry, but that attitude is unacceptableoh! I mean... [sees that Lemonhope left] Lemonhope?
Lemonhope: Lemonhope's got feet that take him to fun. [toots flute] Lemonhope's got meat that's warm in the sun. [plays flute] Lemonhope's got no future plans, fully undeterred. No shirts, [pokes owl with flute] no pants, [pokes owl] no "won't"s, [spills owl's water] no "can't"s.
Lemonhope: My body's free like a li'l baby bird. Caw! Lemonhope's got legs that'll strut hot struts. Lemonhope's got thighs that'll pump both butts. He's... got a harp, s'got a flute, free to strum, [kicks bird's nest] free to toot! Free from PB-gum, I'm a lemon of [drums belly] freedom! [climbs down rocks toward a burning village] Oh. It's warm.
Pirate: Pick it up, you chumps! We've got to make Deaveston by brunch.
Lemonhope: Oh, man, that thing looks just lousy with freedom... straight-up right out the diddle-doo, comin' at ya right straight up. Ha-ha!
Lemonhope: Yeah, exactly. [sees a crate of limes] A-ha-ha-ha! [picks one up] Wha-a-at? Okay... [laughs] It takes all kinds, I guess! [sucks on the lime, lies down, and plays his harp]
Pirate: Argh! A Greed Lard!
Lemonhope: [groans] Oh, my fontanelle. Hello? II accidentally came on to your boat, [emerges holding his broken harp] butbut I think I really need some help.
Lemongrab 2: Hey. Hey, guy. Back here.
Lemongrab 2: Hey, c'mon, I've fallen off back there. Guy? Hey, buddy.
Princess Bubblegum: Psst. Down here.
Princess Bubblegum: Psst. Lemonhope, it's me. You are... You are unacceptable!
Lemongrab 2: Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy...
Lemonhope: [laughs] A lot of nightmares again. I guess that's freedom for you. Oh.
Lemonhope: [yawns] Mm. [smacks lips] Thirsty. [gets up and walks to a counter] Nothing like juice for breakfast. [squeezes a dry slice of lime] Oh. I guess that's the rest of those. [throws it on a pile of dry slices] Well, I guess if there's no juice, I got freedom to go find water. [laughs weakly then frowns]
Lemonhope: Huh. Weird cloud's still there. [shakes fist] Couldn't rain a little, could ya? Huh, cloud? Eh, what are you gonna do? Freedom not to rain, I guess. [He leaves the ship and wanders through the desert. After walking awhile, he is now lying face-down in the sand and scooting himself along.]
Lemonhope: [singing weakly] Lemonhope's got meat that's warm in the sun. My lemon of... [hoarsely] freedom!
