Finn:  [Comes towards Jake who is sitting and playing his video-game] I'm here just in time! [Get's catapulted by Jake's hand.]
Finn:  [Singing angelically] Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa......
Jake:  [Shocked] Whoa!
Jake:  [Points to Finn.] Don't let the dragon, drag on, man.
Finn:  [Nods] Mhm.
Finn:  [Randy hands Finn a rock] Thanks!
Randy:  Sign my rock.
Finn:  [laughs] Okay.
Candy Person #1:  [Runs up to Finn] FINN! [Chunters] HAVE DINNER WITH ME! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! FINN! [Keeps saying please until Finn responds.]
Finn:  Sure, man. Yeah. Sure, sometime.
Candy Person #1:  [Cries from happiness] How about... EVERY NIGHT! THIS WEEK!
Finn:  Well, maybe one night.
Candy Person #1:  [Clears tears and stops crying] C'mon, man! Every night!
Randy:  No, man! You get out of here!
Candy Person #1:  [Punches Randy in the face] BOOM!
Finn:  Hey, y'all! Don't fight!
Jake:  [Whispers to Finn] We should get out of here, Finn. I think someone called the heat.
Candy Person #1:  [Shouts] HAVE DINNER WITH ME! HAVE DINNER! I WANT DINNER! FINN!
Finn:  Sucks!
BMO:  [Runs up to Finn] Finn, can't go outside today?
Finn:  I guess I could. I just don't wanna deal with those guys right now.
BMO:  Ooooohhhhhh.... Deal with me! [Goes and puts on a robber outfit] Let's play, [Excited tone] Cops and Robbers! [In a thief's voice] Give me your bank account! Bang! Bang! [Trips over] Reach for the roof and give me all your gold bricks.
Finn:  [Playing along] Ah, okay, okay, don't hurt me!
BMO:  Don't worry, Finn. [Takes off the mask] It's only me, BMO! I'm wearing [Exciting tone again] a disguise!
Finn:  [Chuckles] Hmm....
BMO:  [Crying] Your beauty's destroyed!
Finn:  Hot job! BMO, how do I look?
BMO:  [X eyes] Like the devil!
Jake:  Whoa! Intruder! Finn! There's an intruder in here!
Finn:  No! [Takes his mustache off] It's me! It's Finn! [Put's it back on] This is my alter-ego.... Davey Johnson!
Jake:  Ohhhhhh.
Finn:  I'll dress up like this so no one bothers me about being Finn.
Jake:  Do you think that'll goin' to do the trick?
Finn:  I dunno! [Jumps out of the treehouse]
Candy Person #1:  Is that Finn?
Finn [Davey]:  Hello! Ahem, hello, hello, helloo...... ahhhhhHHH [His voice scales through several autotuned octaves] [Davey's voice] Hello! I'm Davey!
Randy:  Oh, I thought it was Finn on account of he's wearing Finn's exact clothes.
Davey:  [running through the Candy Kingdom] Hi! I'm Davey!
Candy Person #15: Ah, so what?
Davey:  You wanna have dinner with me?
Lollipop Girl:  Go away, weirdo.
Davey:  Haha! [Runs up to the bike store and then runs to the end of the street. He turns around and runs back. He grabs 3 coins out of the fountain. He then walks up to Cinnamon Bun who is dancing. Then he goes and sits on a bench and starts eating a coco bird]
Coco Bird Vender:  Hey! You've gotta pay for those, man. I'm trying to run a business here!
Davey:  [He walks up to the vender and hands him the bird.] I gotta find a job! [Runs to the fountain and tosses the three coins back in it. He enters the broom store] I need a job!
Broom Store Owner:  Can you sweep a broom?
Davey:  You betcha! [He grabs the broom and sweeps the small brooms]
Davey:  Jeez louise! Quittin' time already?
Broom Store Owner:  Sure is, Davey.
Davey:  Take 'er easy, boss.
Broom Store Owner:  Goodnight, Davey.
Finn:  [Takes off his mustache] Man, today was awesome. Just normal, y'know? Just like a normal day. No drama, or any of that. Just super normal. Man it was great.
Jake:  [While lying in his bed] That's cool. Goodnight, Finn.
Finn:  [Puts on his mustache] I'm Davey.
Jake:  Haha! Yeah.
Davey:  I'm Davey! [Eyes turn big.]
Jake:  [Wakes up] Hey, Finn, you wanna have dinner instead of breakfast today? Finn? [Wiggles his ears] That must be him. [Gets up and goes to the door]
Candy Person #1:  I MADE YOU DINNER, FINN! WHERE WERE YOU?!
Jake:  [Opens the front door. Walks up to Davey] Uhh.... What's going on?
Davey:  Oh, heya, mister, thanks for putting me up last night. I'm just chopping some wood so's I can build a little log cabin to live in.
Randy:  [Walks up to the scene and grabs the chopped wood] Hey, I'm Randy.
Davey:  Randy, wanna get dinner tonight?
Randy:  Nah, I'm busy. I like to wonder at night.
Jake:  Finn what's going on?
Davey:  [Takes Jake to the other side of the half-built cabin. So he can talk to him in private] You gotta start calling me Davey, mister. Because that's my name!
Davey:  [Large-eyed] Daaaaaaaaaavvvveeeeeeyyyyyy!!!
Jake:  Oh, no! Have you lost your teacups, man?
Davey:  Mister, I don't know nothing about that. I'm just a working joe... trying to stake my claim... under the sun... and look out on the beautiful green fields called... life!
Jake:  Uhhhhhhhh........
Randy:  Hey, Davey, where do you want these logs?
Davey:  Oh, just attach 'em to the cabin. Like how it should be. So it looks like a cabin. We're gonna build a right wall and front wall. Ummmmm-
Randy:  How about the roof?
Davey:  Maybe, maybe.
Randy:  I've been holding these.
Davey:  They look good.
Randy:  How do you put good looking wood on a cabin?
Jake:  Gotta figure a way to get Finn to act normal. [Then he sees BMO running in circles dressed as a robber]
BMO:  Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pewwww.....
Jake:  Ah! Give me the wallet! Or feel my claw! The wallet!
BMO:  Watch out! A robber!
Jake:  I'll cut you! I mean, rob you! [Takes randy as a hostage]
Davey:  Oh, no!
Jake:  I'm a robber and I'm gonna rob this guy's life! And there's nobody who can stop me. Unless there's a hero around here. [In a suggestive tone] Like there's someone here who is actually a hero in disguise. They can probably stop me. [Runs up to Davey and whispers] C'mon, Finn. Be a hero.
Randy:  What? What are we talking about?
Jake:  Butt out, Randy!
Randy:  [While being pulled back] Uhhhhhhhhhhhh.........
Jake:  [Whispers.] Yes, Finn. Put on your awesome hat and beat me up.
Randy:  What?
Jake:  I'm not talking to you, Randy!
Davey:  [Comes out of the cabin] I called the police.
Jake:  Wait, what?
Jake:  Guys, it's not what it looks like! That guy isn't really named Davey. It's Finn! He brainwashed himself to become Davey and I was just trying to inspire him to go back to being Finn.
Banana Guards:  Yeah, yeah. We've heard that before. C'mon robber!
Jake:  [Shouts to Davey.] Finn, don't let the dragon drag on, man. Don't let the dragon drag on!
Davey:  [In Finn's voice] Don't let the dragon........ Jake!
Randy:  [While drinking his soda and sitting on the rocking chair] Well that was pretty unusual, wasn't it, Davey?
Davey:  Get outta here Randy! [In an exasperated tone and angry expression] Geeeet ouuuuut! [Hits a glass against the wall]
Davey:  [Takes off his mustache and starts talking to it] No more Davey.
Mustache:  But you love being Davey.
Finn:  I do love being Davey, but being Davey caused Jake to get arrested.
Mustache:  But remember that time when Davey sat in the park and saw some people walking around?
Finn:  Yeah, that was nice.
Mustache:  And remember that time when Davey swept the floors?
Finn:  [Chuckles] Yeah, that was great, too. But-
Mustache:  Do you really wanna go back to being a famous hero? Why not just be Davey? A simple man... with simple goals and simple problems. You can just blend in and live the simple life.
Finn:  Yeah.... Blend in. Y'know, maybe I'll be Davey just one more time! [Puts the mustache on]
Davey:  One more time!
Banana Guard #1:  C'mon, man! That last game wasn't fair.
Banana Guard #2:  How about: Who can hold up their hand the longest?
Banana Guard #1:  Okay, this game breaks the tie.
Banana Guard #2:  Okay.
Banana Guard #1:  Last game.
Banana Guard #2:  Last game.
Davey:  Hey, fellas. How's tricks?
Banana Guard #2:  Hm? Oh, hey Davey.
Davey:  [Goes next to Banana Guard #2 and whispers to himself] Ah! Keys! [Touches the key with his broom]
Banana Guard #2:  Hm? [Starts shivering] What's going on?
Davey:  Ah. Would you care for a body sweep?
Banana Guard #2:  Umm... yeah... sure. I do feel kinda dirty.
Banana Guard #1:  Whew! You sure know how to party, Davey! [The guards are struggling to hold their arms up]
Davey:  [Knocks the keys into his pocket with the broom]
Banana Guard #2:  [Cheers because he's winning] Yes yes yes!
Banana Guard #1:  No no no!
Davey:  [Walks up to Jake's prison while the banana guards are distracted. He opens Jake's prison door open with the key]
Jake:  Davey?!
Finn:  No, it's me, [Finn's eyes grow big] Finn!
Jake:  Finn! [Walks up to Finn]
Banana Guard #2:  [Comes to Jake's prison] Here's your meal, criminal. We feed our criminals. [Realizes the prisoner is free. Drops the meal] Hey, stop!
Finn:  [Puts Jake's robber clothes on a candy horse and sticks his mustache to the back of the horse. He takes his hat out and puts it on, then waves to the mustache] Goodbye, Davey.
Mustache [Davey]:  Goodbye, Finn.
Banana Guard #2:  Hey, there they go!
Banana Guard #1:  Yeah, there goes Davey and the criminal.
Finn:  Good luck catching those guys!
Banana Guard #2:  [Shouts out to Finn] Thanks!
Jake:  [In Finn's pocket] Glad to have you back, buddy.
Finn:  Word.
