Jake:  You've got a lot of meat, Wildberry Princess.
Wildberry Princess:  Yeah, well, you know.
Finn:  Thanks for cook-a-looking for us.
Wildberry Princess:  Oh, you're welcome, Finn, and thank you for answering my urgent summons.
Finn:  Hey, yeah. How can we aid thee? [Eats a piece of pie]
Wildberry Princess:  Oh, it's nothing really. Someone's trying to kill me.
Jake:  Still tastes good.
Wildberry Princess:  It's no big deal. Finish your pie.
Finn:  It is a big deal, and I demand deets.
Wildberry Princess:  Okay.
Jake:  [Mouth full] I'm listening, but I'm gonna keep eating. [Chews pie tray]
Wildberry Princess:  [Goes over to a table] I suspect that I've been targeted by the Guild of Assassins.
Finn:  Whoa, how do you know?
Wildberry Princess:  I found this note stabbed to my door... man. [Lifts up a note from the Guild of Assassins with a knife pierced through it]
Finn:  [Gasps] Princess, we vow to protect your juice. Right, Jake?
Jake:  Sometimes, I think there's a monster who lives in my stomach, and that's why I'm hungry all the time. [Giggles and continues eating]
Finn:  Uhh, Princess, let's continue this briefing outside. I can't look at his mouth when he gets like this.
Jake:  [Whispering] Princess, want me to finish off your pie? [Jake stretches his hand into a Wildberry Princess-shaped puppet and imitates her voice] Yes, Jake. All my pies. [Jake begins to eat the pie when he sees something inside it. He continues eating to find a small cat] Hmm...hehehehehehe, a tiny cat. [The cat hisses and bares her claws at Jake] Whoa!
Me-Mow:  [Jumps on Jake's face] Quiet! Or you die! [Points a syringe of poison at him].
Jake:  [Gasps] You're the assassin!
Me-Mow:  [Saluting] Me-mow, assassin second class, ...but once I take out a princess, I g'aduate to full membership.
Jake:  Well, I'm no princess, sister!
Me-Mow:  Yes, I know, but since you've blown my cover, you will slay Wildberry Princess.
Jake:  What!? I'd rather be injected with poison!
Me-Mow:  Oh. Uh... okay.
Jake:  I mean, I will assassinate Wildberry Princess.
Me-Mow:  Good. Oh, and if you try to trick me, I'll poison you. [Climbs into Jake's nose]
Jake:  [Stifled] My nose! [It should be noted that until otherwise noted all lines from Me-mow show her inside of Jake's nose]
Me-Mow:  Blagh! It's like worn garbage up in here!
Wildberry Princess:  You done in there, Jake?
Jake:  Oh, uh, yeah. So, um, Wildberry Princess. So, maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be killed.
Wildberry Princess:  [Nervously backs off] W-w-why would you say that?
Finn:  Dude, are you trying to freak her out?
Jake:  I don't know. I'm just thinking out loud here.
Finn:  Are you trying to freak me out?
Jake:  Uh, I'm sorry, Wildberry Prin...cess... [Hears bells, looks at a bag of meat, grabs Wildberry Princess's crown] You should... let me... do something... and... it will be...good. [Places Wildberry Princess's crown on the meatbag]
Me-Mow:  What's going on out there? [Looks through Jake's nostril to see the meatbag with Wildberry Princess's crown]
Jake:  [Punching the meatbag] Eat this! And that! Ooh, how do you like this, Princess! Duoo!
Wildberry Princess:  [confused] Uh... That's very good?
Jake:  I'm gonna pick you up now and carry you... to the window!
Finn:  Jake, what are you...
Wildberry Princess:  No! Stop! Please!
Jake:  Wildberry Princess is dead! [Puts a finger to his mouth] Shh... [Gives a thumbs up, Finn and Wildberry Princess are speechless]
Me-Mow:  You did it! Well done! I guess I'll be on my way.
Wildberry Guard #1:  Princess! Oh, Princess! [Wildberry guards rush into doorway]
Wildberry Guard #2:  You're alive!
Wildberry Guard #1:  We saw your crown next to a pile of dirtied meat, then we skipped on the meat and I thought I tasted your juice, but it was just blood from the meat. We're so glad it wasn't actually you!
Me-Mow:  [Angry yell] Grraa!! You liar! [She injects Jake with the half of the poison from the syringe]
Jake:  [pained groan] Oooh! [Jake collapses over and his skin tint turns green]
Finn:  Jake?
Me-Mow:  Okay, Jake. I've injected you with half the poison, you'll be dead in thirty minutes, unless you kill the princess, which is when I'll give you the antidote [Me-mow holds up a tube of pink liquid with her tail]
Jake:  Finn [grabs Finn's shirt] help me!
Finn:  What's wrong?
Me-Mow:  If you say anything, I'll stab you in the brain!
Jake:  Uhh... Finn, uh, sing mom's lullaby. I'm so tired, Finn, from the meat. Please, you have to lull me to sleep.
Finn:  Uhhh...
Jake:  I know you carry mom's music box around in your backpack!
Finn:  Dude, I'm not going to sing mom's lullaby in front of other people...
Jake:  Please, pleeeaaase...
Finn:  Alright, real quick while the princess is distracted. [he pulls out the music box and starts playing it; he begins singing "Sleepy Puppies"].
Jake:  [Jake catches Finn with his hand jolting him awake] [whispers] Finn there's an assassin in my nose and she poisoned me and is making me kill Wildberry Princess!
Finn:  Dude, stop playing games! This is serious!
Finn:  Cat... noise? Oh, cats go "meow." Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow.
Jake:  Shh!
Finn:  Meowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeow!
Jake:  Shh! Shh! Shh! [Finn continues]
Finn:  [muffled] Jake! Jake! What are you doing?!
Jake:  [whispers] Sorry... [Jake throws Finn out the window onto the meat from earlier] [whispers again] Me-mow? Still asleep?
Me-Mow:  [asleep] Gonna double cross Jake... and leave him to die...
Jake:  Phew... If I can just grab that antidote... [He pokes Me-mows face twice then grabs it] Ah-ha!
Me-Mow:  [asleep] Puppy... hoodies...
Jake:  I did it!
Finn:  What the flop, Jake!
Jake:  [quiet] Noooooo!!
Me-mow:  Treachery! Hiya! [Me-mow injects Jake's hand with more poison]
Me-Mow:  Time's running out, Jake! Do you want the antidote, or not?
Finn:  What is wrong with you!
Jake:  [Clearly intoxicated] Hey, everybody, everything's cool...
Finn:  Everything's not cool, Wildberry Princess is still in danger!
Jake:  Right, right, well, we should take her somewhere safer...
Me-Mow:  Don't make me give you the rest.
Jake:  I know where to stash you, princess. Follow me. [Jake walks out]
Jake:  Here, nobody can take us by surprise. Finn, stand here with your back to the cliff. I'll stay with Wildberry Princess. [gravely] To do what must be done. [He prepares his hands to push Wildberry Princess]
Wildberry Princess:  Oh, my, look at how close to the edge I am!
Me-Mow:  Do it, Jake, do it!
Jake:  I...I...I probably shouldn't!
Finn:  Huh? Jake!
Jake:  [Falls over weakly] I'm full of poison...
Finn:  The assassin!
Me-Mow:  The name's Me-mow.
Finn:  If you let Jake die, so help me I will kill you too!
Me-Mow:  Try it, oaf!
Finn:  Give me the antidote!
Finn:  Face me, cat!
Finn:  Ugh, ow!
Wildberry Princess:  [shrieks, bent over the weakened Jake]
Finn:  Give it up, Me-mow! You're only making my face look cooler!
Me-Mow:  You're at my mercy!
Finn:  Ha, you think you're hurting me? With that tiny dagger?
Me-Mow:  We'll see who's laughing when you're blind!
Finn:  It's over! Give me the antidote!
Me-Mow:  What, this antidote? [Me-mow breaks the antidote on the tree]
Finn:  No! You... milk-lapper! [Finn punches Me-mow out of his grip] Jake, come lick this treebark!
Jake:  I'm coming-- [he starts crawling, but immediately puts his face to the ground]
Me-Mow:  Forget it, kid. I gave Jake enough poison to kill a dog fifty times his size.
Finn:  Oh, no... [starts crying next to Jake]
Finn & Jake [in unison]:  Wait, oh yeah! [Jake grows his liver to enormous size]
Jake:  Dog liver times fifty-one!
Me-Mow:  A magic dog? Nooo!
Finn:  How you feeling, dude?
Jake:  [singing like a rockstar] Big liver, big liver, yeah!!
Me-Mow:  You've ruined me! I have to wait a whole year to retake the assassins test!
Wildberry Princess:  Aww! How 'bout I made you my royal pet?
Wildberry Princess:  Oh, dear....
Finn:  Nice defense mechanism, Wild B!
Jake:  Are you naked?
Wildberry Princess:  Oh, no, this is a medical condition. I need a hospital [groans]
Jake:  Hehe, we all need a hospital.
[Scene shifts to off the cliff: A bird flies by with Me-mow riding it. The episode ends with Me-mow glaring at Finn, Jake, and Wildberry Princess.]
