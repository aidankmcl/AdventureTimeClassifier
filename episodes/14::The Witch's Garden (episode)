Jake:  Dude... how long are we gonna follow this frog?
Finn:  I just wanna see 'im put on that crown.
Finn & Jake:  [Running towards the gate] Wooow!
Jake:  It looks cool in there!
Finn:  [Pointing to lock on gate] Too bad we don't have the key to this.
Jake:  What're you talkin' about? [Indicating his legs] I got two keys right here!
Finn:  Whoo-hoo!
Jake:  Wow! Look at this place!
Finn:  Jake. Are these donuts?
Jake:  They look like donuts.
Finn:  But maybe they're poisonous donuts! [Jake begins sniffing one of the donuts on the bush.] Yeah! Sniff it, Jake! Suck up those toxins!
Jake:  Wait a second... I don't know what poison smells like.
Witch:  Hey! [She strains towards Finn and Jake on her cane.] [Lifting her cane] Razzamafoo!
Jake:  Hey!
Finn:  What gives?!
Witch:  You ate one of my donuts!
Jake:  No, I didn't. I just sniffed it.
Witch:  RAAAAAGH!! You're lying! The stink of magic dog lips is everywhere!
Finn:  Holy slug, lady! Calm down!
Jake:  Listen, Mrs. Witch.
Witch:  I never married!
Jake:  Well, I never ate your donuts.
Witch:  You... you're eating one right now!
Jake:  [Mouth full] No, I'm not! [Noticing he is holding a donut] Whoa-hoa! Hm... That's weird... I don't even remember grabbing this. My subconscious must be hungry, huh? Huh... whatever. [Finishes donut]
Witch:  [Convulses angrily] MAGICUS NOMORICUS!
Jake:  Uh-oh. [Gets blasted]
Finn:  AAH! [The magic smoke makes him and Jake cough.] Dude, are you okay?
Jake:  Yeah... I think so. Just a little chilly. [Noticing he is in his underwear] WHOA!
Witch:  Ahahahahahehehe!
Finn:  What did she do to you?
Witch:  I stripped him of his magical powers!
Finn:  For stealing one of your billions of donuts?!
Jake:  Yeah, it's not like I killed your husband or somethin'.
Witch:  [Livid] I AM NOT MARRIED!
Finn:  The point is you overreacted.
Jake:  And what gives? [Pointing to his nipple] I used to have like eight more of these things.
Witch:  The only way I'll give back your powers is if you admit your error and say you're sorry and mean it! ...'Cause I can tell the difference.
Jake:  Well, you can forget it because you're the one who's wrong! [To Finn] ...Right?
Finn:  Total support, dude.
Witch:  [Convulsing angrily] RRRRAAAARRGH!! [Waving her cane] Go-backicus-from-whence-you-came-icus!
Finn:  Aw, now you're just makin' these up!
Witch:  [Rubbing one of the donuts] Are you alright, my... my donut pretties? Heh heh... Wait a second. YOU'RE A BAGEL! LIARS! LIARS EVERYWHERE! [The bagel becomes "stripped." Scene shifts to the Tree Fort.]
Finn:  There's gotta be a way to get your powers back! Where'd they come from, anyway? Were you born with them? Or... did you have a freak industrial accident?!
Jake:  Ha. That takes me back. Let me just... [deep voice] remember. [A memory bubble appears above his head.] I see a memory. When I was just a pupster... I'm rollin' around in a mud puddle, and I'm just... lovin's it. Oh, no! [The bubble explodes. Jake pants from exhaustion.] Whoo... Remembering is hard work.
Finn:  What happened next?!
Jake:  Oh. Um... I went into the mud, and... I guess I became a magic dog?
Finn:  Okay! Then our course is clear! We'll roll you in every mud puddle in Ooo until we find the one that'll restore your powers.
Jake:  [Lying down] That's nuts, man. You got any idea of how many mud puddles are in the land of Ooo? Four? Maybe even five?
Finn:  Jake, come on! We've always been lucky, buddy! Maybe the first mud puddle we find will be the right one!
Jake:  Nonsense... but I like it!
Finn:  [Jumping out window] Then away! Hyuh! Whoo-hoo!
Jake:  Yeah, let's do it!
Finn:  Oh, my gosh!
Jake:  I forgot that I don't have magic powers anymore. How do we search for the mud without my powers?
Finn:  We run! Run like energetic little boys! [Finn runs quickly away.]
Jake:  [To himself] This whole time, I thought running was some sort of... leg magic. [Jake begins trudging along. Before long, he gets tired.] Huh... Look at me. I'm runnin'! [Pants heavily; the camera gets ahead of him as he slows down.] Oh, no... [Thud; camera pans back to Jake.] [Out of breath] Running... is... evil...
Finn:  Come on, lazy bones!
Jake:  It's too hard!
Finn:  I guess you could ride on my backpack.
Jake:  [Straining] I can't reach. [Finn bends backwards; Jake grabs on to Finn's neck.] You good, Finn?
Finn:  [Choking] You're... strangling me... a little, is all.
Finn:  Look there! Across the River of Junk! There's an ideal mud puddle.
Jake:  I'll stretch into a boat! [Strains then farts] I'm startin' to really miss that old magic of mine.
Finn:  We can swim this river easy! [Jumps into river] Come on, Jake! [Swims across, leaving Jake behind]
Jake:  [To himself] Man, that looks exhausting.
Jake's subconscious: You're right, Jake. It is exhausting.
Jake:  [Gasp] What are you?!
Jake's subconscious:  I'm your subconscious!
Jake:  Okay, what are you doing here?
Jake's subconscious:  I'm here to tell you that what you're feeling deep down inside is true! It is way too hard to swim across the river. It's easier to wear a hat. [Handing Jake a hat] Here! Have a hat!
Jake:  [Donning the hat] Ha ha!
Jake & his subconscious:  Yeah-hea-hea-hea! Heh heh!
Jake:  Man, I'm glad I met you.
Finn:  Jake! Stop talking to yourself! Cross over already!
Jake:  Uh, I can't swim that river, dude. My subconscious says it's too hard. Check out this hat, though.
Finn:  [Growls] What's wrong with that guy? [To Jake] Then just wait for me there!
Jake:  Whatcha workin' on, Finn? [Finn continues constructing a catapult from the junk, still mumbling angrily to himself. "... have to do everything!"] Look at you! Doin' stuff! [Finn pulls down the catapult lever.] Oh, is it a chair? [Jake gets on the platform.] A chair for my butt? [Finn releases the lever, launching Jake all the way to the other side of the river and into the mud puddle.] Mud-venture!
Finn:  Did it work?!
Jake:  Oh, yeah! I can feel this workin'! In fact, you should roll in the mud with me, Finn! We can both be magic!
Finn:  YEAAAAH! [Joins Jake in the mud. They laugh and roll around in it.] This isn't working at all.
Jake:  This isn't the right mud. I was just really hopin' this was over and done.
Finn:  [Sigh] Okay... Then let's just go find another mud puddle.
Jake:  Actually... I'm feeling kinda chubby-tired. Can't we do this tomorrow?
Finn:  Agh! This is stupid! Just go back to the witch and apologize and get your powers back!
Jake:  Never! I'd rather be powerless forever then apologize! I'm lazy but prideful.
Finn:  [Angrily] YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRYING, MAN! [Knocks Jake's hat off] First, you won't run, [Stuttering] a-and now you keepand... a-and no matter what, I juyou...
Jake:  Adventuring is too much hard work for a bro without his powers.
Finn:  But you are an adventurer.
Jake:  Nah, from now on, I'm just your regular old dog. ...Ironic given my current man-baby body.
Gary:  Behold the beautiful mermaid of the river. [Finn retches.] Which one of you mortals wants to mate with [Gesturing over her body] all this? Heh heh heh...
Finn:  Oh, um... How do I say, "You're the grossest thing ever," without offending you?
Gary:  RAAAAAARGH!!
Jake:  I'll scare her off, Finn! [Barks at her]
Finn:  How do we beat power like that?!
Jake:  Finn! I've got an idea!
Finn:  What is it, buddy??
Jake:  Rub my belly! Yeah, I'm one of those kinda dogs.
Finn:  [Charging Gary] YAAAAH!
Jake:  Finn? [Gary takes him to her nest.] Finn! Come on, Finn! You gotta save yourself! I'm just a dog! Aw, man. Oh, geez... Okay. Then I'm back on the team! [Attempts to climb tree] I'll save you!
Finn:  Jake? [Giant eggs around him are beginning to hatch.]
Jake:  Don't worry! [He fails to climb the tree.] Hey, Finn... Can you help me to get up there?
Hatchlings:  Hungry! Hungry! Hungry!
Jake:  [Desperate noise] If only I had my powers back!
Witch [In Jake's memory]:  The only way I'll give back your powers is if
Jake:  I know, I know! I have to apologize to that Witch.
Witch:  [To cupcake] Oh, you're doing so well... and I hate you so much!!
Jake:  [At gate] Hey! [He's straining to get past the gate, but he's too fat.] Witch! I need my powers back! So I'm sorry! I'm so sorry I ate your donut!
Witch:  Razzamafoo.
Jake:  [Straining sounds] ...Oh. [Stops straining] So do I get my powers back?!
Witch:  Mmm... Apology denied.
Jake:  What?! Why?!
Witch:  Because you took too long. Now you have to apologize while doing a variety of humiliating things.
Jake:  No way, Jose!
Jake's subconscious:  Come on, dude. It's the only way to save Finn.
Witch:  Who is that?!
Jake:  He's my subconscious.
Witch:  Then he has to do it too.
Jake's subconscious:  Aw...
Jake:  I, Jake the dog, while slow-dancing with my subconscious, with flowers in my underwear, do humbly apologize...
Witch:  [Starts shooting with video camera] Wait, wait. Start over.
Jake:  You're recording this?!
Witch:  It's for my newsletter.
Jake:  No way. I have my dignity.
Witch:  Then guess what, cool guy? You can forget about getting your powers back... EVER!!
Jake:  [To his subconscious] Oh, no, dude! What do we do now?
Jake's subconscious:  I'm dyin', Jake.
Jake:  Wha?!
Witch:  Hm. He says he's dying. Let that be a lesson to all you cupcakes. [Trembles] Hah...
Jake:  Why are you dying, bro?
Jake's subconscious:  Because... I'm the subconscious of your old magical self. [Coughs] Goodbye, Jake...
Jake:  No! No! [Starts crying]
Witch:  So I've finally broken you.
Jake:  Yeah! [Sobs] If only... I were a humbler guy, my subconscious would be alive, and my best bud wouldn't be trapped in a mermaid's nest!
Witch:  YES! GLOAT, GLOAT, GLOAT! Alright, I think you've learned your lesson. [Kindly] I forgive you.
Jake:  [Magically stretching his arms] My powers! How can I ever thank [Swipes her magic cane away] Ha! Got your cane!
Witch:  WHAAA! OOF! [Falls over] [Jake grabs yet another donut and eats it. His subconscious, now well, gets on his back and they both flee.] But didn't you learn your lesson?!?
Jake:  NOPE!!! [He and his subconscious laugh.]
Hatchlings:  Hungry! Hungry!
Gary:  Remember to save the brain for dessert.
Jake:  Honey, I'm back! How about a big kiss? [Jake kisses her with great force, knocking Gary back into the river.] [To Hatchlings, in a cutesy voice] You guys are so cute! I could just maul you to death!
Finn:  Jake! [Hugs Jake's face] I never should have doubted you!
Jake:  Well, I'm glad you learned your lesson: that in a crunch, there's nothin' I wouldn't do for ya.
Finn:  Ahhh, so is that how you got your powers back? You apologized to the witch?
Jake:  Uh... [Sweats profusely] No way! I must have found the right... mud puddle! Yeah... I don't remember. Heh... [Blabbers lips with relief as the episode ends.]
