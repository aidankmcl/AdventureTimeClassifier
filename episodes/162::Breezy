Doctor Princess: [Examining Finn's arm] Hmm....
Finn: What is it?
Doctor Princess: It's looking droopier.
Finn: But I've been pounding pickle juice like I was preggos. For the electrolytes.
Doctor Princess: Well, switch back to water. But what I really want to know, is how are you feeling Finn?
Finn: What? Oh, I don't know. [imitates trumpet tooting], I guess I don't feel anything. Bleh. [slides off the bed]
Doctor Princess: Okay, that's what I thought. You gotta bounce back, man. You got burned by your bad dad, you lost your arm, and all the ladies say you don't talk to Flame Princess no more.
Finn: Who's sayin' that?
Doctor Princess: Finn, flowers thrive on good vibes. As your doctor, I'm ordering you to go out and have fun, okay?
Finn: You want to go with me to Crab Princess' party tonight?
Doctor Princess: Uh, what? Like... as a date?
Finn: Sure. That would be fun, right?
Doctor Princess: Finn, I don't date my patients.
Finn: It's cool. Guess I'll go make out with Crab Princess.
Doctor Princess: Okay. Tell her I said "hi".
Finn: I'm lost in the darkness, what will this bring? Autumn descends on me,Autumn
Breezy: What do I see? Oh, so beautiful. My heart it beats. Oh, so magical.
Finn: I'm lost in the darkness, what will this bring?
Finn: [Sighs]
Lumpy Space Princess: Aah! Watch it, Crab Princess!
Crab Princess: I'm sorry.
Lumpy Space Princess: You ain't my man, so why are you all up in my lumps?!
Raggedy Princess: [Grunts as she attempts to drink] Hey, Finn, could you pour this juice into my mouth?
Finn: What? Pfft! [Breezy flies past Finn's face] Aah!
Raggedy Princess: I can't reach my juice.
Finn: [Shaking off Breezy from his arm] Yo, come on bee! Geez!
Breezy: Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize
Finn: Didn't realize what? That there's a person attached to this flower?
Breezy: Uh, yes. I'm sorry. But it's only because your flower's the greatest miracle of all time. It's just doing something to me, I[tears up]
Finn: Oh, that's cool. Thanks, beezy.
Breezy: My name's Breezy.
Raggedy Princess: [muffled] Never mind, Finn. [The cup is on her mouth. She laughs and spits the cup away, then runs away laughing.]
Breezy: So uh, what are you doing here? Heh.
Finn: Ah, well, I came here to make out with Crab Princess, but I sort of lost steam on the walk over. [Breezy stares intensely at Finn's flower] I don't know what crabs are into. I'm just gonna stop trying and let my flower wilt away. Who cares?
Breezy: I'll try for you, man.
Finn: Whoa! Really?
Breezy: Yeah! I'm gonna help you, friend.
Crab Princess: Hey, Emerald Princess, you know what would blow this party up?
Emerald Princess: What?
Crab Princess: If we all got in a line and just showed off our moves.
Lumpy Space Princess: Yeah! Do it! Oh, my glob! Aah ha ha! Haa!
Crab Princess: Thanks for walking me home, Finn. I'd invite you over, but you can't breathe underwater, right?
Finn: Not usually, but can I have a kiss, please?
Crab Princess: Uh, okay...
Finn: Okay. Good night, Crab Princess.
Crab Princess: Good night, Finn! [giggles, gurgles]
Breezy: Hey, you did it!
Finn: Oh, you're still here.
Breezy: Yeah, [chuckles] just checking in... on my buddy. So, how you feelin', buddy?
Finn: Pretty grease. I made out with Crab Princess, so that's grease. But really I don't feel nothing. Maybe if I made out, I will feel something? Maybe I'll reach a "good vibe" saturation point. And then my flower will feel good, too...
Breezy: Your flower feels good, yes.
Finn: [laughs] Hey, cut it out, Breezy.
Breezy: Ha ha! I'm just messin' around. We're buddies, right?
Finn: Yeah, Breezy, I like you. You're a good wingman.
Breezy: Yeah, wingman. I'm a girl, but all right! Let's wingman you some make-outs!
Lizard Princess: [Sighs]
Finn: [Whispering]
Lizard Princess: [rattling]
Muscle Princess: [Giggles]
Jake: Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
Jake: [Chuckles]
Finn: What's up with your head?
Jake: Eh, I'm trying something new. Hey, how's it going, miss...?
Frozen Yogurt Princess: Frozen Yogurt Princess.
Jake: Whoa. You're a dead ringer for Flame Princess, with a smidge of Princess Bubblegum mixed in. [To Finn] Guess you're still hung up on both of 'em, bro.
Finn: [Flips the table in front of him angrily] I ain't hung up on nobody! Nobody. Breezy, let's get out of here.
Breezy: Okay.
Finn: She doesn't look anything like Flame Princess, does she?
Breezy: I don't know who that is.
Finn: Exactly. [Finn sits, leaning on a log.] I'm just trying to have fun. You know, doctor's orders. But I still ain't feelin' nothing. [sighs] maybe I should just let this poor flower die.
Breezy: Noooo... Listen, buddy, being a free spirit is fun and all, but you got a responsibility to that flower, just like I got a responsibility. Get thisI'm actually a virgin queen bee. I was born to lead a hive, destined for a life of obligation and ritual.
Finn: Whoa. Bummer.
Breezy: Yes. Once I drink of the royal jelly, my carefree days are done.
Finn: Dang. That sounds like raw deez. Breezy, you got to stay free... Free to make out with whatevs. [Finn jumps up]
Breezy: Yeah, maybe you're right. You know, it's too bad we're such great buddies or we could make out with each other. [chuckles]
Finn: What?
Breezy: Uh, nothing. Come on, pal! Lets run and be free. [chuckles nervously]
Breezy: Whoops! I tripped right into you [Breezy purposefully fakes an accident, bumping Finn and causing both of them to roll.] [giggles]
Breezy: That's right. Everybody's havin' fun...
Finn: Whoops!
Both: Whoa!
Bee Person: [humming]
Both: [laughing]
Bee Person: What's that?
Bee Person: Mnh-mnh! Hey, girl! Girl, I know you can hear me! [to Breezy]
Bee Person: Girl, get back to your hive! Quit hanging out with that bologna tube! It's disgusting!
Finn: Mnh-mnh. [rolls out of the water] Yo! Shut it! She's an independent lady!
Breezy: Yeah, shut it!
Bee Person: A'ight! [opens door to hive] Hey! You guys want to roast a wiener
Other Bee People: [Together] Yeah!
Bee Person: Gonna teach you to mind your b's and q's, chump! [takes out a weapon and charges towards Finn] Buzzzzz!
Finn: Uh! Run, Breezy!
Finn: Aah!
Bee Person: You're about to get waggle-danced, you chicken! [Finn punches the Bee Person.] Unh!
Finn: Ow! Ooh! [Finn falls to the ground.]
Breezy: Oh, no! Flower! I-I mean Finn! [gasps]
Breezy: [Clattering] aha! [flies back out] Don't worry, Finn! [Breezy holds up bottle] I jacked some royal jelly from their hive! [opens bottle cap]
Finn: [groans] Breezy... No!
Breezy: [Gulps the royal jelly juice] [gasps] Aaaah.
Breezy: Hey, honeybuns!
Finn: [Groans]
Bee Person: Whoa! Oh, No! She got into our secret sauce, bro! It's all over! [All bee people] Long live the queen!
Finn: [Now sitting up] Breezy?
Breezy: Yes, Finn. Can't you see? I've become a queen to save you because... I love your flower andand I think... I love you! [opening a zip] Now you can partake of my pollen crumbles and become my drone.
Finn: Um... You know, I'mI'm trying to keep it casual, B. I just don't feel the same way. I don't feel anything.
Breezy: [Now sad] But I royal jellied for you. [sniffles]
Finn: I'm lost in the darkness, Breezy.
Lumpy Space Princess: Finn. [Finn still dancing] Finn. [Shouting to Finn] I saw this already! [Finn falls down.] [Dance music stops playing.] [Lumpy Space Princess approaches Finn.] I know all about your dirty deeds. Now it's Lumpy's turn to slump those lips! Bring it in, baby.
Lumpy Space Princess: Wha? Where you going?
Finn: That's it. We made out.
Lumpy Space Princess: WhaWhat?! I didn't wait infinity for a dip in the kiddie pool! We're taking this to the deep end!
Finn: But I'm not a good swimmer.
Lumpy Space Princess: Don't be scared, Finn. Lumpy's on lifeguard duty.
Finn: [to flower on his arm] How's it going, guy? Is any of this helping?
Finn: I'm gonna forget you did that. Right in the vault.
Finn: Whoa, whoa, whoooooa!
Finn: [Dances with joy] Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
Lumpy Space Princess: [Waking up] What the lump? Oh, hey! Finn, you got your arm back!
Finn: [laughing] Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Breezy...
