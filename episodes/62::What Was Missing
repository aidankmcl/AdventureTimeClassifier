Finn: Jake? BMO?
Jake: Hey, man, what you doing?!
Finn: [Startled] Dude!
Jake: Don't worry, bro. We won't tell anyone about the private time you spend with your wad of Princess Bubblegum's hair.
Finn: [Blushing] You guys knew?
Jake: Finn, we're roommates. Which is why I'm gonna share my beloved keepsake with you.
Jake:  Babadadaa! My old baby blanket.
Door Lord: Hmmm! Hmmhmmhmmhmm!
Finn: Who are you?
Door Lord: Hmm hmm hmm hmm!
Door Lord: Hmmhmmhmm.
BMO: Noooo!
Door Lord: Hmmhmm!
Finn: Come on!
Finn: I'll get your kid back, toy!
Door Lord: Hmmhmmph!
Jake: That guy must do crazy squats.
Princess Bubblegum: Get back here, you thieving Door Lord! You butt!
Finn: Come on, Bubblegum!
Princess Bubblegum: Finn?
Finn: Marceline! Are you okay?!
Marceline: Yeah.
Finn: Don't worry. We'll get him.
Finn:  No! [Sighs] What? [Letters start to light up around the gate's frame] "This door shall yield to no command save for a song from a genuine band." What is this gripagrap?![citation needed]
Princess Bubblegum:  It's the door of the Door Lord, Finn. We used to lock them up, but they kept breaking out. 'Cause they're Door Lords.
Marceline:  [Wearing a sunhat and gloves] They broke out because you let them live.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Angered grunt]
Finn:  Hmm? The door said it will open for genuine band. Let's try and music this door open as a quintet.
Jake:  Can I be the jerk it the band? 'Cause that's an important part of a band's success. [Shrinks face] Hmph.
Marceline:  I know how to get through this door. We're gonna lay down a chill jam.
Finn:  Hey. Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Marceline:  Just keep it cool. Got that princess?
Princess Bubblegum:  Hmph. [Grabs BMO]
BMO: Ohh! [Princess Bubblegum pulls off its face] Oh, my face!
Jake:  Let's see if you hacks can keep up with my raw talent!
Finn:  It's working! Look at the door!
Marceline:  ...To bury you in the ground... and drink the blood from your... Ugh!
Marceline: [At Princess Bubblegum] Stop staring at me! Ugh, you threw me off!
Finn: Come on, everybody! Don't stop now. The door was responding to our music! I wonder what it liked or what was missing.
Jake:  Well, I know what's missing. Talent. I'm getting out of here, you hacks! Talentless hacks! [Leaves]
Marceline:  Yikes.
Finn: [Takes off his backpack] Maybe to be a genuine band we need to be nicer to each other and hang out as buds. [Pulls out a noodle cake] Let's take a noodle break. Come on, it will help!
Finn: No! Wait, don't go, too!
Marceline: I'm just gonna get stuff to cook that.
Finn:  Cook?
Princess Bubblegum: That was sweet what you said about being buds.
Finn: Mm-hmm. Thanks.
Marceline: [Returning with a hot plate] I'm back yo! Come here, baby. [BMO comes and Marceline sticks hot plate plug into BMO]
BMO:  Oh.
Princess Bubblegum: For our next attempt, I wanna be the lead.
Finn: Yeah! Sounds cool, my bud.
Jake: Hmph!
Finn: Jake, you're back!
Jake: Shut yo' face. I came back for the music.
Princess Bubblegum: BMO, execute Sound Structure Alpha. [BMO begins to play a song] Marceline, begin playing triplet quavers in mixolydian mode.
Marceline:  Alright, fine. [Begins to play her Ax bass] Wait, what's a quaver?
Princess Bubblegum: Now, Finn, vibrate your uvula by dampening and undampening your larynx.
Finn: Wha?
Princes Bubblegum: [Rubbing her neck, vibrating her voice] Go like this, silly.
Finn:  Oh. [Does it] Whaaaa...
Princess Bubblegum:  Okay, okay. Jake, are you gonna join in?
Princess Bubblegum:  Everyone, just stick to my blueprints. [Gasps] [BMO catches fire]
BMO: Oohh...
Finn: [Sighs] One more time?
Princess Bubblegum: I may have, um... miscalculated.
Marceline: Ha! Looks like you aren't as perfect as you thought. Guess you can't judge me anymore.
Princess Bubblegum: I never said you had to be perfect!
Finn: Alright, time out, guys.
Finn: Princess! Princess, wait!
Marceline: [Hisses] Whatever, [Eyes start to water] Ugh! I'm outta here, too! [Leaves]
Finn: Marceline?
Jake: [Cries] You've all forgotten 'bout the music! I quit the band! [Runs away backwards] I'm just pretending!
Finn: Jake! Everybody! We can beat the Door Lord! ...Together.
Door Lord: [Spits out sandwich] Hmm? Hmmhmmhmm!
Finn: It's over, Door Lord.
Jake: So hand over our stuff.
Door Lord: Hmmhmmhmmhmm. Hmmhmmhmm hmmhmmhmmhmm hmmhmm hmmhmmhmmhmm. Hmm!
Finn: What's he trying to say?
Marceline: I totally get it. He may have stolen our treasures...
Princess Bubblegum: ...But by doing so, he showed us...
Jake: ...That the real treasure is friendship.
Door Lord: [Happy] Mmmhmmhmm! Mmmhmm hmmhmmhmm.
Door Lord: Hmm...
Jake: Okay, here's that lock of Bubblegum's hair you love so much.
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, you.
Finn: [Sighs] Ah, yeesh.
Jake: And here's Jakey's blankey. [Puts it on his face] Here's your controller, BMO.
BMO: [Happily twirls it] Yippie ki-yi-yay!
Jake: Marceline, here's your rock shirt.
Marceline: Hey, that's not...
Princess Bubblegum: [Rushes towards it] It's mine! That's mine.
Marceline: You... kept the shirt I gave you?
Princess Bubblegum: Yeah. It, uh, means a lot to me.
Marceline: But you never wore it.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Puts it on] Dude, I wear it all the time... as pajamas.
Finn:  Wait, if that's Bubblegum's shirt, what are you missing, Marceline?
Finn: Wait a second, wait a second! You don't have a thing! You just wanted to hang out with us!
Marceline: No, I didn't!
Finn: No way, you're caught! I figured you out! [Laughs]
Marceline: [Playfully] I'll kill you!
