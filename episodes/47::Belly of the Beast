Finn:  [tiredly] What's shakin'?
Jake:  I-I don't know. I think I'm still asleep
Finn:  What if I'm still asleep?
Jake:  Then we're sharin' the same dream, dude. [points] Look out your window!
Finn:  Aah! Dream monster!
Finn:  Quick, let's go enjoy this dream before we wake up!
Finn & Jake:  [holding hands and dancing in a circle]  Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream...
Jake:  Whoaaaaa!
Finn:  ... [continues singing] Dreamy, dream, dream...
Jake:  [stretches back to Finn] Hey, man, I don't think this is a dream.
Finn:  Hmm? [looks up at monster]
Finn:  Oh, well, then it's time to get real. [takes out Root Sword]
Voice:  Help! Somebody help! Help! Help me! Help me!
Finn:  The monster ate somebody! We have to go inside its guts!
Jake:  [digusted] Ughhhh, monster guts.
Jake:  [stepping in something squishy] Bleh.
Voice:  Help! Somebody help!
Finn:  Hyup! [jumps toward voice and slides down a wet slope]
Jake:  [sliding behind him] Eeeeeeee!
Jake:  Ohhhhh. It's gross!
Finn:  [laughs]
Bear:  Help!
Finn:  [running to bear] C'mon!
Bear:  Help! Help me... hang these streamers! [takes out streamers]
Finn & Jake:  What?!
Bear:  It's not a party without streamers!  Doot-doot-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo 
Finn:  Dude, this isn't a party! We gotta get you outta here!
Finn:  Jake, help me!
Bear:  It's starting! [running to fireworks] Hehehehehehe!
Finn:  These crazy bears don't know they're in danger!
Jake:  Well... we should go.
Finn:  Jake, wait. We have to help them.
Jake:  They're partying! They're fine.
Finn:  [sighs] Okay, Jake, what happens when you eat food?
Jake:  Well, it goes into your stomach...
Finn:  Yeah...?
Jake:  ...and then it stays there for a bit, and then it turns into[gasps] They're all gonna turn into... the stuff!
Finn:  [walks up to a bear] [talking over loud music] Hey, excuse me! Excuse me! I don't know how you don't know this, but y'all are partyin' in a monster's stomach!
Bear:  Thanks! I love dancing!
Finn:  No! [using hand signals] Y'ALL... are PARTYIN'... in a MONSTER'S... STOMACH!
Bear:  [to another bear] I THINK HE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE THE BATHROOM IS!
Other bear:  [points] IT'S OVER THERE!
Someone off screen:  Hey...
Cubby:  I'm Cubby.
Finn:  Hi, Cubby.
Jake:  What's goin' on?
Cubby:  I heard what you said... about this being a monster's belly? I've been telling everyone that for three days!
Finn:  Why won't they listen?
Cubby:  'Cause I'm just a kid!
Older bear:  Cubby! Are you bothering these guys with your fantasy stories?
Cubby:  No! I wasn't! I swear! I'm dancing, see? SEE?! [dances faster]
Older bear:  Hmm... [dances away]
Finn:  Cubby, is there anything we can do to help?
Cubby:  You could talk to Party Pat.
Finn:  Party Pat?
Cubby:  He's our chief. If you can convince him to leave, all will follow.
Finn:  Can you take us to him?
Cubby:  Sure. He sleeps on the monster's heart. It's like a blood waterbed.
Cubby:  This is as far as I go. Party Pat is right around this corner. Bye, you guys!
Finn:  Bye, Cubby!
Jake:  Bye!
Finn:  Uhh... we're lookin' for Party Pat?
Finn:  Oh, uh... [walks up to him] Well, listen. I know you don't know us, sir, but we need to talk.
Party Pat:  [snaps his fingers and approaches them]
Finn:  It's pretty important, actually
Party Pat:  [placing his finger over Finn's mouth] Shhh-sh-sh-sh-shhhh. You know who I am?
Finn:  You're Party Pat?
Party Pat:  [shakes his head] I'm the chief.
Finn:  Riiiight... right.
Jake:  You're the chief.
Party Pat:  [places his finger over both their mouths] Shhhh... before you talk to the chief, you must party with the chief.
Finn:  But!
Party Pat:  It is the only way.
Jake:  Dude, we've been partyin' for hours.
Finn:  [panting] Yeah, he keeps drinking those honey-flavored energy drinks.
Finn:  How's your nausea?
Jake:  Full-blown.
Finn:  Hang in there, pal. [walks over to Party Pat] Hey, Party Pat. You're the chief, and I totes respect that... but what we have to tell you is really important. And you said if we partied, we could talk.
Party Pat:  But you haven't been partying.
Finn:  What?!
Party Pat:  You move to music, but that's not dancing. You chew pancakes, but you're not tasting. To truly party, one must leave behind the problems that are troubling [puts hands on forehead] and open one's [moves hands away, revealing a third eye] mind eye. [beat] I'm just kiddin'. You guys are party animals. [points to third eye] This is just a sticker! [peels it off] You can stay in our cave as long as you want.
Finn:  That's what I've been trying to tell you, man! This isn't a cavey'all are partyin' in a monster's BELLY!
Party Pat:  [looks around] Oh, yeah. That makes sense. It's definitely the weirdest cave I've ever seen. Heh heh.
Finn:  So... you'll tell everyone to leave?
Party Pat:  Nah, we love it here.
Finn:  But you're all gonna die if you stay!
Party Pat:  [sighs] [picks up a microphone] Attention. Attention, everybody. Can I have your attention, please? [bears stop dancing] So... apparently we're not in a cave.
Party Pat:  We're in a... MONSTER'S BELLY!
Party Pat:  [shrugs, drops the microphone, and backs away]
Jake:  It's kinda peaceful.
Monster:  [sighs]
Finn:  All those bears... are gonna turn into the stuff.
Jake:  [puts his finger over Finn's mouth] Shh. Seriously? The only foreseeable threat might be all these trees being swallowed, but they're not hurtin' nothin'.
Finn:  Yeah, good thing he isn't swallowing some deadly volcano lava. That would kill them for sure.
Finn & Jake:  Whoaa.
Finn:  The monster is headed toward that volcano!
Monster:  Uh-huh.
Finn:  We gotta warn the bears!
Finn:  If we bum everyone out, maybe they'll listen to us.
Jake:  Oh, okay.
Finn:  Just follow my lead.
Finn:  You bears gotta get outta here or you're all gonna be melted by lava!
Finn:  Party Pat, do you know of another exit?
Party Pat:  Well, there's the dark and mysterious mine, but nobody uses it anymore.
Finn:  [to Jake] He must be talkin' about the butt intestines! C'mon, Jake, we gotta get outta here!
Jake:  [disgusted] Ehhhhh.
Finn:  One more bandage.
Finn:  Huzzah! The party bears are safe, Party Pat. Y'all can party out here now.
Party Pat:  No. To survive, my people need a phat party club to grind in. That monster's gut was totally excellent.
Jake:  You're sick, Party Pat. I'm gonna go watch TV. [walks off]
Finn:  Hmmm. [looks at monster]
Monster:  [rubbing his tongue] Ohh...
Finn:  Pat, he's not gonna let you back in his mouth. You scorched it all up with fireworks! Unless... Party Pat! [whispers in Party Pat's ear] Party... pancakes.
Party Pat:  [gasps] [walks to monster] Hear me, monster. My people and I wish to party inside you once more. Prithee take us upon thine gut and we shall party no more with fireworks but instead [takes out a laser] with gentle lasers!
Finn:  Hey, Jake. [runs after Jake] Wait up!
