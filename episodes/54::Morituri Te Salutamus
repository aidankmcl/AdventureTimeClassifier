Finn:  Jake, why didn't you stick to the plan?
Jake:  Psshh. Hey, you wanna bump baby lumps?
Finn:  Sick. No. Just try to follow the plans, okay?
Jake:  Yeah.
Finn:  Come on out, cuties. It's safe now.
Jake:  Now get out of here. [The creatures scamper.]
Finn:  Hey, you hear something? Up there. [He and Jake scale the rocks to the top. From there, they can see an arena of unknown sorts.] It's a fat, fat warrior beat. It's all... [makes sound of swords clashing] [robotic voice] It calls me forth. [makes sound of swords clashing]
Jake:  Eh, it's probably just puberty calling.
Fight King:  Fighters! Fighters! [He rings a stone bell with his large golden sword.] Seek you glory from the Fight King?
Finn:  Mmmm... Maybe.
Fight King:  Then step forth beyond the Moonlight seal to bathe in blood and glory forever.
Finn:  Nah. This is a trap.
Jake:  Ka-psshh.  [Finn and Jake turn and leave.] We snuffed out that trap like champs! Trying to get us up in that cursed arena.
Finn:  Then I'd bet the exits would all magically seal behind us.
Jake:  We'd probably have to fight Gladiator Ghosts.
Finn:  Yeah. That sounds... so dumb...[chuckles] and FLIPPING AWESOME!
Jake:  We're back!
Fight King:  Fools! All exits are sealed! [The doorway seals up behind them. There is now only a solid wall.] Now you must fight my Gladiator Ghosts!
Finn:  Yeah. Okay.
Finn:  [chuckles] I'mma beat you with your own thing. Give it up! [Finn slaps Hyperion's hand] Hah-hah! [Hyperion punches Finn in the face.] Ooomph!
Primo:  Hyperion, I'm sorry!
Primo:  Hyperion, my love!
Hyperion:  I'll kill you for breaking your promise!
Finn:  Yeah. Ah-ha-ha-ha.
Fight King:  Good... Take these branches of palm.
Finn:  Yeah.
Jake:  That prize kinda stinks. Let's go, Finn. My thighs hurt.  [Jake looks down at his currently detailed legs and begins rubbing his thighs.]
Finn:  Aw, man. Okay, it was fun. I'm keeping the branch. [Finn and Jake make to leave.]
Fight King:  Where do you think you're going? [The Fight King swirls his huge sword around in circular twists. Two pairs of hands emerge from the ground and drag Finn and Jake down into the ground.] You must earn thy freedom by defeating each of my ghosts! When you are ready, speak the Fight King's name, and I shall raise you for... battle.
Finn:  Hmm. Okay, I have a plan. We'll do what the Fight King says, and defeat his ghosts to earn our freedom. [pauses] You're gonna follow my plan, right?
Jake:  Mmm-hmm. But, hey, if you replace me with a dummy, I could stay down here and dig for lava. Then I'd forge a molten hula-hoop.
Finn:  That's an entirely different plan... than my plan. What's the hula-hoop for?
Jake: Morale, dude, This tomb will be as fun... [singing]  As a tropical island, as a tropical island, as a tropical island, as a tropical island. 
Jake:  Check it out, dude. [Jake fashions a dummy of his head out of the dirt.] Ba-duh-buh-da. It's a dirt dummy Jake. Just like in the plan.
Finn:  [Finn sighs and picks up the dummy.] We're ready... I guess, Fight King.
Fight King:  Gladitoria continues for you, human, and, er... dog?
Finn:  Yup. This is dog.
Fight King:  Arise, Priscus, Verus!
Verus:  [sobbing] Forgive me, Priscus! [He picks up the dummy and then vanishes.]
Fight King:  Pity. The dog falls.
Priscus:  Et tu, Verus?
Finn:  Heh.
Fight King:  The combat endeth. Now come closer, champion.
Jake:  Dig-dig-dig-dig-dig-dig-dig. Two gongs? Something crazy's going on up there. [He stretches up to the surface and pulls the dirt dummy under.] It's me, Jake. Been here the whole time. Huh?
Fight King:  Come closer, my champion. You have proven worthy of my favor.
Finn:  Hah. Word.
Jake:  Oh, this is bad.
Fight King:  Accept your prize. [He hands Finn another palm branch. Finn eats it. Afterwards, Finn starts behaving strangely, striking the ground with both fists. Jake walks up to him.]
Jake:  Finn?
Fight King:  Ah... The dog lives.
Jake:  Yeah. I lives. Finn, come with me, man. [Finn suddenly turns around and throws a punch at Jake. Jake stretches back.] Whoa! Dude?
Finn:  Sorry, man. But you crossed my kill zone.
Fight King:  Fighters, rest now. [The Fight King raises his sword, and once again, Finn and Jake are dragged down into the ground. Finn starts acting like he's fighting again.]
Jake:  So, how's your side of the plan going?
Finn:  Plan? What plan?
Jake:  To escape. I dig and stuff, and you fight to win, 'member?
Finn:  Yeah. I fight. To hear bones breaking and meat tearing.
Jake:  Ghosts don't got meat.
Finn:  I fight... to FIGHT! [Starts making a dummy from dirt]
Jake:  [inner thoughts] Hmm... Finn's acting weird. Probably due to a decrease in morale. Gotta get him that lava hula-hoop.
Finn:  We're ready for our next fight, Fight King.
Jake:  Gotta liven up this unhallowed ground.... for Finn. [Jake starts singing again. As he does so, he shapes his arms into a round moon shape, and then morphs his hands into a pair of hula dancers.]  On a tropical island, underneath a molten lava moon. Hanging with the hula dancers, asking questions 'cause they got all the answers... 
Finn:  Habet! Habet! Habet! Heh-heh-heh. [He knocks over Achillea, slays Tetraides and then Amazonia, and blocks Triumphus' attack. Achillea, the gladiator whom Finn has knocked to the ground, burst into tears.]
Achillea:  Amazonia, I'm sorry! [She knocks down the dummy with her fist.]
Finn:  This next take-down is for you, my king! Rahhh... [gets punched by Triumphus] Heh-heh-heh.
Triumphus:  I need your forgiveness... [Finn knocks his head off. Triumphus vanishes. The scene cuts back to Jake.]
Jake:   Puttin' on lotion, sittin' by the ocean, rubbin' it on my body, rubbing it on my body... 
Rutuba:  Non pugnent, Flamma! [He puts all four of is blades against Finn's dual swords, but Finn shatters them.]
Finn:  Eludere!
Rutuba:  Cum missione, my friend! [Finn slays Rutuba, who vanishes.]
Finn:  Hoc habet! Whaaa! [He flings one of the swords.]
Amazonia:  Achillea...
Finn:  I have defeated every gladiator.
Fight King:  No, for there is one more opponent.
Finn:  Who?
Fight King:  Your dear companion! [Fight King raises his sword and brings the dummy Jake before Finn.]
Finn:  [demented laugh] [Sticks his sword into the dummy]
Jake:   Get me out of this caa-a-ve, 'cause it's nothing but a gladiator graa-a-ve. And if I stick to the plaa-a-n, I think I'll turn into a lava maa-a-n. I think I'll turn into a lava man!  [He suddenly notices Finn stomping and chomping on the dummy. He gasps. Finn turns at the sound.]
Fight King:  Why do you stop?
Finn:  Fight King, this Jake was a farce. Let me face the real Jake!
Fight King:  Then this is round two, my vassal! Take his head for me!
Finn:  Yes, my king. [Finn grabs the blade and starts toward Jake.]
Jake:  What about the plan?
Finn:  This is the plan, Jake! Raah! [swings the blade]
Jake:  You're gonna kill me?
Finn:  [Jake starts stretching to avoid Finn's attacks.] That's right! Everything has been building to this! The final battle! Brother against brother! TO THE DEATH!
Jake:  No!
Fight King:  Yes...
Fight King:  Yes...
Finn:  [swings his sword ineffectively at Jake's head.] Fight King!!! I can't do it. [drops blade] I can't kill him, Fight King. I can't kill my best friend.
Jake:  Finn?
Finn:  Not without a BIGGER SWORD!
Fight King:  Yes... FINISH HIM!!!
Jake:  No!
Fight King:  Aaarghh... [The Fight king suddenly shrivels up into a fragile shell of dust as the curse dies. The sky clears up, and the entrance to the arena reappears as well.]
Finn:  Wink. [fist pounds Jake]
Jake:  What? [lets go of Finn and returns to his original shape.] Dude, did you...? Was that all fake? Did you act all that out? Was that part of your plan?
Finn:  Mmm-hmm. [burps]
Jake:  So you planned to get all cozy with the Fight King and almost kill me from the get-go?
Finn:  Pretty much.
Jake:  Why didn't you say so?
Finn:  Because you always bungle my plans. But, if you had bungled this one... [deep voice] I might have, for real, chopped your head off.
Jake:  That's some funky junk, brother.
Finn:  Hey, Jake, you notice how all these ghosts are walking in pairs?
Jake:  Oh, yeah. I bet they're like us. Best bros who got trapped in that arena.
Finn:  But now they're free!
