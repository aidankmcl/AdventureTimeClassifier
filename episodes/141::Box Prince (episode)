Finn: Aw, yes. Storm has passed! Jake! [runs toward Jake] Jake...
Jake: Nachos?
Finn: Nachos? I love nachos... [eats nachos] I love nachos even more when looking out of the window! [runs back to the window]
Finn: Hmmm, does that box have a face on it? A face... I gotta make sure.
Finn: [In a loud, fast tone] There's a box outside with a face on it! It might be the boxman, it's all soggy and dirty. Want to check it out?
Jake: Naaaaa... chos.
Finn: [Hands nachos to Jake] I'm gonna check it out.
Jake: Yeah, whatever.
Finn: Hmmm, where'd your face go? [starts examining it more closely]
Finn: Whoa! Okay... shhh... are you lost, little cardboard dude?
Finn: Jake! There seems to be a lost cat on the ground in a box!
Jake: Yeah that's great, get it out of here!
Finn: Hm, gettin' no help from him I guess. Do you know where your home is?
Finn: Okay, I'll follow you!
Finn: Whoa, is this your kingdom? It's wonderful!
Finn: That must be your prince.
Cat: [Shakes, with a sad expression.]
Finn: Huh?
Finn: Huh... a prince wouldn't steal from his subjects. [The cat licks Finn's hand] Awww!
Cat: [Moves its paws back and forth]
Finn: Switched? [gasps] Of course! You must be the real prince, and that thief took your place! Is that right, little prince?
Cat: [Rolls over and meows continuously.]
Finn: [sighs] Don't worry, your majesty. I'll help you reclaim your kingdom. [Rubs the cat's head]
BMO: [Stops the game] Why do you hate cats, Jake?
Jake: Move your face, you're messing up the game. Anyway, I don't wanna talk about it, it's personal. Cats know what they did...
BMO: Is Jake okay?
Jake: Eugh... no! I'm pretty dang far from okay! There's a little shard of Tortilla chip caught between my teeth. [tries to use his tongue to get it out]
Finn: First, we have to expose the traitor's deception. Ah-hah! That's a counterfeit crown, from the liar's own box flesh. Hmm... it looks like your crown was torn off by some... [Places hand on torn area]
Box Prince: [Slaps Finn's hand away] Mew.
Finn: Your crown was lost, you say?
Box Prince: [Walks towards some plants, and starts circling one of them.]
Finn: During a storm? The same storm that sent you hurling through the woods? Until you were delivered into my door step? Right... so it's definitely in the woods somewhere. All we have to do is find your crown to prove to your people that you're the real prince.
Finn: [sniffs] Um... I'm gonna wait over by the gate, your highness.
BMO: [Interrupting the game] Get big, and the chip will fall out of your teeth!
Jake: You think I can stretch out of everything? You're so naive. To live life, you need problems.
BMO: That's stupid!
Jake: If you get everything you want the minute you want it, then what's the point of livin'?
Finn: Okay, so let's retrace your steps. Do you remember which path you took? ... Prince?
Finn: Whoa, you found it already! Good work, team. [rubs the prince's belly, which causes him to scratch and bite his arm]
Finn: Ow, quit that! [shakes him off of his arm] Come on, you're a prince. [takes out the crown] Come, your majesty. It's time...
Finn: [Places box to use as a pedestal] People of the Box Kingdom, I have found... [pulls out crown and places it on the Box Prince] your true prince! [points to fake prince] J'accuse!
Finn: What? They... they don't believe us. The rain made your complexion look all hobo-like. They're not looking past the surface grunk.
Finn: Oh no, he's challenging you to a joust! I better find you a lance.
BMO: Did it come out?
Jake: You forgot the most important part, my impatient little friend. A thorough rinsing! [Puts water in mouth and starts rinsing]
BMO: Well?
Jake: [Spits out water] Bleh, nothing. [shakes head] I need, like, a toothpick, or something.
BMO: I told you to buy floss.
Jake: Floss is for losers. [walks out of the bathroom, and to his cards on the table]
Jake: Oh, one of these will do nicely.
BMO: You'll put cards in your mouth?!
Jake: Just the edge, kid, then I'll work it like a pro. Now, to find the card that best suits my devil-may-care personality.
Finn: Trial by combat shall prove which prince's true!
Finn: The joust's gone nuts!
Jake: Hey, BMO! Ta-da!
BMO: [gasps] You did it, Jake! Congratulations! How did you get the piece of tortilla chip out of your teeth?
Jake: Oh, I didn't. It's still there. [reveals teeth] It'll be like a constant reminder of what life's all about.
BMO: ... This is unsatisfying!
Jake: ZIP IT!
Finn: [Sprays water on one of the princes.] Bad! Bad princes!
Finn: Which is which...?
Box Prince: [Licks Finn's leg.]
Finn: Awwww! [Picks up Box Prince] This is the one! This is your prince!
Box Prince #2: [Licks Finn's leg.]
Finn: [Picks up the other Box Prince] Or maybe this is the one!
Finn: Hmmm, is this... is this even a kingdom?
Finn: Haha! Hey! Ow, you guys... aw, come on!
