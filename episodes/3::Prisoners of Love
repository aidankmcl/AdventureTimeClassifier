Finn:  Oh, no, our sled's broken! Hey, let's build one out of snow! [Starts to gather snow]
Finn:  What are you doing, Jake?
Jake:  Sleds are for suckers. Just ride on my gut.
Finn:  Okay! [Jumps onto his gut and they slide down a hill]
Jake:  Switch!
Finn:  [Frozen] Switch back! Switch back! [Jake grows and they switch again as they slide through a horde of penguins]
Finn:  Penguins!
Finn:  Ha Ha!
Jake:  I'm a flying dog! [They fist tap in midair]
Ice King:  What?! [Approaches the crater] Who dares enter the Ice Kingdom?!
Finn:  Aww, Ice King's here.
Ice King:  You know why I'm here? Do you know what "Ice King" means?!
Jake:  Yeah, I know what "Ice King" means: A big nerd!
Finn:  Oh ho oh! Holy cow!
Ice King:  It means I'm King of Ice! This is my domain! And you are violating Ice World law--trespassing!
Jake:  Come on, brother! We're just trying to beat the heat.
Finn:  Yeah! There's a big sleeping lava man in our front yard, and he is SOOOOOOOOOOOO hot!
Jake:  Mmm-hmm!
Finn:  Wait, wait, no, I take it back. I mean, not like "sexy" hot.
Jake:  No, no, you do mean "sexy" hot.
Finn:  No, I mean--
Ice King:  [Annoyed] I don't care! This is my kingdom. You guys can't just scoot about on my land willy-nilly. I've got rules here.
Finn:  [Sighs] Why don't you just try being cool.
Ice King:  [Flips out] What?! I am the king! I am the king of c-cool c-co ca... That's it! Rise, monsters of snow, and go beat up Finn and Jake! [Uses magic to bring out snow monsters]
Jake:  Uh oh.
Finn:  [Laughs]
Ice King:  [Angry] Ooh, you guys are gonna get it.
Finn:  Heh heh, yeah.
Jake:  Yeah, right, sure.
Ice King:  [Groans] I need a magic back. [Cracks his back and pulls out a plastic sandwich bag] Trail mix. [Begins to pick around in it] Ick...ooh, yogurt chip. [Eats yogurt chip and puts the bag away] Tuck, tuck. [Begins to push the wheelbarrow again] Aww man.
Ice King:  I'm back home! Hello, ladies!
Ice King:  Now, now. I've brought you a baby and a puppy. [Tosses Finn and Jake into the room, where they smash against the wall and are freed from the ice]
Wildberry Princess:  Finn! Are you okay?
Finn:  Huh, Wildberry Princess? Hot Dog Princess? W-what's goin' on?
Slime Princess:  We're all prisoners, Finn.
Finn:  Ice King!
Ice King:  What?
Finn:  Why are you keeping these girls prisoners, jerk?
Ice King:  You don't understand! I collect princesses because I want to marry one.
Jake:  Well, why'd you capture six of them if you just want to marry one?
Ice King:  I'm collecting them all first to be sure I make the right choice. You're both too young to understand, but marriage is a serious thing and lasts forever. You can't just rush into it, you know?
Finn:  Ice King, don't do this. Just let the girls go. They don't want to be here.
Ice King:  Of course they do! I would have killed them already if they didn't want to be here. Right ladies? [Shoots ice lighting from his fingers] Zzhp Zzhp.
Princesses:  Mm-hm.
Finn:  [Sighs] Don't worry, princesses. I pledge that Jake and I will protect each and everyone of you and furthermore I see all of you happily married to whatever sweet thing y'all want to be married to!
Slime Princess:  Yay!
Ice King:  [Grumbles]
Finn:  Rad! All I need is something to spear the Ice King with. [Begins to search through his backpack] Binoculars... toothbrush... quilt... [Worried tone] sweater... trail mix... my flute! [Pulls out a broken, bandaged flute and plays it]
Finn:  My flute!
Jake:  Aw, nuts, dude! You broke it when we tried picking the lock to that sad ogre's heart!
Finn:  Darn it!
Ice King: Nice try, boy! Princesses, did you see? Did you see Finn fail?
Jake:  Don't worry, Finn. I'll get us out of here with Key Hand! Hah-hah! [Uses Key Hand]
Ice King:  Oh, no you won't! [Freezes Jake from the neck down]
Finn:  Jake!
Ice King:  Eat it.
Jake:  [Frozen] I... I'm okay.
Finn:  Ice King! You better either set us free or come in here and fight me 'cause otherwise I'm gonna flip out!!!
Ice King:  Oh, are you trying to hit me? Well, excuse me because I have to go potty in the bathroom. [Goes to the bathroom]
Finn:  ICE KING!!!...
Jake:  Finn!
Finn:  Huh? Jake, you alright?
Jake:  I'm fine, buddy. Calm down and tend to the princesses.
Finn:  Oh my gosh. I'm sorry, princesses. Slime Princess, are you alright?
Slime Princess:  He's held us here for weeks, questioning us about our favorite sports and quirky behavior. I've tried to tell him as little as possible.
Finn:  I understand. And, Lumpy Space Princess, how do you fair?
Lumpy Space Princess:  I'm bored, and I'm not having any fun.
Ice King:  [Returning] What? Not having any fun? But last night I read you the story of "Baby Whatsit and the Bottle Prince."
Lumpy Space Princess:  That wasn't fun. That was lame.
Ice King:  Other princesses, do you feel the same way?
Ice King:  Well, here, watch. I'll show you. We'll have some fun. Fun's my middle name.
Ice King:  Here, now, Wildberry Princess. I need you to play this. [Puts the piano by the cell]
Wildberry Princess:  I don't know how.
Ice King:  Well, come here, I'll teach you. Put your hand through the bars, atta princess, and uh... [Guides Wildberry Princess' hand to play the tune]
Wildberry Princess:  I don't think I can.
Ice King:  Just play it like I showed you.
Finn:  Leave her alone, Ice King!
Ice King:  PLAY IT OR I'LL SQUISH YOU INTO JUICE!!!
Wildberry Princess:  Oh dear! [Plays the tune]
Ice King:  Yeah, keep playing it. Now everyone pick up an instrument and play it. Oh, this is going to be so much fun!
Jake:  What are you thinking, Finn?
Finn:  I've almost devised a plan. I'm gonna let him drum till' I've finalized the details in my mind.
Ice King:  Oh, that was fun!
Finn:  Ah! It was fun! Hey, you should get some more fun stuff.
Ice King:  You're right! Good idea, Finn.
Finn:  "Good idea," indeed.
Ice King:  I hope they think I'm fun. [He leaves]
Finn:  Alright. I've got a plan on how to get out of here. First everyone needs to be dancing and laughing and saying fun stuff like "Whoopee"! Okay, when the Ice King comes back, everyone play it up, like we want him to come inside the jail and party with us and when he steps inside, I'm gonna beat the tar out of him with these... [Shows his fists] ...while you all take care of Jake. Everyone on board with this?
Jake:  Sweet plan, dude!
Lumpy Space Princess:  I think by everyone saying "whoopee" the plan won't work cause he'll know we're faking it.
Finn:  Good point, Lumpy Space Princess.
Lumpy Space Princess:  I'm gonna say something fun like "Oh yeah, I'm having a fun time! Oh my gosh, havin' the best time I've ever had in my entire life!"
Ice King:  Make way for the fun tray! Whoa, what's happening?
Ice King:  What is this?
Finn:  We're having fun! Whoopee!
Ice King:  Because I left the room?
Jake:  Because they like it here. Because they like you. Because you're a really fun guy!
Ice King:  I don't get this.
Finn:  [whispering] He's not buying it. Dance harder.
Lumpy Space Princess:  Come on in here and party.
Finn:  Wanna dance with us, Ice King? Come on!
Ice King:  Me? You want to dance with me?
Lumpy Space Princess:  Oh yeah! Whoo! Woohoo!
Ice King:  [Drops the board game] Wow! [Opens cell door and walks in] Yes! Yes! Whoopee!
Ice King:  Wait, no! [Shoots ice lighting at Emerald Princess, but she avoids it] Don't leave! I'll kill you all! [Finn punches him and Ice King tries to push him away] Why are you doing this? Everyone was finally warming up to me.
Finn:  No! That is not the case! You're nuts, man! And I don't know how to help you! Probably because I'm just a simple dude. So maybe you should talk to someone with more life experience, like Jake!
Jake:  Whoa, whoa, whoa, Finn, what are you doing? Don't dump the Ice King on me!
Finn:  But you gotta get it in you're head, man! Putting princesses in jail is wrong!
Ice King:  Bah! Finn, you just ruined my chances with 5 or 6 potential wives! For that you will... [Finn punches him in the beard] Ohh! Oh, my beard. [Finn roundhouse kicks him into a wall where his crown falls off and he loses consciousness]
Ice King:  Why do people not like me? Is it because I'm a magic user or is my beard too shaggy? [Sighs] I try so hard to be a good husband for girls. What's wrong with me?
Comic Owl:  Hoo. You're a sociopath.
Ice King:  Who are you? [Laughs] I know. You're probably a--a big nerd! Why don't you try being cool like me? [Flies away laughing when he regains consciousness and is being tickled by penguins] Star dust is so ticklish! [Laughs until he opens his eyes] What happened? Princesses? Ohhh...
Slime Princess:  Thank you, Finn.
Finn:  [Picks her up] You're welcome, Slime Princess!
Slime Princess:  And remember when you vowed to marry us to the thing of our choosing?
Finn:  Yeah...
Slime Princess:  Well, I'd like to marry you.
Everyone else:  Ooooh!
Finn:  [Awkwardly] Oh, heh heh, well how 'bout that...[whispers] Jake, help me!
Jake:  Oh, eh... Slime Princess, you shouldn't marry Finn. He pees his pants constantly. All the time.
Princesses:  Ewww!
Slime Princess:  Oh, gross! Put me down! Put me down!!!
Finn:  Heh heh, I'm sorry. Jake! [Angrily grunts]
