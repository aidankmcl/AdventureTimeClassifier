BMO:  Hello?
Finn:  BMO?
Jake:  BMO?
Finn:  BMO, are you okay?
Jake:  What did you do?
BMO:  It wasn't me. I didn't do noth- do noth- do nothing. [BMO repeats 'do noth-' because of his system glitching.]
Finn:  Come on BMO. We got to get you to the hospital or whatevs.
BMO:  No, no. I am fine. Really. [BMO's screen glitches out and BMO yells in pain. He emits smoke and stops glitching.] Oh, yes. Okay. Please take me to get fixed. I need- need- need- need to get new core system drivers installed. We can get them at the MO Factory in the Bad Lands, where I was born.
Finn: The MO Factory?
BMO:  Yeah. I am programmed with emergency instructions to get there. Come on! There's no- no- no- no- no time to lo- lo- lo- lo- lose.
BMO: Okay. Now straight down this place. Okay, now take a right- right- right- right- left up here. The instructions also say that damaged MOs get a full memory-wipe before repairs. Don't let on what happened... or all the years we've been spent together will vanish like tears in the oven!
Finn: Tears in the oven? [gloomy sounds] But memories are real, real cruc'[ial]!
BMO:  Yeah, no fooling. Oh wait, there's more! It says here only MOs are allowed in the factory. Wait what? Oh, that's just great.
Jake:  Hey, hey. Don't worry buddy. We're Finn and Jake, remember? Or should I say... [Jake transforms into a MO.] Finn and JMO!
BMO:  [laughs] Wow!
Finn:  Hey BMO, check this out, too! [Finn puts his backpack on BMO's arms. He pulls his arms into his sleeves and pulls his shirt up over his head and over BMO's legs, making it seem like Finn has BMO for a head.] Meet FMO.
BMO: Finn, you're dumb- you're dumb- you're dumb- you're da man! This is gonna be a snap!
Jake:  Hello, there.
DMO:  Greetings, and welcome to MO Co. I'm DMO. Please state your business.
Jake:  Hey there, DMO. I am JMO.
Finn:  And I'm FMO!
DMO:  Greetings, JMO. FMO, you look ridiculous. Are you damaged? Are you in need of repair?
Finn:  Yes, absolutely. Thanks, DMO. I busted my core system drivers, and now I need new ones.
DMO:  Fantastic. Okay. Please get ready for your total personality wipe.
Finn:  Oh, right, right. Uh, right. I mean, no. I'm just here for the... nostalgic purposes.
DMO:  Ah, yes. 47.3% of MOs eventually return to the factory for assorted sentimental biz. Please step 100% on the ultra-tram for your complimentary tour.
DMO:  Greetings. [He starts the tram.]
Finn:  Wup!
DMO:  We are now passing over the famous factory floor. Birthplace of each and every MO. Behold the gleaming machinery! Teeming and wild with the throes of real creation. From this unlikely chaos emerges every shiny new MO.
Jake:  But nothing's moving down there. It's all shut down. What happened to this place?
DMO:  I'm sorry. I'm just a tram MO. I'm not programmed to understand that question. Also, you're just a JMO. You're not programmed to ask that question.
Jake:  Uh, what question?
DMO:  That question- [grunts with frustration]
Jake:  I'm serious...
DMO:  Anyway, MO Co. was founded over 1,000 years ago. By Moseph Mastro Giovanni. A sad and gentle man. Beloved by only those he built to belove him. On your left, you'll see the core system driver installation port bay.
BMO:  [gasps] Finn! Finn! That's it! That's where the driver ports are!
Finn:  I know, I heard!
DMO:  What?! Are you crazy?! Get back here!
Jake:  Hurry, Finn. I think he's calling the police or somethin'!
Finn:  None of these ports fit right! E, D, C, where's the B port?!
SMO 1:  Intruder spotted! Prepare to vaporize! Vaporize!
SMO 1:  Cease fire! No intruder spotted. Vaporization complete.
SMO 2:  Um, but what if they slipped past us, sir? In all the smoke?
SMO 1:  Allllright, everyone. About face. [All four SMOs turn around.] Does anyone see the intruders now? [The other three SMOs look around as the first SMO looks annoyed.] Like I said, vaporization complete. Now let's head back to base. It's donut o' clock.
SMO 3:  Man, how about those goofs? Tryin' to mess with our drivers?
SMO 4:  Yeah. You know the world these days. All goofs. [SMO 4 takes his gun and gets donuts out of the vending machine with it.]
SMO 1:  Hey! You toss me one of them 'nuts? [SMO 4 tosses him a donut while SMO 3 pours coffee on his screen, as if to drink it.] Ah. Yeah, hey, speaking of goofs? Haven't seen SMO 5681 lately.
SMO 3:  [while rubbing a coffee mug on his side] Man, that goof.
SMO 1:  Yeah, I hate that goof. [SMO 1 rubs the donut on his screen like he is eating it.] You ever notice goofs always askin' how you're doin'? What is that? Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
SMO 3:  Yeah, 100%.
SMO 1:  Oh! Hey, what are you doing over there by yourself?
SMO 5:  Uh, oh, I-- I'm sad.
SMO 1:  Oh, yeah, y'know we've all been there. [to the other SMOs:] So anyway, how's your goofy wife doin'?
Finn:  [whispering:] BMO, how are you doing?
BMO:  Get me close to that guy's port. I can hack into his computer and find out where my driver port is! [BMO's screen shows him barfing.]
Jake:  Ah, we gotta hustle!
SMO 1:  [in response to something someone else said:] Yeah, pretty good, I guess. I prefer something yeastier. The wife is always giving me grief about that. But I mean, what am I, decent?
SMO 4:  Hey, what are you two goofs doin'? Goofing?
Jake:  Dang, man, how deep does this place go?
Finn:  Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down. [memorizing it:] Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down.
Finn:  Psych! [Finn, Jake, and BMO start running away.]
SMO 3:  Hey, woah!
Finn:  Down that grate!
DMO:  Hey! Only MOs are allowed in the facility 1,000%! [DMO walks down to where Finn, Jake, and BMO are.] Get off of my tram!
Jake:  Cram your tram! [Jake minimizes to DMO's size. He runs over and kicks DMO off of the tram.] Womp!
Finn:  Hang in there, BMO!
Finn:  Hey, Jake! Can this thing go any fast-
Finn:  Woah! Shoot, it's the fuzz!
DMO:  Hit 'em again!
Finn:  Holy-
Jake:  Finn, how are we getting to BMO's driver port?!
Finn:  Uh, turn right!
Finn:  Dog it, they're still behind us! ["They drive through a 2D DNA-like path. Unlike a strand of DNA, there is only one looping part. Finn and Jake are driving in a straight line down the middle of the 'DNA' as the SMOs tram loops around them.]
Finn:  Turn left!
Finn:  Turn Corkscrew!
Finn:  Now go down!
Finn:  There's a driver port!
Finn:  Too spicy.
Jake:  My bod!
SMO 6:  Non-MOs are forbidden in this facility!
BMO:  [weakly:] I am not non-MO.
BMO:  [louder:] I am BMO!
SMO 6:  [whispering, in awe:] BMO.
Moe:  BMO? Did I hear BMO?
Jake:  Wait, what's up?
Moe:  Hey, I'm Moe! [Moe taps MMO twice on the head. MMO drops him. Moe laughs.] Don't worry! My legs don't work!
Finn:  You're Moe?! Wait, are you human, too?
Moe:  My skin is human!
Jake:  Dude, how old are you?!
Moe:  Hey, come on, now! [Moe crawls over to where BMO is. He turns him so BMO is sitting down.] It is BMO! Looks like there's some software problems! [Moe turns BMO off. He opens his face plate. He looks at the inside of him with a frown.] Hmm.
Finn:  So...you made BMO?
Jake:  [Jake stretches to a large size.] Hey, you're not gonna reset our friend's personality, are you?
Moe:  Huh? What? No...BMO's one of a kind. I built BMO to take care of my son. [A CMO brings over a screwdriver.] Oh, thank you. But I guess I never ended up dating any women. So, that's sad. [Moe chuckles.] I sent BMO off into the world alone. [Moe coughs a couple of times while saying:] Hoping to find a family home. And then maybe even find somebody else's little boy to take care of.
Finn:  Aw.
Moe:  Oh, there's that back-up driver disk! [A CMO is holding a small floppy disk.] Thank you. [The CMO gives him the OK sign and smiles.] [Moe puts the disk drive into a slot in BMO. Some lights flash. The system shoots the disk back out.] That oughta done it. I must've built what, like, a million MOs. But BMO is very, very special. I built BMO to understand fun. And how to play. [extends an arm and something makes a cracking sound] You see, I made BMO to be more. [Moe turns BMO on.]
BMO:  Ooh! Are you my grandpoop?
Moe:  Nah, I'm just your poop.
Jake:  Wait, did you say you built a million robots?
Finn:  Yeah, all we saw was that tram jerk and all those jerky security jerks!
Moe:  Ah, those were just the surface jerks. [to MMO:] Up, please. [MMO lifts him up over himself. He carries him over to a porthole in the ground with a wheel.] Kid, come over here. [He turns the wheel and the scene shows what's inside. There are a couple hundred MOs milling about. We see a QMO watering plants, an unknown MO with wings, two LMOs throwing dice and money, two CMOs playing jump rope with an OMO while a WMO, PMO, and three MOs looking at them.] BMO, say hello to your family.
BMO:  Hello, family.
MOs:  Hi, BMO!
