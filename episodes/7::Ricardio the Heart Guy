Finn:  Hey, fart-face!!
Ice King:  Huh?
Finn:  Unhand Princess Bubblegum!!
Ice King:  Foolish interlopers! Zah! [Fires ice magic at Finn]
Finn:  [Evading it] Whoa! [Throws a snowball at him] Ah!
Ice King:  Ee hee hee heeOOH! [Gets hit by snowball] MY EYESIGHT!
Princess Bubblegum:  Huh? Hee hee hee!
Finn:  Hey, Ice King! I bet you'll never kiss the princess!
Ice King:  I will kiss her! I will! [To "princess"] Hold still. [Kisses Jake's posterior] Mwah!
Finn:  [Laughs] You just kissed Jake's butt!
Ice King:  What?! [Jake reforms his posterior.] EEEEGH!! [The other three laugh.] [Flying away] The hour is yours, but the day shall be mine! Just like you, PrincessMINE!
Princess Bubblegum:  What a patoot. Thanks for saving the day yet again, boys.
Finn:  You're welcome, Princess. [She hugs him.] Uh... [He blushes, and Jake raises his eyebrow, amused.]
Princess Bubblegum:  I'm gonna throw you two a party. Meet at the Candy KingdomTONIGHT!
Jake:  That paper crane for Princess Bubblegum?
Finn:  I just thought I'd bring 'er a gift... in return for throwing us this party.
Jake:  Heh. I bet you wish you were my butt.
Finn:  What?
Jake:  I bet you wish you were my butt, because then the princess would... No, wait... I bet you wish you were the Ice King and the princess was my butt!
Finn:  What?!
Jake:  Hmm... [Snapping] OH! I bet you wish Bubblegum would kiss you, too! Like the Ice King and my butt! Hahahaha!
Finn:  That's ridiculous! [Finn imagines Princess Bubblegum kissing him, and he sighs contentedly.] Huh? Uggghhh!! [Jake runs ahead laughing.] What's so funny?
Peppermint Butler:  Hey, everybody. Finn and Jake are here.
Jake:  Who's ready to party?!
Finn:  What's everyone laughing at?
Wildberry Princess:  Shh!
Ricardio:  Stand back, everyone. This style of massage is called, "Best Friend Massage."
Lumpy Space Princess:  Oh, my gosh...
Ricardio:  Because it can only be done for friends. It is completely consensual.
Lumpy Space Princess:  Oh, holy cow...
Ricardio:  Relax yourself now, Lumpy Space Princess... YAH! [Backflips and pounds her]
Lumpy Space Princess:  Oh! I feel so great!
Finn:  Who is that guy?
Ricardio:  Hahaaa!
Princess Bubblegum:  Greetings, party-goers! Glad you could all make it!
Finn:  Princess Bubblegum! [Ricardio stares at her and he himself starts "beating" hard.] Princess. I just wanted to thank you for
Lumpy Space Princess:  [Cutting in] Oh, my gosh! PB, ya gotta check out this super cute guy. You're gonna love 'im. [They leave Finn and Jake.]
Finn:  Uhhh...
Lumpy Space Princess:  This is... Oh. Oh, my gosh. I don't even know your name.
Ricardio:  Ricardio. Ricardio at your service. I've been waiting all evening to meet you, Princess. [Kissing her hand] Mwah! [Finn pockets his gift, irritated.] I've heard you appreciate ancient technology. Have you ever used the balbaflonic laser to align the hybernotalist rift in the bubaflon plasmodial formation?
Princess Bubblegum:  Whoa! No, I haven't! [Music starts up; crowd moves to the dance floor.] Wanna continue this conversation on the dance floor?
Ricardio:  [Exiting with her] It would be my pleasure, Princess.
Finn:  Why didn't the princess invite me to dance?
Jake:  If you wanna dance, just go dance!
Finn:  But now she's dancing with him! Ah... I feel... weird!
Jake:  Huh, it sounds like you're dealing with some new emotions you don't understand... like jealousy.
Finn:  BLAAAARGH!!
Jake:  Look, man, just go out there and get down! [Pushes him onto the dance floor]
Ricardio:  [To Princess Bubblegum] transmordial layers completely independent of the babylons. Eh?
Princess Bubblegum:  Wow! That would mean that the babylons would fluctuate with the piranha-nanosphere!
Ricardio:  Correct!
Finn:  Agh! [Goes back to Jake] They're talkin' about science, man! I can't compete with that!
Jake:  Do the Science Dance! Remember it? It was sorta like this. [Does it] Wah unh we ah eeh...
Finn:  You think that'll work?
Jake:  Yeah! Probably. [Pushes him back onto the dance floor] Do it, man! You're a pro!
Finn:  [Dancing] Science Dance! Science Dance!
Ricardio:  [Still talking with Bubblegum] lower proximities to
Finn:  Science Dance! Hey, eh, Princess! You wanna spend some time with me?
Ricardio:  Excuse me, Princess. You must excuse me. [Exits]
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, uh... Alright! [To Finn] Finn, what the cabbage? I was learning about Zanoits!
Finn:  [Prevaricating] Oh... I'm... into Zanoits! Th-They're the best!
Princess Bubblegum:  Zanoits kill hundreds of thousands of Plantoids a year.
Finn:  Oh, no, not the Plantoids!
Princess Bubblegum:  Plantoids produce mellotoxin! [Finn stares.] Mellotoxin kills Zanoits!!
Finn:  ...So are Zanoits... good things?
Princess Bubblegum:  [Changing the subject] You're totally jealous of Ricardio.
Finn:  No, I'm not. I just don't like the way he talks to you. It makes me feel weird.
Princess Bubblegum:  That's jealousy, hun.
Finn:  I'm not jealous! I'M WEIRD!!!
Jake:  [To himself] Woof! Man... This is goin' bad. Hey, Finn. You gotta come help me slay these peanut monsters at the bar. It can't wait. [He and Finn are alone.] Wow, man, what happened out there?
Finn:  Agh... I don't know! I was tryin' to warn 'er, but she twisted my words around and
Jake:  Yeah. Ladies are twisty, man. Bubblegum's super smart, too.
Finn:  I know! And I can't shake this weird feeling about Ricardio. I think he's... a villain.
Jake:  Why? Is it because his face is so foldy and dramatic?
Finn:  No! I can just feel it in my gut! He's up to something sinister!
Jake:  Maybe what you feel is romantic rivalry.
Finn:  I'll prove he's a villain!
Jake:  How?
Finn:  Stakeout.
Finn:  Here he comes! [Viewing Ricardio and Princess Bubblegum] They're talking!
Jake:  Lemme see. [Gets binoculars] I can read their lips. [Mimicking Princess Bubblegum] "Hey, shorty, you should pick your boogers and then fart!" [Mimicking Ricardio] "You look kind of like a big pink baguette!"
Finn:  [Taking back binoculars] Get serious, Jake!! This is life and death!
Jake:  Is it? Don't get me wrong. I'm all about stakeouts and spying on this guy, but what if he's not a villain? What if he just looks wicked? Some people look wicked but are super nice.
Finn:  I gotta trust my gut!
Jake:  [Grabbing gut] Hmm.
Finn:  He's on the move! Let's roll! [The two swing onto a Guardian of the Royal Promise.] I see 'im. He's holding rope and going into the trash. He's smashing bottlesand pretending to stab someone!
Jake:  So... he's recycling... or what?
Finn:  [Takes off binoculars] I think your gut's a little naive, Jake. [Puts on binoculars] Holy moly! He's... he's with the Ice King! They're shouting something! [Ice King and Ricardio quarrel.] Ricardio is tossing him in the dumpster and running away!
Jake:  So I was right! He is a good guy who's just cursed to look suspicious! [To gut] You and me, gut! Together forever! Solvin' crimes and makin' up rhymes!
Finn:  No way. This proves he's a super-villain! More powerful than lesser villains like the Ice King!
Finn:  Then it's settled! We're gonna confront Ricardio face-to-face and prove he's evil!
Jake:  Or good!
Ricardio:  Oof!
Finn:  So what're you doin', Ricardio? Are you evil?
Jake:  Or nice with an evil face?
Ricardio:  That's none of your business.
Finn:  The safety of Princess Bubblegum is my business!
Jake:  Yeah, we just wanna know if you're evil or not.
Ricardio:  Oh, yeah?
Finn & Jake [In unison]:  Yeah.
Ricardio:  Oh, yeah?
Jake:  Yeah. [Slightly annoyed] Yes!
Finn:  You stay away from Princess Bubblegum with all that stuff!
Ricardio:  Now that my plan is nearly complete, there is no way you could stop me.
Finn:  I could stop you if I wanted!
Ricardio:  Oh, yeah?
Finn:  Yeah!
Ricardio:  Oh, yeah??
Finn:  YEEEAAAH!!!
Princess Bubblegum:  [Gasps] What's going on here?
Finn:  Princess?!
Princess Bubblegum:  Ricardio?!
Ricardio:  [Weakly] Yes... I'm alright, Princess.
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn... why'd you do it?
Finn:  He was gonna hurt you with those ropes and bottles!
Princess Bubblegum:  These were for our balbaflonic laser.
Ricardio:  It's not all his fault, Princess. I might've looked a little threatening.
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn... you shouldn't punch brainiacs. You know how fragile they are! You gotta stop this jealous business.
Finn:  But...
Princess Bubblegum:  C'mon, Ricardio. I'll patch you up and give you candy. [They exit.]
Finn:  [Sigh] She hates me now. I was totally wrong about Ricardio.
Ice King:  No, Finn! [Emerges from dark alleyway] You were not wrong. He is evil! [Collapses]
Finn:  Ice King! What do you know about this? Tell me or I'll do something!
Jake:  Hold up, Finn! The Ice King looks sorta damaged!
Finn:  I don't care! I only care about Ricardio!
Ice King:  But my enervated condition has everything to do with him. [Flashback begins; Ice King does voice-over] I was trying to cast a spell that would give me total control of Princess Bubblegum's heart! ...But I messed it all up... and lost control of mine. [Ricardio come's out of Ice King's chest in flashback. He runs towards the window laughing.] He planned to rip out Princess Bubblegum's heart... to make it his bride. [Ricardio sticks his tongue out and exits laughing.] Without my heart, I grew weak. [Ice King groans in flashback.] But I made my way to the Candy Kingdom to look for him. In an alleyway, I begged him to [In flashback, Ice King mouths these words as current Ice King says them] return to me and leave the princess alone. [Flashback ends.] But he threw me in the dumpster and left me for dead. [Reaching his hand out at Finn] Stop Ricardio!
Finn:  [Slapping hand away] Agh! Come on, Jake! [They run to the Candy Castle.] Gotta save the princess!
Jake:  Princess Bubblegum!!
Finn:  Princess!! [Gasps]
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn!! Jake!!
Ricardio:  You were right all along, Finn! Now I'm going to cut out Princess Bubblegum's heart and make out with it!
Finn:  Not if I can help it!
Ricardio:  One step closer and I'll remove her heart!!
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn! I feel like a big idiot for doubting you! He was just so engaging! ...But his knowledge on plantoids is actually pretty weak.
Ricardio:  Shut your mouth up, Princess! [Jake knocks Ricardio down by stretching his jowl at him.] I'm gonna smooch that heart!! It will be my bride!!
Finn:  Why don't you marry someone your own size?! Like my foot?!
Ricardio:  Huh?!
Finn:  And my fist?!
Ice King:  [Crawling in] Stop! Stop it! That's my heart, you piece of
Finn:  Ice King. [Ice King crawls towards Ricardio.] Should we... let 'im take his heart back? He is... villainous...
Jake:  I don't wanna watch an old man die on Princess Bubblegum's carpet, man.
Ice King:  Oh, yeah...
Ricardio:  Wait! Wait! No!
Ice King:  Come to daddy...
Ricardio:  Noooooooooo!
Ice King:  Yeah, there you go... [Puts him in his chest] Like that? Huh?
Ricardio:  [Sinking into chest] Seeee you guys laterrrr...
Ice King:  [Reinvigorated] I feel wonderful! Hahaha! And now that I've saved the Princess, she'll marry me and live in my dungeon every day!
Finn:  No, she won't!
Princess Bubblegum:  Yeah, no, I won't!
Ice King:  Yes you WILL! [He charges up his ice magic, but Finn kicks him. He begins flying away.] Well... maybe not today... or tomorrow... but another day! Another[Accidentally knocks head on door frame. He grunts in pain as he exits.]
Princess Bubblegum:  Thanks again for saving me... again.
Finn:  [Mouth full] Don't mention it.
Princess Bubblegum:  Now that Ricardio's gone, you don't have to be jealous of anyone anymore. [Winks]
Finn:  I never get jealous.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Romantically] Kiss me, Finn. [Finn blushes, astonished.] Ahem. [She is doing a hand-stand and wearing a Jake mask on her posterior. She uses a deeper voice.] I mean... kiss me, Finn. [Normal voice, whispering] Am I doing it right, Jake?
Finn:  NOOOOOOOO!!!
