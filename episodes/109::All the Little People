Finn:  Hey, Jake, do you think you should date someone just like you or someone who's like your opposite?
Jake:  I don't know. I'm the "first come first serve" kinda guy. Get in line, ladies! This Rainicorn thing can't last forever! [chuckles] [Magic Man peeks out from under a strip of grass, unnoticed by Finn and Jake] I didn't mean that. Don't spread that around.
Finn:  So it's not good to weigh someone's qualities against your own?
Jake:  Well, no. I mean, if you feel something, you feel something! [Jake's head turns into a graph and his hand an upward moving arrow] It's not about personality matrixals and charts, it's all about the bu-bumps in your heart! [His head is a heart shape that beats every time he say "bumps" or "pumps". He gets extremely close to Finn and his eyes are bugging out] You can't stop the pumps and bumps! Pumps and bumps! Pumps and bumps! [Finn chuckles, as does Magic Man]
Finn:  Alright, well, what about BMO and Ice King?
Jake:  What about them? [Looks confused]
Finn:  Would they make a good couple?
Jake:  Whoa! Wait! Did BMO say something to you?
Finn:  No no!
Jake:  Oh, I see. You're being weird.
Finn:  It's not that weird! Come on!
Magic Man [quietly]:  Do what thoust will be the whole piece of Law.
Jake:  BMO and Ice King?
Finn:  Yeah!
Magic Man [quietly]:  I'm not coming back. [Retreats into his hole]
Jake:  You're creepin' me out. [Gets up]
Finn:  I'm just thinkin' out loud. [Jake starts walking away and Finn bends forward so he can see Jake between his legs] What, can't think out loud?
Jake:  Oh, is that what you're doing?
Finn:  Yeah man! Pffft, jeez don't be judgy.
Jake:  I'm not!
Finn:  Yeah, you are!
Jake:  How could you know that?
Finn:  I can hear it in your tone.
Jake:  You can? [in a mocking tone]
Finn:  Yeah, wise-guy.
Jake:  [Pointing to the bag] Hey, what's that in your pants?
Finn:  [Looking at the back of his pants] What?! Not again! [Finn sees the bag on the other side] Oh. I don't know. [Finn grabs the bag] Whoa, look.
Jake:  Crazy. [Finn opens the bag and reaches in] Careful, dude.
Finn:  What the--? [Finn pulls out his hand with Princess Bubblegum, Lumpy Space Princess, BMO, Jake, and himself]
Jake:  What the heck?! Are they alive?! [They are now moving around aimlessly]
Finn:  Hey, are you guys alive? [BMO starts to fall off, but Jake catches him] I don't know, man, I think they're some kind of magic toy.
Jake:  Maybe it's black magic. Maybe we shouldn't mess with them.
Finn:  No, man, look! That's you! [Jake is playing the viola with Lumpy Space Princess on his back and Finn and BMO are dancing to the music] You're totally shedding on the viola.
Jake:  Yeah, that's good. How many more thingies are in there?
Finn:  [Looks in the bag] Dude. Like a lot. Come on! Let's check this out at the house. [They run towards the house]
Jake:  I'll make a special spagot [spaghetti] with a new sauce.
Finn:  Sheesh. So many. PB, you hang out with Lady. [Picks up Princess Bubblegum and moves her towards Lady] C-listers, go back in the bag. [Pushes Xergiok, Donny, Tiffany, Lemongrab, one of the Gumdrop lasses, and'Turtle Princess]
Jake:  [stirring the noodles] Who's in the C-list? [Adds something, possibly wine, from a bottle, then dumps some spaghetti onto each plate]
Finn:  Tiffany, Donny. [To himself] Well, he's okay. [Out loud] Xergiok... a bunch o' these guys!
Jake:  That's not very nice. [Turns off the stove and brings the food to the table]
Finn:  Don't worry, man. They'll get involved eventually.
Jake:  Involved with what? [Sits down and gives Finn his food]
Finn:  I don't know. Involved. Check out Lady and Princess Bubblegum!
Jake:  [Stretches to get forks. Lady and Princess Bubblegum are having a conversation. It looks as though Princess Bubblegum is asking Lady questions] What are they talkin' about?
Finn:  It's hard to say, but I think it's got something to do with Lady being preggos [pregnant].
Jake:  Whoa! What kinda narrative are you trying to create here?!
Finn:  That's your narrative, buddy.
Jake:  Alright, well, what else ya got goin' on?
Finn:  Hmm. Not much really. I got Ice King over here. [Points to Ice King]
Jake:  Ice King? He's not C-list?
Finn:  [Looking through the bag to find Ice King's drum kit] Yeah, well, I saw his drum kit in here. Here we go. [Puts it in front of Ice King] Okay, jam out, little Ice King. [Ice King starts playing]
Jake:  [Little Jake sees the Ice King playing and runs over to him to join in] No. Don't play with that hack. Aww, man. Hmm. [Jake looks surprised] They've got good chemistry. Who'd have guessed?
Finn:  Chemistry...
Jake:  Hey, Finn, eat the food before it gets cold. [Pops up from behind Flame Princess and Lumpy Space Princess] I made a new sauce! Umm, earth to Finn, are you okay?
Finn:  Yeees.
Finn:  Whoooooa.
Jake:  [Jake wakes up and heads down stairs. Finn is sitting at the dinner table with a multitude of Jay T. Doggzone books arranged into a little town] You're up early.
Finn:  I didn't sleep. [Very blunt and tired]
Jake:  [Comes back to the table with a drink in a mug] You stay up all night readin' trash books? [Finn makes a weak "meh" sound.] I told you, man. Those datin' books. [Sips drink] That stuff is mess you up. [Drinks again]
Finn:  I'm not reading. I'm playing with the little wees.
Jake:  Oh, let me see little me. [Stretches his head to find little Jake is sitting by himself next to an open book] Me look so lonely. Hey, Finn, pass me little Lady.
Finn:  Uh, you guys broke up.
Jake:  [Confused] Wha?
Finn:  She's with someone else now.
Jake:  [Angry] Who?!
Finn:  He's a cool guy, don't worry about it.
Jake:  [Hears Lady laughing and goes to the source. He finds little Finn in Lady's lap kissing under a book teepee] Ahhhhhh! [Slams his fists on the table] What the ball, man?!
Finn:  [Laughs and shrugs; he doesn't sound as worn out as before] What?
Jake:  What? What do ya think "what"?!
Finn:  Come on, they're not real, they're like toys. These guys here, they're goin' out. [Points the Marceline and Peppermint Butler in a tea cup. Marceline licks the red off of Peppermint Butler's side.] Pretty serious. And look at Choose Goose and Lollipop Girl. They're still testing the waters. [Choose Goose and Lollipop Girl are dancing and are joined by Abracadaniel] But I think things are gonna work out. Check out Xergiok and Turtle P. [Turtle Princess is seen lightly spanking Xergiok. Finn laughs.] Weird. But cool. Right, Jake?
Jake:  [slowly backs towards the exit] I don't like where you're going with this. It ain't wholesome. I'm gonna go to Lady's for a few days. To clear my head. [Leaves]
Finn:  Okay. Whatever whatevs. [Goes over to little Finn and Lady and chuckles] Weird. [Grabs little Finn and Flame Princess] Huh?
Jake:  I'm back! I got over all that messed up stuff you did. [The tree house is covered in trash and Finn looks awful] Yeesh. You okay, man?
Finn:  I don't know.
Jake:  What's little Finn doing?
Finn:  He's... thinking.
Jake:  [Looks concerned] He looks sad. What's he thinking about?
Finn:  I don't know. Probably lots of stuff.
Jake:  Where's little Rainicorn?
Finn:  Probably still crying.
Jake:  Wha?
Finn:  She's not handling the break-up very well.
Jake:  [sees Lady still crying in her teepee] Aww.
Finn:  PB's good, though. [Princess Bubblegum is on a weight bench lifting weights and she has become very toned. She looks very angry.] After little Finn dumped her, she started working out. Looks like she's really into it.
Jake:  This is messed up, dude. You've crossed the line from weird curiosity to some dark messed up stuff.
Finn:  [Looks perturbed] I know!
Jake:  [Marceline has licked away half of Peppermint Butler] The destruction! [Xergiok looks like he's in pain and Turtle Princess is furiously spanking him] The depravity! [Choose Goose, Abracadaniel, and Lollipop Girl are all tangled up together] The wrongness of it all! I'm taking that bag back to the cliff where we found it. [Tries to grab them but Finn grabs his arms.]
Finn:  No, man! I gotta fix this mess! Look at me, man! I'm staring into the shadow of my darkest mind hole! I gotta help him!
Jake:  You can't! Just let them do their own biz, man!
Finn:  I junked them up too hard though! I gotta step in!
Jake:  How would ya do that?
Finn:  [Lets go of his arms and Jake steps back] I'm gonna talk to him.
Jake:  But he can't hear you.
Finn:  Yeah, why is that?
Jake:  Hmm. Maybe we're on different dimensional planes and the border between our planes is like a two way mirror. So we can see him, but he can't see us.
Finn:  [Gets really close to little Finn] Lemme try this. Finn! Can you hear me? [Sticks his tongue out while talking and pokes little Finn a few times] We're connected! FINN!
Jake:  Try shakin' him.
Finn:  Why?
Jake:  Maybe we're vibrating on different intervals. Try shakin' him at different speeds and see if he responds.
Finn:  [Grabs him and starts shaking] Okay. Fiiiiiiinn! Fiiiiiiiiiinn!
Jake:  Now go faster!
Finn:  FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINN!
Jake:  Faster!
Finn:  [The cloud Finn says this in the Little People's world] FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINN! [The clouds dissipate and little Finn looks surprised]
Jake:  Go slower, he saw you!
Finn:  Okay. [In the Little People's world] Fiiiinn. Can you hear me?
Little Finn:  Wah wah wah.
Jake:  Whoa! Neat!
Finn:  I made you do those crummy things. I'm why yous guys is fighting. I'm the big you. I came to apologize. I will never interfere with your lives again. [Little Finn asks a question] Don't worry I will take care of it. [The clouds dissipate and then reassemble] Sorry, my arm got tired. [Little Finn is confused by this.] Never mind. It'll be fine. Goodbye, little Finn! I'm not coming back!
Jake:  Now what?
Finn:  [shaking Lady, Princess Bubblegum, and Flame Princess at the same time and they all see the cloud] Hey, ladies! This is big Finn! I caused all the problems! It wasn't anyone's fault! Don't be mad at each other! Have a... dance party! Okay, goodbye! I'm not coming back! [Finn pulls a stereo out of the bag and starts the music. The three of them begin dancing and with the others.]
Jake:  Is that gonna do it? [The little people join the party and start dancing] Get the C-listers out. [They begin dancing as well] Good party. Oh, flip! [BMO and the Ice King are dancing] Look who's hittin' it off with the Ice King! [Chuckles]
