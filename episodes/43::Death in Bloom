Princess Bubblegum:  [Sips tea] Ah fudge! What time is it? I gotta go to Veggie Village for the Annual Technology Fair. Will y'all watch my Princess Plant for me? [Hands Finn a flower with a green stem and white petals] I usually hire a sitter but- Ehn!
Finn:  Of course, Princess!
Princess Bubblegum:  Awesome! Thank you, Finn. I will be back on the Morrow. SCREEEEEEEE!
Finn:  You're in good hands, Princess Plant.
Finn:  And then the monster got punched in the head and the princess was safe. And everyone was happy!
Finn:  [Gasps and screams]
Finn:  Time to lay down beautiful buddy.
Jake:  Yeah. Time to make sleepies!
Finn:  Ahhh. We killed it, man!
Jake:  I know!
Finn:  Okay. [Grabs Jake] All we gotta do, is go to the Land of the Dead and reclaim the flower's soul from death before Bubblegum returns.
Jake:  Okay!
Peppermint Butler:  Excuse me, but did you all say Land of the Dead?
Finn:  Oh, what?! Oh, uh... yeah.
Peppermint Butler:  I can take you.
Finn:  Really?
Peppermint Butler:  Certainly, Finn. [Walks into corner of the room] For a small price. Which we can discuss later! Take my hands, gentlemen! [Raises arms.]
Peppermint Butler:  Stare into where the two walls meet. Now slowly, cross your eyes. [Crosses eyes] Do it, fools!
Peppermint Butler:  The portal opens!
Peppermint Butler:  Say 'hi' to Death for me if you see him! He lives in a castle made of light!
Jake:  Uh... okay.
Finn:  Thanks Peppermint Butler. [Him and Jake wave goodbye.]
Peppermint Butler:  And don't drink the- [The portal closes] water.
Jake:  Whoa man, who knew Peppermint Butler was so- [Clings to Finn as they both scream.]
Jake:  So... um... you wanna... [Stretches out a kangaroo pouch] hop in my paunch and I'll stretch us down?
Finn:  Uh... Oh look, an escalator!
Finn:  [To skeleton] Hey, dude.
Finn:  That must be the main entrance or some biz!
Jake:  Let's go!
Finn:  Holy schmow!
Gate Guardian:  [To a skeleton with spear in it's throat] Welcome to the Underworld. Cause of death?
Spear Skeleton:  Uh... Spear in the neck.
Gate Guardian:  You may enter.
Spear Skeleton:  Yay! [Runs inside]
Gate Guardian:  How did you die?
Finn:  Uh...
Finn and Jake:  [Thinks of something to say] Because we're awesome! [They high five] Whoo! Ha ha! Ha ha!
Gate Guardian:  Hmm... Step out of line. [Points to the side]
Finn:  Awh dingle!
Jake:  Wait up, dude! Follow me, and do as I do. [The two begin to slowly side-step to the entrance]
Gate Guardian:  [Points to them] Hey! I said no!
Gate Guardian:  Hey! Hey!!
Jake:  Ha ha, we're in! Come on, man!
Gate Guardian:  [Peers into the entrance] Man...
Finn:  Yes!
Jake:  Yes!
Finn:  Where do we go now, dude?
Jake:  [Points to the top of a hill] Up there!
Finn & Jake:  Oooooo!
Jake:  Death's castle is pretty, dude.
Finn:  Let's go! [The two jump down and do a little battle cry.]
Skeleton Guy (Lester):  Hey! What's up, fellas! Hi. Lester. [Grabs Finn's arm.] Oh man, flesh! Haven't seen this stuff in forever! [Caresses Finn's arm] So warm and gushy and softy! [Shakes Finn's arm up and down.] Look at all that flesh jigglin'!
Jake:  Hey! If you love flesh so much, then watch this! [Stretches so he looks like he is melting onto the ground.]
Lester:  Whoo! You don't know what you're doing to me, guy! Fellas get over here! Flesh!
Finn:  [Whispers to Jake] This is weird, man.
Jake:  Don't worry! They just think we're cool!
Finn:  Hmm... Do you guys think we're cool?
Lester:  No. We're gonna rip that flesh off you! And eat it!
Finn:  It's bone-kicking time! [Punches the heads off skeletons but they get up and put them back on.]
Skeleton:  [Laughs.]
Finn:  Oh shoot! Get- [Tries to fight back with a bone, but the skeletons swarm him and begin to bite him.]
Finn:  Jake! There's too many!
Jake:  [Coughs, skeletons are biting him as well.] They're tryin' to peel me! [Stretches largely and knocks a bunch of skeletons off of him.] I... am not... a banana! [Grabs Finn and runs away. He sees a hole.] Hole! [Puts Finn in the hole.]
Finn:  It's not a hole, Jake! It's just a divot!
Jake:  Sorry! [Jumps into hole and covers rocky with it.]
Finn:  Dude, shrink down!
Jake:  Oh! Sorry.
Finn:  I don't like the underworld too much.
Jake:  I don't know. Wouldn't be so bad if there weren't folks trying to eat our skin.
Finn:  I wonder how Princess Bubblegum is doing.
Princess Bubblgum:  So! Who here invented this thing?
Finn:  I'm glad she's not coming back 'till tomorrow.
Jake:  No she said she's coming back "on the Morrow."
Finn:  Yeah, on the 'morrow. That means tomorrow.
Jake:  No man, the Morrow is her bird!
Finn:  Come again?
Jake:  It's her bird! That thing is crazy fast! It'll only take like twenty minutes to get back once that conference is over. [Camera pans on a shocked Finn.] Are you listening, man? [Camera pans on Jake's mouth in slow motion] The Morrow, is a bird. [Morrow appears from Jake's mouth and screeches.]
Finn:  We gotta go! [Lifts up rock and peers out.] Coast is clear!
Skeleton:  Halt! [Finn & Jake freeze in place.] Hey! [Taps a skeleton named Halt's shoulder] Hey Halt! Why you got your eyes closed, Halt?
Halt:  I'm trying to picture in my mind's eye where the fleshies are hiding.
Skeleton:  Ooh! You're a smart guy, Halt!
Finn:  [Grabs Jake's arm] Wait, Jake! Do you hear somethin'? Come on! [They crawl to the edge of the bridge and peak over.]
Group of Skeletons:  [Murmuring] I didn't see them... They were here, and now they're gone!...
Finn:  More skeletons! We've gotta be really, really quiet!
Skeleton:  Get em!
Finn:  Jake!
Jake:  I thought it would be funny!
Finn & Jake:  Ahh!
Finn:  [Points] Look! There's Death's castle!
Finn:  [Looks around] I don't see anyone! I guess you double killed them with that avalanche!
Jake:  Heh, awesome!
Finn:  Now we just gotta cross that river!
Jake:  River! [They walk down the stairs towards the river.] Man, I'm so thirsty! My mouth's still all dusty!
SkulL: Yes... [Finn screams.] Drink the water...
Finn:  Whoa, okay Jake, don't drink the water!
Jake:  Come one! I'm so thirsty!
Finn:  Dude! That skull wants you to drink the water! It's bad water!
Skull:  Don't drink the water!
Jake:  See? That means good right? [Cannon-balls into the river.]
Finn:  Jake...
Finn:  Jake? Why you makin' stupid face?
Jake:  Who's Jake?
Finn:  Dang it, I knew that water was junk!
Skull: Tricked again by the River of Forgetfulness!
Finn:  Jake! Get out of that water right now!
Jake:  Hey! I don't know who you are, mister! But I don't like your attitude!
Jake:  Help! Somebody!
Princess Bubblegum:  Farewell everyone! [Vegetables do not respond.] Okay... Morrow! Back to the Candy Kingdom!
Jake:  Help! Somebody help me! Stranger danger!
Death:  Hey! Hey! I see you!
Finn:  Jake! Your head!
Jake:  [Peeks out from behind tree] Huh? [To Death] Who are you?
Death:  Who are you?
Jake:  I don't know, man, who are you?
Death:  What do you mean, you're in my castle!
Jake:  Well I didn't know!
Finn:  Dang it, Jake.
Death:  You must leave this place. Now!
Finn:  [Jumps out from behind tree and begins to talk in a ghost-like voice] Death! We're not leaving until our plant's soul! And Jake's memory! 
Death:  Another one, be gone mortal!
Finn:  No! I promised Princess Bubblegum! [Attempts to kick Death but flies right through him.] Oof! Oww... What happened?
Death:  You can't kick me because your brain is stupid!
Finn:  Your brain is stupid!
Jake:  Hehehehehehe, this kid's pretty funny!
Death:  [Sighs] Alright. [Drops rake and walks over to stage with wall full of musical instruments.] Pick an instrument.
Finn:  Huh?
Death:  [Sits down at a drum set with two base drums and a microphone.] To get stuff from me, you have to beat me in a musical battle. But Jake's the musical one! And he's got poo brain!
Death:  I don't care.
Finn:  I gotta find what I can really play! Oh glob, man! [Begins to breath heavily] Oh! Here we go! [Picks up sleigh bells from the instrument wall.] Sleigh bells! YA WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW!
Death:  So the contest begins!
Death:  [Walks over next to Finn] Hey, alright, so, who do you think won?
Jake:  Oh man, skeleton guy by a landslide! He was like "Rughhh," he was like [Makes exploding noise].
Finn:  Dude!
Jake:  What? Skeleton guy was awesome! You want me to lie?
Finn:  Yes! [Throws sleigh bells away.]
Death:  I'm going to kill you now.
Finn:  No! I still have to rescue stuff!
Death:  [Walks towards Finn with red eyes] Those are the rules in the Land of the Dead, lose a music battle, lose your life. [Eyes begin to flame.]
Finn:  Oh wait, wait, wait! Before I die, I'm honor-bound to tell you: Peppermint Butler says 'Hi'.
Death:  What? You know Peppermint Butler?!
Finn:  Yeah!
Death:  Heh heh heh! Yo, you guys can have whatever you want! [Walks over to Jake.] Jake, stand up!
Jake:  That's me, right? [Stands up]
Death:  Yes. [Goes very close to Jake's face]
Jake:  What're you doin'?
Jake:  What're you doin' ?!
Death:  Kiss of death, baby. You got your memory back.
Jake:  Awh, gross! I wish I didn't!
Death:  Now I shall return the soul of this. [Raises hat, which has the Princess Plant underneath it.]
Finn & Jake:  Yeah! The Princess Plant!
Death:  See ya dudes later. [Teleports them back to Ooo.] [At the Candy Kingdom, Princess Bubblegum arrives on Morrow, where Finn & Jake are waiting for her.]
Princess Bubblegum:  Hello, boys. Where's my plant?
Peppermint Butler:  Hello, Princess!
Princess Bubblegum: Yay! [Eats one of the three flowers, much to the shock of Finn & Jake. Her hair then becomes smaller and curlier at the ends.] Thank you all for taking such good care of my plant! Now come here and give me a hug!
Finn & Jake:  Yay, hugs!
Peppermint Butler:  [Whispers] Ahem. Mr. Finn, Mr. Jake, I believe you still owe me something in exchange for that favor I did.
Finn:  Sure!
Jake:  Yeah, what is it?
Peppermint Butler:  I'd like your flesh.
Jake:  Quit bein' silly, Peppermint Butler!
Peppermint Butler:  [His pupils turn yellow and the area around his eyes turn black.] I'm going to take it from you while you sleep.
