Finn:  Candy Party! Jake! This party is so crazy!
Jake:  I know, Finn! I know! [Laughing]
Gumdrop Lass 1:  So, Finn... Do you have a girlfriend?
Gumdrop Lass 2:  Oh, my gosh! I can't believe you just said that.
Punch Bowl:  [Laughing] What a wonderful, marvelous party!
Cinnamon Bun:  Okay. I'm gonna do it. Okay-okay-okay. Everyone watch! I'm gonna do a flip!
Cinnamon Bun:  Oh no!
Finn:  Princess Bubblegum's in trouble!
Candy Person:  Watch where you're going!
Princess Bubblegum:  Ahhhhhhhhhh!
Princess Bubblegum:  Please! Calm yourselves, my people. I am safe! Oh, thank you, Finn. You truly are my hero this day.
Finn:  Cool.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Pondering] Hero... Hmmm... Heeeeerroooo... Hey, I just thought of something!
Finn:  Uhh... What'd you think of?
Princess Bubblegum:  I'll show you. Come on! We'll go through my secret entrance. [To the Candy People] Alright, everyone. Turn around.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Whispering] Well, turn around. This entrance is secret.
Candy People:  Oh.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Pulling a brick out of a wall, exposing a hole] Math. Hurry, Finn!
Finn:  [Laughing] No way!
Princess Bubblegum:  [Pulling a yellow globe out of a chest] Here it is. Check it out.
Finn:  A magical globe?
Princess Bubblegum:  No, Finn. It's what you can see through the globe.
Finn:  Golly!
Princess Bubblegum:  [Giggle] Look. See this book?
Finn:  Yeah, I see it!
Princess Bubblegum:  It's called the Enchiridion. It's a book meant only for heroes whose hearts are righteous.
Finn:  Shmow-zow!
Princess Bubblegum:  The book lies at the top of Mount Cragdor, guarded by a manly minotaur. It's waiting for a truly righteous hero to claim it!
Finn:  Do you think I've got the goods, Bubblegum? 'Cause I am in to this stuff!
Princess Bubblegum:  Yeah, I know. And yes, I do.
Finn:  Then off I go!
Finn:  Jaaaaaaaaake!
Finn:  Thanks, pal.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Waving] Farewell, FiOh, wait a minute... [reaching into her belt, she pulls out a handkerchief and waves it] Farewell, Finn the human boy!
Finn:  Bye, Princess! [To Jake] You know what time it is, buddy?
Jake:  Aaaaadventure time?
Finn:  Yeah, man!
Key-per:  Greetings, young heroes to be. This mountain is called Cragdor. Its purpose is two-fold: To protect the Enchiridion and to test the hearts of those who seek to possess it. Many noble challengers have entered the temple to pass the grueling trials that lie behind these walls, but no one has ever left here alive or dead! Only the truest most worthy hero can receive the heroes' Enchiridion and walk out these doors again! If it is you, friend, [giggles] and I cannot say that I am certain, but you are verily welcome to try; However, first you must pass my riddle. My name is Key-per, and duly so, for I carry the key to this door, but all is not how it appears, you see. Or perhaps you do not see at all. [Giggles] Perhaps the key is in you, child, but you cannot use your brawn here. The door is magically sealed.
Key-per:  Oh ho! You've unlocked the riddle of the door. [Laughing] Brilliantly done, child! Please, reveal to me how you unraveled my clue.
Finn:  I just thought you'd look cute stuffed in that lock.
Key-per:  Oh, yes. That's how most people get in.
Finn:  Bye!
Key-per:  You've passed the first trial, young heroes, but prepare yourselves! [To the camera] For there are many trials ahead of you, and each trial is more treacherous than the last.
Jake:  [Sniffs] Enchiridion is... [sniffs more, points] That way.
Finn:  What?! Dude! You can't smell the book from here!
Jake:  It's in the castle on top of the mountain. [Sniffs] In a room. [Laughing and tapping his nose] Wish you had one, huh?
Finn:  [Running towards the voices] This way!
Jake:  What about the book?
Finn:  It can wait. Someone needs our help.
Jake:  Yo, Finn. Are you alright? Did you get brain damage?
Finn:  I'm fine! Keep going! We have to hurry!
Finn:  I gotcha.
Red Gnome:  Thank you for saving us. [Voice becomes menacing] Now we can destroy this old lady!
Old Lady:  La la la-la!
Finn:  What?!
Red Gnome:  Every time you say "what" we'll destroy an old lady.
Finn:  [Shocked] What?!
Red Gnome:  Every time you say "no" we'll destroy an old lady.
Finn:  [Panicked] No! Wai...
Finn:  Please...
Finn:  Don't destroy...
Finn:  Anymore...
Finn:  Old women.
Red Gnome:  Every time you look sad we'll destroy a big old woman!
Big Old Woman:  Well... Ever since I got the... [Zapping sounds] Ahhhh!
Red Gnome:  [To other gnomes] Hey, guys. Every time he's a big wuss, let's destroy an old lady.
Other Gnomes:  [Laughing] Yeah!
Jake:  Hey! Back off, you gnomes! That kid just saved you guys! You should thank him, not destroy old ladies! Do you even know what I'm talking about? Say thank you! Say... Thank... You.
Red Gnome:  Kill him!
Jake:  [Shoving the gnomes back into the lava pit] Get back in there!
Jake:  Hey, Finn. You okay?
Finn:  No way, dude. Those old ladies are destroyed because of me. I'm not righteous. I'm wrongteous. Stupidteous.
Jake:  Awww. Don't let those gnomes and their illusions get you down. They're just gnomes and illusions.
Finn:  Illusions?
Jake:  Yeah, man. Think. What would regular, old, sweet ladies be doing wandering the hills of Mount Cragdor?
Finn:  Maybe they're lost?
Jake:  [Laughing] No way. This place is designed to mess you up. To mess with your head. None of this is real. It's all just trials to test your heroic attributes.
Finn:  Hmmm... Hmmm!
Jake:  Now let's go get that book.
Finn:  Yeah! You're the smartest dog I know, man.
Finn:  Jake? Jaaaaaaaake!
Ogre:  You cannot pass!
Finn:  Gimme back my friend!
Ogre:  No!
Jake:  [Popping out of the ogre's nostril] It's ok, Finn! I can get out!
Finn:  Let Jake go, or I'll... [kicking the ogre's foot] I'll kick your foot!
Ogre:  [Laughing] It is impossible for you to hurt me!
Jake:  [Popping out of the ogre's ear and laughing] Don't worry, dude! I found another wayoof!
Finn:  Huh? [Starts climbing the ogre's leg] I'm coming, buddy!
Ogre:  [Long burp] I think your dog finally fell into my stomach. Hey... Where'd you go?
Finn:  [Pulling a giant dollar out of the ogre's wallet] I got your wallet, man!
Ogre:  No! My big money! Give it back!
Finn:  Give me back my friend!
Ogre:  But I killed him already!
Finn:  [Crying] Fine. [Angry] I'll give you your dollar. [Yelling] Here's your dollaaaaaarrrrr!
Ogre:  Oof!
Jake:  Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa-oa!
Finn:  [Gliding on the dollar towards Jake] Jake! [Grabbing Jake with his feet] You're okay!
Jake:  [Laughingly] Stomachs are weird.
Jake:  Dude! You just flew us all the way to the top! Wait a minute. [Sniff] I can smell the book right through this door.
Ogre:  [Crying in the distance] You're under arrest for stealing my dollar! [Crying again]
Finn:  Just a minute, Jake.
Ogre:  Hey!
Jake:  You know what that was? That was righteous.
Finn:  Thanks, Jake. Now sniff out that book for me.
Jake:  You got it!
Finn:  Whoa!
Dark Magician:  Congratulations, Finn the human. You must be truly righteous to have made it this far.
Finn:  Thank you.
Dark Magician:  Now! Enter my brain-world, and I will show you some aspect of yourself that you're not entirely aware of.
Finn:  Where... am I?
Dark Magician:  [Disembodied voice] For your final trial, slay the beast!
Finn:  Why? Is it an evil beast?
Dark Magician:  Yeeeeessss. It's completely evil. Will you slay it?
Finn:  Shoot, yeah. I'll slay anything that's evil. That's my deal.
Dark Magician:  Yeeeeessss! You've done well, hero.
Finn:  Thank you.
Dark Magician:  Now! As one last, last trial... Slay this ant!
Finn:  Is it evil?
Dark Magician:  No! But it's not good either. It's, uh, neutral. Will you slay it?
Finn:  [Slamming his fist down next to the ant] No!
Dark Magician:  If you want the heroes' Enchiridion, then slay this unaligned ant!
Finn:  Never. Never. Never!
Dark Magician:  [Back in the real world] Uh oh.
Key-per:  [Dressed like a devil] Congratulations, Finn the human. Now you have truly reached...
Finn:  Never!
Key-per:  Ooh!
Finn:  Oh, no! Mr. Key-per! I-I'm sorry. Why are you wearing that little devil costume?
Key-per:  These are my pajamas. I was getting ready for bed.
Mannish Man:  [Running in] Finn... Jake... You made it!
Finn:  Are you another trial?
Mannish Man:  Trial? Oh, no! [Laughing] I'm Mannish Man, the minotaur.
Finn:  [Gasp] The manly minotaur from Princess Bubblegum's story!
Finn:  So, can I check out the Enchiridion? Can I? Can I? Can I?
Mannish Man:  Yeah. Come on. Let's go check it out. [Running off] Woohoo!
Mannish Man:  We've been watching you guys on our magical viewing globe. Take a seat guys, have some juice. There's grape and apple and the gatekeeper made spaghetti. And... Alright, Finn. Are you ready for this?
Finn:  The Enchiridion!
Mannish Man:  [Handing the book to Finn] You deserve it, Finn.
Finn:  Really?
Mannish Man:  Yeah, Finn. You're the goodest of heart and most righteous hero I've seen here. Tenderness, ingenuity, bravery, nard-kicking ability, and when you took that giant ogre's dollar... [Laughing] Oh, man! The Key-per nearly fainted!
Key-per:  It's true!
Jake:  [Laughing] Hey! Crack open that book and read something for fun's sake, alright?
Finn:  Oh, yeah. [Opens book] Whoa. How to Kiss Princesses? [Giggles]
Jake:  Whoa. What'd you just read?
Princess Bubblegum:  [Appearing on the magical viewing globe] Yeah. What does it say, Finn? Mannish Man won't tell me.
Mannish Man:  [Whispering to Finn] Hey. Don't tell her, Finn.
Finn:  It doesn't say anything, Princess.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Annoyed] Mannish man!
Finn:  [Leaping into the air] Awwww... Yeah!
