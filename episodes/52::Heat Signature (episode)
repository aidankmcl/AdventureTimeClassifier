Finn:  Man, I still can't believe Marceline is 1,000 years old and has never seen Heat Signature. This movie is gonna blow their minds.
Finn:  Marceline! We brought Heat Signature.
Marceline:  Woot! Woot!
Jake:  Woo!
Marceline:  Hey, so I want you all to meet Finn and Jake. They aren't... completely lame.
Finn:  Whatup?
Marceline:  Guys, this is Wendy...
Wendy:  Hey.
Marceline:  Booboo...
Booboo:  Hello. Hello.
Marceline:  ...and Georgy.
Georgy:  Hey.
Marceline:  We used to be in a gang together back in the underworld.
Finn:  Hmm. Yeah, that's pretty sweet. Hope y'all like getting your minds blown, cause it's showtime.
Finn:  [groans in pain] What is wrong with this couch?
Jake:  Ehh, that made my teeth hurt.
Marceline:  Oh yeah. Sorry, I don't ever really sit on there. I just float usually. We... kinda all do.
Finn:  Aww, what? man, no fair.
Marceline:  Yeah, well, too bad you're not vampires. So, anyways, I...
Finn:  Wait! Hold on just a second.
Finn:  Marceline, we insist you turn us into vampires. Or ghosts, or whatever. We just wanna fly.
Marceline:  All right, all right. Fine.
Finn and Jake:  Yes!
Wendy:  Come on, Marceline! you're gonna turn these goofballs?
Marceline:  [giggles] Don't worry, I've got something more fun in mind. [She whispers to the ghosts. Finn and Jake are exhausted from jumping up and down.]
Finn:  Okay, Marceline, we're ready now.
Marceline:  Okay, hold that thought. [She floats into the next room.]
Georgy:  Huhuuuhhuh...
Marceline:  I'm gonna perform the biting ritual. You guys close your eyes and don't open them until I say so. If you do... your heads will EXPLODE! Okay, Finn. You first.
Marceline:  Bite.
Marceline:  Chomp.
Marceline:  Boop boop. Boop. Boop. Okey dokey. All done. How do you guys feel?
Finn:  Pretty... much... the same.
Jake:  My neck sort of hurts.
Booboo:  Don't you feel a little hungry...for blood?
Finn:  [moaning] I felt it. Jake, do you feel it?
Jake:  Yeah, I could go for some blood.
Finn:  [gasps] Oh no. Jake. Now we're gonna have to drink blood for all eternity.
Jake:  [gasps] Yeah, what if we turn evil? I'll hafta start wearing cologne.
Marceline:  Relax, guys. You can satisfy your bloodlust without killing. Look. [She drains the red from the apple until it is pale.] You just eat the color. Here, Jake. You try. [She hands the other apple to Jake.]
Finn:  Ugh. Come on.
Jake:  Sorry, bro. [While Finn and Jake aren't looking, Marceline silently drains the red from the apple in Jake's hands. After Jake and Finn finish rubbing the mush off their faces, Jake looks down and notices the now-pale fruit.] Oh, snap! I feel... stronger. [Jake squeezes the pale apple between his hands.]
Finn:  Whooooa... Marceline, can we float now?
Marceline:  Mmm... Not yet. That's a really advanced power. First, you gotta go through vampire orientation.
Georgy:  Huhuuuhhuh...
Marceline:  Think you chumps can handle it?
Finn and Jake:  Oh, baby, yeah, baby, baby, baby, yeah, baby, yeah, yeah.
Marceline:  Okay, guys, the first phase of vampire orientation is learning... [Catches a firefly and puts it in her mouth.] ...invisibility. [She turns invisible. Finn reaches out to touch the firefly in her mouth and chuckles nervously]
Finn:  [nervous chuckle]
Marceline:  Ah! Hey! [She slaps Finn but catches him before he hits the ground. Marceline moves Finn around. She becomes visible once again.]
Marceline:  You ready for the power of...invisibility?
Finn:  With all my heart.
Marceline:  Good. Now, spin!
Marceline:  Give it a whirl, Jake! [Then she sends Jake spinning until he falls to the ground.] Now chant, "INVISIBLE!INVISIBLE!"
Finn and Jake:  INVISIBLE!INVISIBLE! [They spin to a stop. They get up groaning dizzily.]
Marceline:  Yup. It worked?
Finn and Jake:  [gasp]
Jake:  We're invisible! [He punches Finn in the stomach.]
Finn:  You're invisible! [He punches Jake in the stomach.]
Jake:  Hey. Then how come we can see each other?
Marceline:  Because you guys become vampires at the same time. So you are forever linked.
Finn and Jake:  AWW YEAH! [They do a stomach five, and spin around, laughing.]
Booboo:  [laughs] Marceline...you're friends with some real morons. [Georgy and Wendy grimace.]
Lumpy Space Princess:  Oh, my glob, Melissa. Ever since Clara stopped eating meat, her skin looks so good. I mean, she still looks fat, but like, I can't say that junk to her face.
Jake:  Wow! LSP's a hobo!
Finn:  Let's mess with her.
Lumpy Space Princess:  I'm doing so awesome on my own. Like, right now, I found this can of beans.
Lumpy Space Princess:  Finn? Jake! Put down my stuff!
Finn:  [gasps] She knows it's us.
Jake:  She must recognize our voices.
Finn:  Let's disguise them. [Romanian accent] We're invisible!
Lumpy Space Princess:  Melissa, I have to go. They got into my toilet paper. Melissa, I have to go! [hangs up]
Lumpy Space Princess:  Give it back, you guys!
Jake:  Weeeee!
Finn:  Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, Jake!
Lumpy Space Princess:  [in slow motion] Nooooooooo!
Lumpy Space Princess:  MY BEANS!!! [Angrily, she hits Finn and Jake. Georgy, Wendy, and Booboo laugh at the sight.]
Booboo:  Time to join in on the fun!
Lumpy Space Princess:  You guys ruined everything! I'm gonna kill you!
Finn:  But we're undead. [An axe suddenly appears to float in midair. LSP suddenly gasps and faints at the sight.]
Jake:  Geez, we really scared her.
Marceline:  Nice vampire scare, guys.
Finn:  Thanks.
Booboo:  Yeah, pretty good, fellas. [The ghosts chuckle.] You guys ready...for the next vampire lesson? [They all stick out what would be a foot. Marceline stares.]
Finn:  You know we are.
Booboo:  Good. [The ghosts all start kicking Finn and Jake.]
Finn:  Ow! What's the point of this lesson?
Georgy:  Kick 'em harder! [They do so. Bruises appear on Finn and Jake as they yelp in pain.]
Finn:  Ow! It hurts!
Jake:  Ohhh!
Marceline:  Okay, everyone! Stop the toughness lesson!
Georgy:  What?
Marceline:  Finn, Jake. You guys okay?
Finn:  We're okay. [coughs] It's all worth it.
Georgy:  See? They're fine.
Wendy:  When did you go all soft? You used to like teaching people about kicks. [Marceline stares.]
Georgy:  Hey, guys, I think you're ready to learn how to float. All you have to do is jump off that ledge. [He glances up towards some derelict structures in the distance.]
Finn:  Cool.
Marceline:  [gasps] W-wait! There's more beginner lessons you need to learn before floating. Like... uh... the spooky vampire walk. See? Spoooooky... wooo!
Finn:  Heh heh. No way.
Jake:  We wanna fly!
Marceline:  You guys stop right now.
Georgy:  Marceline, chill out. It's going to be okay. We've got a plan. [to Finn and Jake] Now, get in your flying positions. [Georgy pushes them off the edge.]
Finn and Jake:  VAMPIRES FOREVER!!! WOOO!
Marceline:  What are you guys waiting for? You said you had a plan.
Wendy:  We do. It's to let them die! [The ghosts start laughing.]
Finn and Jake:  We did it! Yeah! Woohoo! Awesome!
Wendy:  Way to go, Marceline.
Marceline:  Hey, you guys need to stop trying to kill my friends!
Booboo:  They gotta die someday.
Wendy:  Hey! Let's invite them to our place! When they show up...
Wendy, Booboo and Georgy:  We'll suck their guts out through their brains!
Finn:  Did you see us?
Wendy:  Yeah, you guys were pretty amazing.
Booboo:  Hey, we're gonna throw a party... in honor of your new vampire skills.
Finn:  Holy snaps, that's awesome!
Marceline:  They're lying to you guys. They just wanna suck the guts out of the top of your head.
Finn, Jake, and ghosts:  What?
Booboo:  She's just jealous of you.
Wendy:  We'll see you at midnight at our place. [The ghosts turn invisible. Finn and Jake turn toward Marceline.]
Marceline:  Guys, promise me you're going to that party.
Finn:  We're not gonna go.
Marceline:  You're not?
Finn:  Nah. I'm kinda tired from doing vampire stuff all day. We're just gonna chill.
Marceline:  Oh. Okay.
Finn:  Well, we're going back home.
Jake:  Peace.
Finn:  Number 25, Blood Drive. [Finn and Jake enter the mansion.] Hey guys, we're here! Wow! Look at you guys! That's awesome!
Finn:  Uh... [He shrieks in horror as one of the ghosts puts a mouth on his head. Jake tries to punch the ghosts' mouths away, but one gets him from behind.] Georgy, what's wrong? Jake, what's happening?
Jake:  I think they're testing our vampire abilities.
Finn:  Oh, sweet. VAMPIRE KICK! [Finn leaps in the air, but gets knocked away and lands on top of the chandelier.]
Georgy:  Aw, come on. Will you knock it off already?
Wendy:  You know you're not even real vampires.
Finn:  Pssh. Then why am I flying, Wendy? [realizes] Oh. [The chandelier breaks loose. finn falls screaming to the floor.] Yo, man. I think Marceline tricked us.
Jake:  Yeah.
Marceline:  VAMPIRE KICK!!! [She kicks the ghosts' mouths away.] Finn. Jake. I'm so sorry I got you into this. I should've never pranked you so perfectly.
Finn:  It's okay. You're here now to beat up those ghosts and save us.
Marceline:  Oh, no, vampires can't beat ghosts. It's sort of a Rock-Paper-Scissors thing. I just came to apologize.
Finn:  Aw, man. [The ghosts' mouths pick up Jake and Finn and start sucking on their heads.] I can't believe we're gonna die just because we wanted to be comfortable watching Heat Signature. [Suddenly, the ghosts drop Finn.]
Georgy:  Uh... did you guys say... Heat Signature?
Commander:  Have you located the enemy's heat signature, Private?
Private:  Yes, sir. But I also noticed something... strange. Something... I can't explain.
Commander:  Well, spit it out, man!
Private:  I... I... I can't seem to locate... our heat signature.
Finn:  [groans in frustration] This stink-ups mega bam-bam to the J-stop. Could we just go back to the brain-eating or whatever?
Georgy:  MMM-HMM. After the movie.
Finn:  Well, can't we just--
Marceline and ghosts:  Shhh!
Georgy:  Shut!
Private:  [off screen] Look out, Commander!
Commander:  [off screen] Aaaagh! My heat signature!
