Neptr: BMO, when is something going to happen?
BMO: Shh. Just watch. It happens once a monthI promise.
Jake: [yawns]
BMO: [pointing] This is it!
Neptr: Oooooh.
Neptr: But where does it go?
BMO: That's none of our business.
Bug: Tickets! Get your tickets here! See the world's greatest tiny circus! Witness the amazing wood-eating termite! The mighty strong-ant!
Ringmaster: You're late, Blue Nose! Get into makeup!
Audience: [cheers and applauds]
Audience member: [laughs mockingly]
Audience: [boos and hisses]
Male audience member: You stink!
Young girl in audience: [cries]
Ringmaster: [to Blue Nose] Too much artsy, not enough fartsy. We talked about this, clown! [to audience] Heh-heh, wasn't that something? Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, you're perfectly safe. But at this time, I'd like to ask anyone with a medical condition to please leave the premises at once. What you're about to witness with your own eyes may shock and astound you to your very core.
Ringmaster: Tonight, I give you the wildest, most dangerous beast anywhere in captivity! The horrible, the stupendous... [cracks whip] Goralina!
Ringmaster: [cracking whip] [laughs] Attagirl!
Dad bug: [to son] Don't worry, Junior. It's all part of the act.
Ringmaster: Blue Nose! Boy, am I glad to see you. Come in, come in! Sit down. You did good out there tonight with the belly-dancing routine. Real good. Aw, don't give me that look. I know we said we were going to let the chipmunk go at the end of last season, but Goralina is our big draw. You understand that.
Ringmaster: We're barely breaking even herewhat do you want from me?! Look, there's another show in an hour. You come up with an act that can rival Goralina, then we can talk. But look what she got us last night: three whole pennies. Think you can make me this kind of cash? You do that, I won't need the chipmunk anymore. I'll let her go, just like I promised. But you're gonna have to lose the fancy-schmancy stuff and [pounds table] give the people what they want! Get it?!
Audience: [laughs]
Ringmaster: [pleased] The old Blue Nose magic.
Audience: [laughs]
Audience: [laughs]
Dad bug: [to son] Aren't you glad we came back for the second show?
Audience: [laughs, cheers, and applauds] [throws pennies into the arena]
Ringmaster: Oho! You were great, kid! That's what I'm talking about. With you and the chipmunk in the show, we're gonna have a real one-two punch!
Ringmaster: Hey... I know what I said, but I want to see how many boxcars this gravy train has on it.
Ringmaster: Look at her. It's like looking at a big, sad dollar sign.
Ringmaster: [gasps]
Ringmaster: Yipe!
Audience: [laughs, cheers, applauds]
Ringmaster: Whoa-ho!
Strongman: [laughs] [sees Blues Nose coming for him] Oh!
Audience: [laughs]
Ringmaster: That's right. Lift with your legs first, then put your back into it.
Ringmaster: There he is. Gotcha! Thought you could skip out, eh? and start your own circus!
Strongman: Yeah, you! You and your corny clown hat! [takes off Blue Nose's hat and rubs it in his face, turning the frown upside down]
Other performer: Hey, he's smiling! [slaps Blue Nose]
Strongman: [slaps him] What's so funny?
Other performer: You rat! [slaps him]
Strongman: [slaps him] You creep! What's the big joke?
Audience: [gasps and murmurs]
BMO: [laughs]
Neptr: Ha ha! Neat!
