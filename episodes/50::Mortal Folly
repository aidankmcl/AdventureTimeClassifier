Jake:  Ommmmm... [Whispering]
Finn:  [Whispering] Jake! What am I supposed to be meditatin' about?
Jake:  [Whispering] Don't know. I'm thinking of pillows stuffed with spaghetti.
Princess Bubblegum:  Clear your minds.
Princess Bubblegum: [stands up] I have to go check on something!
Finn:  Can we go with?
Princess Bubblegum:  ...Perhaps you are ready to go with. [Finn and Jake bump fists.] Guys, you'll need to put these on. [To Finn] Pull back your hat.
Jake:  Neat!
Princess Bubblegum:  Stay close to me. [She claps nine times (the specific rhythm is "1 &-a 2 & 3 & 4 &"). Peppermint Butler appears and blows a huge bubble which engulfs the trio.]
Finn:  Whoa!
Princess Bubblegum:  At the heart of this tree is an ancient evil, held in a prison of amber--the Lich.
Finn:  What's that sound?
Princess Bubblegum:  He's casting spells--trying to get in your head and control your bod... but these gems are protecting our minds from his influence. If we lost the gems, we'd be defenseless. [The snail comes out of Finn's pack.] He would have full control over us.
Finn:  That's freakin' nuts!
Princess Bubblegum:  Beyond Iceberg Lake lies the ruins of the Lich's tower, where he was converting the planet's life force into unholy power to destroy all of Ooo... but before he could, the Legendary Billy attacked him and pummeled him into the resin of this tree. [The snail, who has reached the Lich, bangs his head against the amber, cracking it. The Lich converts his body to dark energy and escapes through the crack.] I--WHAT THE NUTS?!
Finn:  Dude, be a big sword!
Jake:  Oh, okay! I'll try!
Princess Bubblegum:  [Gasps] Quickly! To the other secret room! [The three arrive there.] There's only one known weapon that can harm the Lich. [She opens a cabinet with a key revealing said weapon.] The Gauntlet of the Hero.
Voice:  BIIILLYYYYYYY!!!
Jake:  Billy's big ol' beef fingers!
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn, you have but one chance. While the Lich isn't at full power, you must smite him with this gauntlet! [Finn equips the gauntlet. It becomes smaller to fit Finn's hand.] His only desire... is to destroy life. [Whispering] [Picks up crystal ball which shows an image of the Lich standing in a large fire.] If you fail... he'll kill everyone.
Finn:  No. That will not happen.
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, and there's something else that I want you to have. The Lich's lair is supposed to be cold. ...I just don't want you to get sick. [She holds up a pink sweater.] Take this sweater. I made it myself. [Jake sniffs at the sweater.] I'm not great at knitting, but please wear it. I care about you, Finn.
Finn:  I love it.
Jake:  Me, too!
Ice King:  [Appearing in window]  Hey hey hey! [The three scowl.] So... I've been thinking about this a lot lately and, well, uh... phew, gosh, I'm so nervous... Finn, and Jake, will you give me your blessings so I can marry Princess Bubblegum?
Jake:  What is wrong with you?!
Ice King:  [In disbelief] What's wrong with me?! [Jake closes the window.] No! [Jake latches it.] Not the latch!
Princess Bubblegum:  Quickly now, Finn! Track the Lich by his trail of death.
Finn:  Here I go!
Jake:  Here I go!
Princess Bubblegum:  Be safe!
Jake:  This is our first fate-of-the-world deal!
Finn:  Yeah, man! We gotta shut this fool down hardcore!
Jake:  Running this fast makes my stomach hurt!
Finn:  Run through it, man! [The Ice King appears in front of Finn] We gotta get beyond Iceberg Lake before the Lich!
Ice King:  Oh, my! How clumsy of me!
Finn:  What the heck, Ice King?!
Ice King:  Hey, wait, you guys! I'm serious about Bubblegum! Look, I wrote her name all over my arms and legs! [He shows them evidence to this.]
Finn and Jake:  Yugh!
Ice King:  Guys! It's not fair! She always hangs out with you, and it's not like you wanna marry her!
Finn:  [Blushing] Why are you following us?! [Throws a rock at him]
Ice King:  Whoa! [Dodges it] I told you already. I want your blessings so I can marry Princess Bubblegum! [They keep running. Ice King uses his ice magic to block their path with ice.] Come on, guys, give me permission to marry her! I'll... I'll do a little dance for you! [Dances] Hmm? You like this?
Finn:  No!
Ice King:  [In desperation] Oh, come on! If you bless our wedding, then maybe she'll really love me.
Finn:  [Fed up, pointing the gauntlet at him] Ice King, go away, man.
Ice King:  I will! When you bless our wedding!
Finn:  No thanks, guy. Hmm? How does this gauntlet [Banging on gauntlet] work?!
Jake:  Whoa!
Finn:  I can't turn it off!
Jake:  Punch it in the eye!
Finn:  Phew!
Jake:  Let's blow this stand!
Ice King:  [To himself] I tried to do this right, but you've driven me to this--driven me to bad doing.
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, Finn and Jake, please be okay. [Stress-eating a Candy Person] Please be okay... please be okay...
Ice King:  Eh... stupid thing... come on... eh...
Princess Bubblegum:  Ice King?! Get outta here!!
Ice King:  I didn't want to do this, but by not blessing our wedding, Finn and Jake have forced me to kidnap you.
Princess Bubblegum:  That's insane!
Ice King:  I know! But I'll show them... I'll show them how they've hurt us!
Princess Bubblegum:  [Leaving with him] NO!!
Jake:  There! Out over the lake!
Finn:  After his butt!
Jake:  [Turning into a boat] I'm your dingy dog!
Finn:  Here! I'll help paddle! [To gauntlet] Hey. It's me. [The gauntlet looks at Finn for just a second.] Aw, come on. I'm sorry I punched you in the ball.
Jake:  Waaaah!
Finn:  Ah, yeah, haha! Closing in... Gonna get you, man! [Readying gauntlet] Closer, Jake! [They get nearer and nearer to the Lich.] Closer... closer...
Ice King:  Ah!
Finn:  PRINCESS?! NO!
Ice King:  Oh, no. [Water falls on him and Princess Bubblegum.] Oh, gross. This water stinks.
Finn:  [He's had it.] ICE KING!!
Ice King:  Look! Look what you've made me do to her!
Princess Bubblegum:  Guys! Don't let the Lich reach his well of power! [A green explosion of energy occurs far off.] [In terror] Oh, no!! He's made it!!
Finn:  Don't worry, Princess!
Ice King:  Hey, where're you guys goin'? What's goin' on?
Finn:  I don't have time for this!
Jake:  Then let's go!
Finn:  My pack!!
Jake:  [Latching onto Finn like a backpack] It's okay!
Ice King:  [To Princess Bubblegum] Man... I-I wanna go after them, but... that hole looks scary, doesn't it? [Beat] Well! Holes are holes! [Enters with her]
Finn:  The Lich!
Jake:  [Whispering] He's gettin' his powers back! Weird!
Finn:  No! [He fires a blast at the Lich, who dodges it. Finn and Jake heroically go down to him, Jake shaping his ears into a wing shape.] Prepare thyself... to get smote in the name of Bubblegum!!
The Lich:  [Raising a bony finger to what was his lips.] Shhhh...
Ice King:  [Entering with Princess Bubblegum] Yep! Holes are holes! NYEH!! [He notices the Lich, who fires a green fire ball at the heroes.]
Jake:  Look out!! [Finn ducks out of the way.] That's it! I'm gonna bark 'im!
The Lich:  Finn...
Finn:  Oh, no.
The Lich:  Finn... [Finn turns] Come...
Finn:  [Finn grabs his head.] STOP!!! 
The Lich:  Aren't you cold... Finn...? [Finn goes forward.] Walk into the well... Finn... Aren't you cold...?
Finn:  NO, I'M NOT!! I'VE GOT A SWEATER ON!!
The Lich:  You are a joke to me!! [Fires green fire at Finn]
Finn:  [In realization] This sweater... It's keeping me safe!
Princess Bubblegum's voice [In Finn's head]:  I care about you, Finn...
Finn:  This is it. The ultimate weapon against evil--the power of... l-l-l-l...llliking someone a lot. [Sobers up, growls, and takes off the sweater] LICH!!!
Jake:  Finn!! Buddy!!
Finn:  [Groans] Jake? [Looks around] Jake!
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, Finn... you did it!
Ice King:  We did? Hey, yeah, we did it!! Oh, you guys! This experience has brought us all so much closer together! Princess, I'm sorry for all of this. I love you, and I've decided to set you free. [Makes the cuffs disappear] Go free!!
Ice King:  Uh... Whoops, I've got the dropsies!
