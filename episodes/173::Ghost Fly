BMO: Kya! Kya! [reading karate magazine] Hmm.
[The magazine reads, "How to stop a man's heart with karate: 1. 'Focus chi' and 2. 'Stop a man's heart'" with diagrams depicting each action.]
BMO: Ohhh, that's pretty good. Kya! [punches a hole in the punchbag pillow]
Jake: [covers ears] BMO... keep it down!
BMO: But you said 8:00 to 10:00 is my time to do karate. It's my karate time!
Jake: I know, but I got a headache, and I'm in a funky mood.
Finn: What's wrong, dude?
Jake: I don't know. I think I got restless leg syndrome.
Finn: Is that from getting chubby?
Jake: What? No, man, it's just restless leg.
Finn: Oop! My bad.
Jake: What are you reading?
Finn: This old copy of Adventure Boy magazinethe only magazine for boy adventurers. This kid Rusty is getting chased down the river by three grown otters. This magazine rules! But I'm saving the end for tomorrow. [closes magazine]
Jake: Cool.
Finn: Well, I hope your leg feels better. I'm turning in. I'll see you up there.
Jake: [blows raspberry]
BMO: [sing-song] Jake...
Jake: No, BMO.
BMO: KYA! [punches pillow]
Jake: [screams] No, BMO! No more! [walking into kitchen] Maybe some soup will take the edge off.
Jake: Ew! Gross! Nasty! [smacks it with a flyswatter] Hyah!
Jake: I'm sorry you were born a fly and I had to kill you, you disgusting, disgusting creature.
BMO: Kya! Kya! Kya!
Jake: BMO, PLEASE!
Jake: [yawns, smacks lips]
Jake: [sits up] Finn, was that you?
Finn: [snores]
Jake: [lies back down] Probably just BMO or something.
Jake: That's weird. BMO doesn't like 30's jazz. [climbs downstairs] Yeesh. Creepy. [takes the needle off the record]
Jake: [gasps] [fearfully] I didn't know we had one of those.
Voice: [spookily] Oooooo...
Jake: [panting] Hey, hey. Hey, who?
Jake: Aah!
Ghost Fly: Ooooooo...
Jake: Hey! I killed you!
Jake: Aah! [tries waving it away, then runs] Aah! Ghost fly touching me! [climbs upstairs] Finn! Finn!
Finn: [jerks awake] Aah!
Jake: Ghost fly, man! Aah! Aah!
Finn: Okay.
Jake: Come on, man. Let's get out of the house. It's a ghost fly!
Finn: So what?
Jake: No, man, ghost flies are filthy! They carry diseases, such as tuberculosis, polio, dysentery. They leave those little fly doodies on your soul.
Jake: Aah!
BMO: Finn, Jake! What's wrong?!
Finn & Jake: Ghost fly!
BMO: [screams]
Jake: [sighs] Thank goodness we lost him. He's gone.
Ghost Fly: Whoo. [swishes scythe]
Jake: [screams]
BMO: Run! Just run!
Finn: Ay-ay-ay-ay!
BMO: Hmm. [punching] Kya! Kya!
Jake: We should ask what its unfinished business is. Ghosts always have unfinished business.
Finn: Ghost fly, what's your problem?!
Finn: Come on, dude. Tell us your unfinished business!
Finn: Aah! It's no good. He's a tortured little spirit. We need help to communicate with this ghost fly.
Jake: Nah, man, let's just get someone to banish itsomeone with serious paranormal juice. [dials phone]
BMO: Is he coming soon?
Jake: I think so. His ways are kind of mysterious.
Finn: That's cool.
Finn, Jake & BMO: [scream]
Ghost Fly: Woo?
Peppermint Butler: Let's get this ritual rolling. I got stuff to do.
Ghost Fly: Woo! [swipes at Peppermint Butler]
Peppermint Butler: Hey! No! Unclean demon, feel the sting of holy water! [throws water at the ghost fly]
Jake: [quietly] Thank you.
Peppermint Butler: [drawing chalk circles around Finn, Jake, and BMO] These circles will protect you from the ghost's attacks while I prepare the banishing ritual. Worry not, fellow believers, for in this bag, I possess all the darkest and most powerful tools of magic ever to be assembled in one place. We're perfectly safeas long as... [the ghost fly picks up the bag] we... have...
Jake: Well, huh. How about that? No biggie. We'll just hang out inside these magic circles until morning. That's when ghosts go to sleep. Yep. Just got to make it... till morning.
Ghost Fly: Woo! [flies offscreen]
Finn: Hmm?
Finn: [gasps] The end of my story. And it's so close.
Jake: Don't do it, bro. It's a trap.
Finn: I know. It's an obvi trap. But wait. What if... watch this. Ha! [grabs chalk and draws a bigger circle] Mm?
Jake: Dude, what are you?
Finn: If I extend the circle... [erases old circle] farther... I can get closer to the magazine.
BMO: Theoretically, that is possible.
Jake: Yeah, but I'm still getting a "woo-jah" feeling. This seems like a bad idea.
Finn: Just have to stay inside this circle.
Finn: Ha ha! How'd you do it, Rusty? How'd you shake them otters? [picks up magazine] [laughs] Man, what a great ending! [laughs again, but suddenly starts gagging]
Jake: Finn? What's wrong, buddy?
Finn: [breathing strangely] [turns around, revealing he has transformed into a fly]
Jake & BMO: [scream]
Jake: Oh, Finn, you're disgusting!
Jake: Aw, that's it! I've had it with this ghost fly! I wish I were a ghost so I could punch him with my ghost fist!
BMO: Jake, I have a radical option. I've been studying a karate move that could temporarily stop your heart long enough for you to fight the ghost on his own plane of existence.
Jake: What?
BMO: It's okay! I learned it out of a magazine.
Jake: [looks at Finn crawling on the ceiling] Finn... [to BMO] All right. But first you got to give me some unfinished business so I can come back as a ghost.
BMO: Tell me a joke.
Jake: Okay. What do you call a bear that only attacks guys named Paul?
BMO: Kya! [punches Jake]
Jake: [choking] [becomes pale and falls backwards]
BMO: I killed Jake! Yay, BMO!
Ghost Jake: Whoa! BMO, you killed me. Whoa. Wow. Wow! [disappears]
BMO: Jake! I can't hear you! I will start your heart up in five minutes, okay? [holds up fingers] This many!
Jake: Okay. Five minutes. Whoa.
Jake: Is this some kind of low-level dead world? That's a bummer.
Jake: Aah!
Jake: Aah! Oh, stuff! Aah!
Jake: Ohh! Ohh! Get away! [throws a ghost cat at the ghost fly]
Jake: Aah! You killed it! Aah!
Jake: Aah! Aah! Get away!
Jake: [screams]
Jake: [screams]
Ghost Soup: Oooooo...
Ghost Fly: [stops] Hmm?
Ghost Soup: Hoooooo!
Jake: That's right. You never finished the soup. That's your unfinished business!
Ghost Fly: [nodding] Woo-woo.
Jake: And now that you've finished it, you get to ascend to a glorious, new peaceful realm.
Jake: [in awe] Ahhh. Bam! [slaps the fly to the floor, making it disappear in a cloud of smoke] Shouldn't have tried to kill me, son! [blows at smoke] Yes! [starts ascending and glowing] What's happening? Oh, BMO must be bringing me back! Yes! Yeah, BMO!
Jake: Mm. BMO?
Finn: Jake, I missed you, bro!
BMO: Jake!
Finn: Don't ever leave me again!
Jake: Good job, BMO! You brought me back.
BMO: [weakly] Yes. Yay, BMO. BMO is so good.
Doctor Princess: Whew!
