Finn:  Just about done.
Jake:  Mm, oh boy.
Finn:  How much Softy Cheesy for ya deezy? A little? A lot?
Jake:  Blech! None!
Finn:  But you used to love Softy Cheese!
Jake:  I don't wanna talk about it.
Finn:  What was that?
Jake:  Probably an owl. [Takes a bite of his hot dog] Mm... Mm, mm... [Spits out his food] A ghost!!
Finn:  Dude. It's just Ghost Princess. Hey, GP. [She howls.] [Whispering to Jake] She's weird, huh? [Ghost Princess gets closer to Finn and howls again.] How's it goin'?
Jake:  Are you haunting us?
Ghost Princess:  Yeeeeessss...
Jake:  Oh, okay.
Finn:  [Tactfully] Well, could ya knock it off??
Ghost Princess:  Sorry... It's just... I'm doomed to haunt this mortal plane...
Jake:  Oh. Well, let's hear more about that, honey.
Ghost Princess:  Until I discover the cause of my death, my soul can't ascend to the 50th Dead World. But as a ghost, I have no memory of my mortal life... and no idea how I died...
Finn:  [Gasps] It's a crime case!
Jake:  Whoa, step back, nephew. We don't know she was moidered!
Finn:  That's right. We don't even know how she was moida'd, but I'm the hard-boiled sleuth who's gonna crack your case wiiiide open!
Ghost Princess:  OH! That sounds wonderful!
Ghost Princess:  This way, gentlemen!
Jake:  Whoa. Your neighborhood is... uh... very peaceful.
Ghost Princess:  It's the cradle of my despair...
Jake:  [Awkwardly] Right, right.
Ghost Princess:  Well... here's me.
Finn:  Our first clue! [Reading grave] "Female." It's a good start, but we need more. Jake, it's time to interrogate the neighbors. We'll do it good cop bad cop style. I CALL BAD COP!
Jake:  Awww...
Finn:  Yo, ghost! Yo, yo! Yo, wake up, fool! Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
Boilbee:  What?!?!
Finn:  Yo, ghost, whaddaya know about the lady buried next to you?
Boilbee:  What, you mean her? [Pointing at Ghost Princess] She's been here longer than almost anybody!
Ghost Princess:  He's right...! [Starts crying]
Boilbee:  And don't think I don't see what you do, Ghost Princess.
Ghost Princess:  What...?
Boilbee:  Sneakin' off at night, scarin' peeps, hauntin' at all hours... 'cause you can't deal with your issues!
Clarence:  Leave her be, Boilbee.
Boilbee:  Whaaat?
Clarence:  A princess deserves empathy, not your sass. [Throws another cheese puff at him]
Boilbee:  Nyeee... nyeee... Butt out, Clarence!
Clarence:  Some of us still want to feel, you know? The vital... [Eats another cheese puff] ...magnetism of life. [Ghost Princess stares in amazement.] The vibrating energies that connect all living and... nonliving beings.
Boilbee:  Nyaaargh! I don't like your words! Arrrgh... [Sinks back in the ground]
Ghost Princess:  [To Clarence] I'm Ghost Princess. Have we met before? I feel like we have.
Clarence:  I don't think so, m'lady, but I am honored.
Finn:  Whadda you know about Ghosty-pees gettin' murdle-lurdled?
Clarence:  Sorry, I don't know anything. I can't imagine anyone who would harm someone as beautiful as this. [Kisses her hand]
Jake:  Whoa. Smooth.
Clarence:  Did you try looking yonder? [Points away] That's where the ne'er-do-well ghosts hang out.
Finn:  Right... Ne'er-do-wellers. Let's do this, Jake.
Jake:  [To Ghost Princess and Clarence, running off with Finn] You stay, and eat cheese puffs!
Finn:  Geez. Look at this place. It's all bunked up.
Jake:  Yeah, no wonder this is where the ne'er-do-wells go when they deezy. I got a feelin' these ghosts are gonna be harder to shake than Boilbee.
Finn:  Yeah, well get ready, 'cause this biz is gonna get ridonk.
Jake:  Cool, man. Hey, can I be bad cop now?
Finn:  No. Okay, let's check this guy out.
Jake:  What's it say?
Finn:  [Reading grave] "Some donkus." WAKE UP, DONKUS! WE GOT QUESTIONS! DINGUS! TIME TO SING, YA CANARY! [Digs into the grave while grunting; opens coffin] BAM!! YAH! [Grabs body] What'chu know about Ghost Princess, huh?! Give it up, Dungus!
Jake:  Hey, man, take it easy.
Finn:  [Slaps Jake's hand off] You do your job, I do mine! [To body, in a low growling voice] TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW, PUNK!! Uh-oh. [Picks up broken dagger] What's this? A busted knife. Is this your knife, bro? TELL ME!!! [To Jake, whispering] Jake, good cop...
Jake:  Alright. Cool off, bad cop! [Pulls Finn back] This ghost ain't home, man!
Finn:  [Pants heavily] Well, you're lucky my partner's here... pal.
Jake:  He's not worth it, man.
Finn:  [Grunts] These ghosts think I'm playin'. They think it's all a big game. But you know what? You know what I'm gonna do?
Jake:  What?
Finn:  I'm gonna turn this game... UP-SIDE-DOWN!!! [His voice echoes.]
Ghost Princess:  So, you really don't know how you died either?
Clarence:  Of course not. [To ticket vendor] Two, please. [To Ghost Princess] And we might never find out, but that's okay because right now, in this moment, I'm feeling pretty sweetles, you know?
Ghost Princess:  I feel... sweetles also in this moment also.
Clarence:  That's great, Ghost Princess. I'm glad we can feel this way together, in the face of uncertainty.
Ghost Announcer:  Llllladies and gents! The center for Ghost Community Outreach and ghostdates.com present... SPIRIT WAVES!
Clarence:  More beautiful than I could imagine.
Ghost Princess:  Are you talking about Spirit Waves...?
Clarence:  I'm talking... about you, Princess.
Finn:  YYYYAAAAAH!! [Rapidly batters a fryer basket with a stick then breaks a pole by kicking it] GHOSTS! YOU GHOSTS! COME OUT! [Throws the stick at what looks like a tree then starts running around panting]
Jake:  I think this place is abandoned, man.
Finn:  They're just hidin' 'cause they know they're guilty!
Muscular Ghost 1:  Yo! Yo! That's my grave! Why're you fops trashin' our spot?!
Finn:  [Nervously] We thought you were... hiding.
Muscular Ghost 2:  Dude. We were at the Spirit Waves show.
Muscular Ghost 3:  Kill these fools!
Finn:  BRING IT ON, YOU MAMAS!
Clarence:  Hold up! These guys are with me.
Muscular Ghost 3:  ...A'ight, Clarence, but only because of that one time when I did that thing by accident and you were cool about it.
Muscular Ghost 1:  It's your lucky day, punks.
Jake:  Phew! Thanks, Clarence!
Finn:  Yo, I'm sorry we haven't solved the case yet.
Ghost Princess:  It's alright, Finn... I'm calling off the investigation.
Finn:  What? Why?
Ghost Princess:  I don't feel tormented anymore now that I'm with Clarence.
Finn:  Oh. That's... that's cool.
Ghost Princess:  It's hard to explain, but it's like we already know each other.
Clarence:  I feel it, too. Our spirits must be intwined in the cosmic wheel of time.
Jake:  Nice!
Clarence:  Let's go to my private mausoleum where we can be... private. [Exits with Ghost Princess]
Finn:  Yugh!
Ghost Princess:  [To Finn, exiting] Thanks for your help...!
Finn:  A'ight. [Sighs] [Scene cut; Finn and Jake are walking out of the cemetery] Man... I wanted to crack the case, y'know?
Jake:  Look on the bright side, guy! We looted all this sweet grave booty! Ka-ching! [Drops a variety of treasures]
Finn:  Jake! You looted?! That's bad, man! You're supposed to be good cop.
Jake:  Oops... I didn't know it was wrong.
Finn:  Come on, let's put all this stuff back.
Jake:  What?! All of it?!
Finn:  Yes, Jake. [Wipes dust off broken dagger] Huh. This dagger says, "Rence."
Jake:  What's that?
Finn:  I guess some donkus's real name was... [In realization] ReeeeEEEENCE?!!
Ghost Princess [In flashback]:  Have we met before?
Ghost Princess [In flashback]:  It's hard to explain, but it's like we already know each other.
Finn [In flashback]:  Is this your knife, bro?
Jake [In flashback]:  This ghost ain't home, man.
Jake:  What is it, dude??
Finn:  [Low, growling voice] ...We gotta dig up the princess.
Finn:  Look! [Pointing at a piece of a blade stuck in Ghost Princess's physical body; he pulls it out] Sorry. [To Jake] Lookit! [Puts dagger pieces together; the name "CLARENCE" is formed] "Cla-rence." Clarence was some donkus!
Jake:  Some donkus skee-bopped Ghost Princess!!
Jake:  STOP!
Finn:  Clarence is your murdler!
Clarence:  Warrior Princess! Give up your kingdom!
Warrior Princess:  Never! Not even to you, my love!! [They run into each other - Clarence blocks Warrior Princess' spear attack and plunges his sword deep into her with a sickening stabbing sound.] Aaagh... [Takes off her helmet, barely clinging to life] Clarence... I--... [Exhales as she dies]
Clarence:  My love... [Sobbing] NOOOOOO!!! [With his only love now slain by his blade, Clarence continues weeping as Warrior Princess' soul leaves her now-useless husk of a body behind]
Clarence:  I... did it?
Ghost Princess:  I forgive you, Clarence! Take my hands! Ascend with me to the 50th Dead Wooorld...!
Clarence:  I can't! My soul is stuck! I have to know how I died! Oh, Glob... My life is like a fart.
Jake:  Whoa, wait a minute. Say that again!
Clarence:  MY LIFE IS LIKE A FART!!!
Jake:  I know you, man! From the Squeez-E-Mart!
Clarence:  Huh? Uh... Squeez-E-Mart? I'm starting to remember! [Eyes light up and flashback begins at the Squeez-E-Mart.] [Voice over] I was a broken man.
Clarence [In flashback]:  More.
Tonya:  Think you've had enough, man.
Clarence [In flashback]:  I don't care. My life is like a fart.
Jake [In flashback]:  Huh?
Clarence [In flashback]:  [Walks over to the Softy Cheese dispenser] My life is like a fart! [Drinks Softy Cheese from the dispenser]
Tonya:  HEY! HEY, STOP THAT!
Jake [In flashback]:  CITIZEN'S ARREST! [Clarence ignores him and bloats up.] Hey, be careful, man!!
Finn:  So that's why you don't like Softy Cheese!
Ghost Princess:  Claaareeence!!!
Clarence:  Ghost Princess!!!
Jake:  Congratulations, you kids!
Finn:  Haha, yeah!
Ghost Princess:  [To Finn and Jake] Goodbyyye...! Thanks for everything!
Clarence:  [To Finn and Jake] Thanks for everything! Goodbye!
Finn:  You sure you're ready for this, man?
Jake:  Yeah. Gimme one a' them cheesy dogs, man.
Finn:  All gone? [Jake nods.] Lemme see. Move your tongue left...
Jake:  [Moving his tongue left] Wah-vah.
Finn:  ...And right.
Jake:  [Moving his tongue right] Vah.
Finn:  I'm proud of you, pal. Real proud.
