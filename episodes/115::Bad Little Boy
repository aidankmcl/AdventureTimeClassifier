Doctor Prince:  Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!
Fionna:  Fire the laser cannon!
Doctor Prince:  Ah!
Cake:  Good job, girl! Have some spaghetti!
Fionna:  [Muffled] Thanks!
Doctor Prince:  Ha! Too bad I'm a really strong guy and I took my doctor pills this morning! Lasers don't hurt me!
Dolphin:  Next time...
Fionna and Cake:  Give us the Enchiridion!
Doctor Prince:  Ooh ooh ooh! [Imitates monkey sounds, and throws them the book]
Fionna:  [Pleasantly surprised] Thanks... 
Cake:  That's not a book! It's a bomb!
Ice King:  You've been acting like a real knucklehead, Doctor Prince. Go on, get out of here! And don't ever do wrong things again!
Doctor Prince:  ...You're right. I see your side of things.
Fionna:  You saved the day mega-rad cool guy! What's your name?
Ice King:  Oh, Ice King. I'm such a great guy! This book is yours...
Fionna:  The Enchiridion! I want to be your best and closest friend.
Ice King:  Let's have a best and closest friend lunch! It's mac'n'cheezles!
Fionna:  Awww... what a good guy!
Cake:  Aww, what a sweetie!
Ice King:  [crying tears of joy] I'm just so glad you guys are real... you're really, really real! I wanna remember this day forever!
Fionna:  Don't be sad, Ice King! We're going on a space adventure!
Cake:  Hop on, baby!
Ice King:  Weehee hee!
Fionna:  Here we gooo!!!!
Slime Princess:  Ice King, stop, please. This story is terrible!
Ice King:  Hm? Wha--?
Toast Princess:  ...I don't even understand...
Wildberry Princess:  Maybe this story is a new form of torture!
Ice King:  Oh, come on! It's a first draft... don't hate! And besides, that story had everything. Action, adventure, a hotter, older guy... Wildberry, don't pretend; I know you like the silver foxes. 
Slime Princess:  What if it were a... little more like real life?
Ice King:  Real? It's based on the real Fionna and Cake!
Slime Princess:  Yeah... but what if there was a little more romance in the story?
Wildberry Princess:  Romance is a great idea!
Ice King:  Y'all are just hatin' on my steeze! I'm not listening to haters. Haters!
Ice King:  What the...? Whoa oh... I'm sorry I didn't think you were real, Gob... but now I've seen your power, and I've got some things that I did that I have to say sorry for.
Marceline:  Boo.
Ice King:  [shocked] Marceline, how long have you been in here?
Marceline:  Mmm... couple hours. [sits on the Ice King's throne]
Ice King:  Oh, so you heard my story, then... Awesome, right?
Marceline:  It's... good... but, maybe it's time to let someone else try. [She points to herself as Ice King seems unhappy and frustrated.] Listen up, y'all! I've got a story of my own!
Fionna:  Hyah! Hyah!
Cake:  Ooh, nice throw!
Fionna:  Thanks! I've got to do something today.
Cake:  What about Gumball's mission we went on this morning? Delivering daisy chains to the fluffy people not enough for you?
Fionna:  Uh... sometimes Gumball's missions can be so... lame.
Prince Gumball:  Hello, every--
Prince Gumball:  Oh my! Looks like you almost skronked up my dome piece! [He licks he finger then puts it on his 'dome piece' to fix it.] Boy, have I got a treat for you two! The fluffy people and I baked these in appreciation for the mission you completed. They're cream puffs... try one.
Fionna:  Uh... I'd love to, but... maybe later...
Fionna:  What was that?
Prince Gumball:  Aww...
Fionna:  Something's on the roof! Come on!
Cake:  I'm not going out there! It's wet.
Prince Gumball:  It is wet...
Fionna:  [frustrated] Mhnn...
Prince Gumball:  Oh... it's just him.
Marshall Lee:  Oh, hey Fionna.
Fionna:  Marshall Lee!
Prince Gumball:  Ahem!
Marshall Lee:  [sarcastically] Oh, forgive me! Hello, your majesty!
Prince Gumball:  Fionna, take me back inside.
Marshall Lee:  What? Is he kidding?
Prince Gumball:  Oh, honestly! I'm going in. Come and join me when you want more polite company. [He gets the umbrella and goes back down.]
Fionna:  Be careful!
Prince Gumball:  Whoa!
Fionna:  You got it!
Marshall Lee:  What a wad.
Fionna:  [Blushing] A... a gumwad?
Cake:  [gasps] Fionna!
Marshall Lee:  [chuckles] Let's ditch him!
Fionna:  Uh...
Marshall Lee:  [Turning into a giant bat] Lumpy Space Prince is throwing a party in the woods! It's gonna be freaky nasty!
Fionna:  Umm...
Marshall Lee:  I know you're gonna say yes to me, so... Let's just go.
Lumpy Space Prince:  Oh, yeah! Mmmm!
Marshall Lee:  This looks fun... bunch. Come on.
Lumpy Space Prince:  You guys! Marshall Lee's gonna play a song, you guys!
Marshall Lee:  Follow my lead.
Fionna:  Hey! [playfully pushes Marshall]
Marhsall Lee:   Good little girl. Always picking a fight with me, you know that I'm bad... But you're spending the night with me... What do you want from my world? You're a good little girl. 
Fionna:   Bad little boy. 
Fionna:   That's what you're acting like, I really don't buy... that you're that kind of guy... and if you are, why do you want to hang out with me? 
Marshall Lee:  [Talk-singing]   Don't you know I'm a villain? Every night I'm out killin', sending everyone runnin' like children. I know why you're mad at me. I've got demon eyes, and they're looking right through your anatomy... into your deepest fears. Baby, I'm not from here. I'm from the Nightosphere... To me, you're clear. Transparent. You got a thing for me, girl; it's apparent. 
Cake:   Oh, oh! [Singing] I got a hot potata! And I gots two hot tomatas! Well they'll make a good sauce maybe... 
Fionna:  You're not so bad, you know.
Marshall Lee:  Not so bad? I'm the son of a demon... and the Vampire King. It's not something I have to try at. You on the other hand...
Cake:  [Still singing]  ... on the table... the table... for as long as I am able! 
Fionna:  I'm not trying to be bad... I'm hanging out with you because you're my friend.
Marshall Lee:  What? [holds up a cream puff] Like him? [blows the dust off of it into Fionna's face]
Fionna:  [sputters as she waves the dust away] No... different!
Fionna:  Hey! Yah!
Marshall Lee:  [Sarcastically] Oh no... [Laughs as he floats in the air]
Cake:  Hey, break it up, you too!!
Marshall Lee:  Out of my way, kitty.
Fionna:  Hey!
Marshall Lee:  Oh, come on! That was funny!
Fionna:  Cake! You okay?
Cake:  Yeah...
Fionna:  Come on, let's get outta here.
Marshall Lee:  Hey! Come on... where you goin'? What's the deal? You're missing the party! Fionna, lighten up!
Fionna:  Look, I don't care if you're being a jerk to me... but nobody messes with Cake.
Marshall Lee:  Oh, really? Well, what if I just take her right now, you know?
Fionna:  What?
Marshall Lee:  Unexpected!
Fionna:  MARSHALL!
Fionna:  Cake!
Marshall Lee:  You want your Cake back? Come and get her!
Marshall Lee:  [Rapping]  Did you think I was lying? I said I'm evil, without even trying! [Fionna starts fighting the skeletons.] Already dead, so I'm not scared of dying... Drinking the red from your heart in one sitting. You think you've got me pegged, you must be kidding. I raise the dead up, and they do my bidding. Girl, I'm a thousand years old, I'm a riddle... Bad little boy! Yes, I'm bad, but not little. 
Cake:  Uh-uh boy, what are you thinking?
Cake:  Fionna!
Fionna:  Cake!
Cake:  Grab onto my little paws!
Fionna:  Marshall?
Marshall Lee:  Oh, this is bad, guys... This is really bad!
Fionna:  Marshall!
Fionna:  Come on! You gotta be okay!
Marshall Lee:  This is it for me, Fionna... so... why don't you just admit it...? You're in love with me...
Fionna:  I-I get that you flirt with me all the time, and it's funny or whatever, but you're doing that now?! [Fionna's voice begins to break and starts to tear up.] What are you trying to do to my head? You think I've got some little crush on you? Well, for however long we've got left... FOR ONCE, DROP IT, YOU FREAK!
Marshall Lee:  Faking it! Faking it! Okay, my shirt is, like, filled with cream puffs!
Cake:  Oh, goodness!
Marshall Lee:  Glob, Fionna... you're like the realest person I've ever met... [Fionna punches Marshall in the face] Ow, my cheek meat!
Marshall Lee:  Quit clowning, Fionna. F-Fionna? Fionna!
Marceline:  The end.
Turtle Princess:  Oh hohoho! I loved that one!
Ice King:  Oh, come on! You guys got mad at me for a bad story? I mean it's cute, but... that's not how'd they be! But look, it might not be too late to polish this piece off--let's spitball off some ideas. Like, if Marshall Lee gets sick and dies, but he's got a brother we didn't know about! His name's Marshall Lee...roy. Boom, shocker! [Rubs Marceline's leg] Uh-huh! I feel goosebumps!
Slime Princess:  I like how it is!
Turtle Princess:  Yeah, don't change it!
Wildberry Princess:  Yeah! It's good!
Ice King:  [Quietly angry] Everyone get out... [Marceline and the Princesses leave the Ice king's castle. Ice King sighs and then goes to his secret Fionna and Cake shrine.] I know you're out there somewhere... I just haven't figured out how to get to you... but believe me, I will! I will...
