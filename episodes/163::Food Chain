Candy Children: [All screaming and cheering] Whoa-a-a!
Candy Child: That was awesome!
Candy Child 2: Lets go over there!
Candy Children: Whe-e-e-e!
Candy Child 3: Come on! Come on!
Candy children: Wow! Yay! Whee!
Candy Child: Whoa-a-a!
Finn: Hmm. Why would I need to learn about caterpillar families? I don't get it.
Jake: Well, they look like they're having fun.
Finn: [Scoffs] Real leaves aren't made out of candy. They always have a gross, bitter taste.
Candy Child: Whee! [laughs]
Candy Child (Terry): Terry eats all the caterpillars!
Candy Child 2: Mmm! Ah, it's so good!
Finn: Ugh. That's gross, too. There's no way real caterpillars are delicious.
Jake: You think? I bet they taste great if you're a boid.
Princess Bubblegum: The caterpillar eats the leaf. Then the bird eats the caterpillar. Then the big bird eats the little bird. The big bird then dies, and its remains decompose into rich, fertile soil And from that soil, a new plant bursts to life. And then the caterpillar eats the plant again. And so the circle of life continues. This is a law of nature we call the food chain.
Princess Bubblegum: Isn't that fascinating?
Candy Child (Terry): Yo, Princess Bubblegum, do birds play football?
Princess Bubblegum: No, Terry. They don't. 
Candy Child (Terry): [Sighs] That's weak, Ma'am.
Candy Child 2: You guys, this is lame.
Finn: No way I'm eating a bug's butt. Those kids are right. Whats the big deez about the food chain, anyway? Lets hit the snack bar and eat something yummy.
Finn: Hey, this is pretty fun!
Jake: Hey, have you noticed we are birds now?
Finn: I'm hungies.
Jake: Look over there. That oasis looks pretty good to me.
Jake: Bon appetit!
Jake: [Gulps]
Finn: Oh, dude, you ate those?!
Jake: Come on, man. We're sweet, sweet birds, and we get to eat worms. This is a unique experience.
Finn: [Gulps]
Finn: [Groans]
Finn: [Groans] Uh, how did I get so mad chubs? I only ate one grub.
Jake: Dude, you've been eating grubs for hours.
Finn: What?!
Jake: Yeah, you're a beast.
Finn: Help me, Jake! My body's too bloated to fly!
Jake: Hide!
Finn: [Grunting]
Finn: [Grunts] There goes my din-din. Why am I hungry again?
Finn: Jake!
Jake: Who are you?
Finn: It's me, Finn.
Jake: Dang, when did you get so big?... And old?
Finn: [Stomach growls]
Jake: You feeling okay, bro?
Finn: Jake, we are good friends. So let me just say you look awesome right now.
Jake: Ha, really?
Finn: Yeah.
Finn: You're looking tasty. [Muffled] Hey, why don't you take a seat in my mouth?
Jake: Why? That's... weird.
Finn: It's okay. It's okay. Just give it a try. It's a new experience, right?
Jake: Wow, you have a lot of saliva. [Chuckles] You must have a broken pipe, old timer. It's comfy, though.
Finn: [Chomps]
Jake: Whoa! Did you just try to eat me?!
Finn: No...? But if I did that'd be okay, right?
Jake: You are trying to eat me.
Finn: I'm just following the Law of Nature.
Jake: What're you talking about?
Finn: I don't know. I just feel that way. [Chomps as he tries to eat Jake again]
Jake: [Groans]
Finn: Aw, Jake, you're missing out... by not getting eaten... by me.
Jake: Sorry, man. I'm not into it.
Finn: So alone. So hungry. [weakly] The Law of Nature... has claimed this... bod... [Groaning weakly]
Finn: Yay! What a big turnout. Top notch! To decompose stuff! Yeah-h-h! We are so pumped! Yeah! [Sniffs] What's that smell?
Finn: Wow. It looks amazing! Yay! Yay!
Finn: Party time!
Finn: So good! Awesome. This bird went bad so well!
Jake: You took it too far, man. I'm a dog, and I eat all kinds of horrible things. This is disgusting.
Finn: Come on, think of it as a conversation starterlike, "The other night, I ate the grossest thing I've ever tasted." You know, it's interesting. [Gulping]
Finn: Whew! I'm full.
Finn: Whoa! Aah!
Finn: Whoa! Aah! Whoa! Aah! What's going on?! Whoa!
Finn: [Burps]
Finn and Jake: [Laughing]
Finn: [Panting]
Finn: I think we're safe now... and also caterpillars.
Jake: [Breathing heavily]
Jake: We're still in a bind, man. No food, no water.
Finn: I'm hungry.
Jake: I'm thirsty.
Jake: [Panting] Hey, look.
Jake: It's another caterpillar.
Jake: Huh? You okay? [Jake waves his hand over Finn's eyes.]
Finn: She's beautiful.
Jake: She's just a caterpillar, dude.
Jake: Looks like she's gonna faint.
Erin: [Whimpering]
Jake: You see?
Jake: Huh. "Love is Blind"that must apply to all species.
Jake: Oh, I see. Your name is Erin, and there's a famine near your town, so that's why you're out here searching for an oasis.
Erin: Yes, I have to hurry and find food. Otherwise, my family won't survive. [Weakly] But I don't know if I can go on... [Thunk]
Finn: Hold on, Erin. Food! Water! Shade! Where are you?!
Jake: Over therethe oasis!
Finn: [Muffled] Yummy!
Jake: Really? You like leaves now?
Finn: So good, dude.
Finn: [Gasps] Your eyes.
Jake: Hey, hey, hey, move over a bit. I got a rhythm going here.
Erin: I've never been this happy.
Jake: [chuckles] [imitating Finn] This oasis is pretty romantic, huh?
Erin: Sure, I guess.
Jake: So, how many kids you want to have?
Finn: Uh, [stuttering] d-d-do you want to get married?
Erin: Yes!
Jake: And will you, Finn, take this caterpillar to be your wife, even if she becomes a flower or a bird or a bacteria, to love and to cherish till death do you part?
Finn: Y-y-y-yes.
Jake: You may now kiss the bride.
Finn: This way, Erin!
Caterpillar: Hey, is that my butt? Man, it's been a while!
Erin: Finn!
Finn: When we're reborn as caterpillars, I'll marry you all over again!
Erin: That's beautiful, Finn! But when we're bacteria, I might see other people!
Jake: Hey, why are you eating caterpillars?
Finn: My eyes are open.
Princess Bubblegum: The caterpillar eats the leaf. Then the bird eats the caterpillar. Then the big bird eats the little bird then dies and its remains decompose into rich, fertile soil. And from that soil, a new plant bursts to life. And then the caterpillar eats the plant again. And so the circle of life continues.
Candy Child 2: Eh, so what? Let's go play.
Candy Child 3: Yeah, weirdo.
[The candy children sigh and complain as they leave the snack bar. The exact same first scene replays with the Candy Children playing through the obstacle course, and the episode ends. To quote Princess Bubblegum: "And so the the circle of life continues."]
