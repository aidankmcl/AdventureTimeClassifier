Jake:  What'ya building?
Finn:  Um, it's just a little stick fort.
Jake:  Oh, rad!
Jake:  Look. It's just my size.
Jake:  [Role-playing] Hey, get away from my fort, you big stinky monster!
Finn:  I like it when you get small, Jake.
Jake:  Yeah, me too.
Jake:  Whoa, whoa!
Finn:  [Surprised] Whoa, Peppermint Butler!
Peppermint Butler:  Finn, Jake, the Princess wants to see you.
Princess Bubblegum:  As princess of Candy Kingdom, I'm in charge of a lot of candy people. They rely on me. I can't imagine what might happen to them if I was gone. And after my brush with death at the hands of the Lich, [while yawning] I realized something. [Stops yawning] I'm not gonna live forever Finn. [Whispers] I would if I could.
Princess Bubblegum:  But modern science just isn't there yet.
Princess Bubblegum:  [While unlocking a door] So I engineered a replacement who can live forever.
Princess Bubblegum:  I call her... Goliad.
Finn & Jake:  [Finn] Wow! [Jake] Aww! She's cute.
Finn:  Hi, Goliad. I'm Finn.
Jake:  And I'm Jake.
Goliad:  Hi, Finn. Hi, Jake.
Finn:  Hi, Goliad.
Goliad:  [Quietly] Hi, Finn.
Finn:  What did you use to make her?
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, um... [Starts brushing Goliads's paw with a brush.] Pretty standard candy creature soup.
Princess Bubblegum [Voice-over]:  Some acids.
Princess Bubblegum [Voice-over]:  Some algebra.
Princess Bubblegum:  [While picking out one of her baby teeth from the treasure chest] And I threw in one of my baby teeth so she had my DNA.
Finn & Jake:  Wow, DNA?!
Princess Bubblegum:  Yeah. All it takes is just one little tooth, or, [Pulls out one small strand of Finn's hair] a single hair.
Princess Bubblegum:  It's all it takes.
Jake:  Princess Bubblegum, are you okay?
Princess Bubblegum:  Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good. Haven't slept for a solid 83 hours, but... yeah, I'm good.
Jake:  Aw, you should go to bed.
Princess Bubblegum:  I can't go to bed, Goliad has huge, mondo mama brains.
Princess Bubblegum:  I still need to fill them with knowledge... [Starts yawning] about how to rule a kingdom. [Stops yawning]
Finn:  What? Let us teach her.
Princess Bubblegum:  Uhh, okay. I guess that will be all right.
Finn & Jake:  [Finn] Yea! [Jake] Yeah! Teachers! [Finn] Yeah, woo-hoo! [Jake] Teach, teaching teachers.
Finn & Jake:  Woow, woow, woow!
Finn:  C'mon, Goliad.
Finn:  [While leaving Bubblegum inside Goliad's room] See ya later, Princess! Get some sleep!
Princess Bubblegum:  Huh? Whu...? Bye guys...[Starts sleeping]
Finn:  Look, Goliad. This is a preschool. I'm gonna set up some obstacles and all that for you to learn on, is that okay? [starts patting Goliad]
Goliad:  Yeah, thanks Finn. I'm excited to learn.
Finn:  Okay, great. Jake, you go and get some kids from inside to help with the lesson and such.
Jake:  Okay. C'mon, Goliad.
Goliad:  Yes, Jake.
Jake:  Uhm...
Jake:  Uhh...
Red Gumball/Candy Child:  [while beating him up] Stinking, durken...
Candy Nanny:  Now, now, settle down.
Goliad:  Jake, these kids seem pretty scary.
Jake: Ah, nah, these kids ain't nothin'! Kids groove doozyploon! Check this out.
Jake:  Hey, there kids, who wants to play--
Jake:  Uhh, easy now children. Easy-
Peanut Child:  Get his brain! Get his brain!
Peanut Child:  Get his eyes!
Jake:  Listen up, you kids better stop donkin' around! You're gonna mess up Goliad! [kids start running in fear and stand by one of the walls] It's my way or the highway, get it? I'm Don Juan Cherry Tempo! Now march, glib blobbit!
Jake:  Don't be acting all crazy.
Jake:  Wow, holy shmow!
Finn:  Oh, hey, y'all are just in time. You ready to pop this croc's back Dr. Goliad?
Goliad:  Yeah, I think so Finn. I've learned a real lot already so far. Sooo much... from Jake.
Jake:  Uh, you know, Finn... maybe this isn't such a good idea, actually.
Finn:  Oh, no, it's cool. I got helmets for everybody.
Finn:  Okay, Goliad, you ready to lead? [Pulling out a stop watch]
Goliad:  Ready!
Finn:  Okay, in 3, 2, 1... [Finn starts the stop watch timer.] Go!
Goliad:  Alright, listen up! You kids better stop dunking around and get on that ramp!
Goliad:  You're gonna mess up Goliad! I'm Don Juan Cherry Temp [Kids start progressing with the course.] Cherry Tempo! It's my way or the highway, Glob-globbit!
Finn:  Stop stop! No, Goliad, no! Leading isn't about scaring people, you gotta stay calm and use your head. Use that beautiful brain, girlfriend.
Goliad:  My brain? Are you sure?
Finn:  Yeah! Don't be shy. Try it on me, lead me.
Goliad:  Okay, Finn. [An eye comes out of her head and Goliad's psychic powers show themselves as she starts to control Finn psychokinetically.] Okay.
Finn:  [Starts gasping for breath and coughs.] No, Goliad, that's wrong, too.
Finn:  You can't just control people or whatever, it's messed up.
Goliad:  No, Finn. This way is good. Everyone did what I wanted. Really fast, no mistakes, calm like you said. This is definitely is the way to lead. Definitely.
Finn:  Um, no, no. ...Wait, is that true? [Starts pondering]
Jake:  C'mon, Goliad. Let's go see Princess Bubblegum.
Finn:  Princess! Princess!
Jake:  Goliad's got mind control powers!
Finn:  She got the wrong idea about leadership!
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, I was afraid this might happen. Where is she now?
Finn & Jake:  [Finn] She's chilling in the garden! [Jake] We left her outside the garden!
Princess Bubblegum:  Hello, Goliad.
Goliad:  Hello, Princess.
Princess Bubblegum:  I hear that you learned a lot today.
Goliad:  Yes, I led the children.
Princess Bubblegum:  But Finn said you used yelling and mind control.
Goliad:  Yes, it was good.
Princess Bubblegum:  Goliad, [Gets a bee on her finger] let me tell you about leadership. You see this fat bee? It's gentle [Picks up a flower] and makes the flower happy, and pollinated. They both get what they need...[Bee gets some pollen from the flower] ...and that's how leaders should be.
Goliad:  No, Princess. Bee cares not for flower. If getting pollen hurts or kills flower, bee would not care. [Kills the bee] Bee is stronger than flower.
Goliad:  Goliad is stronger than bee. [Controls bee to hurt and annoy Finn and Jake] Goliad is stronger than all.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Gasps and starts speaking in her mind] Oh, no. She's too far gone, too corrupted. If we're not careful, she can throw an ultra-tantrum and wind the castle apart. I will have to disassemble her and try again.
Goliad:  No, Princess. [Bubblegum gasps] [Spinning her head towards Princess Bubblegum] This is my castle now.
Finn:  Don't worry, Princess. We'll stop her!
Princess Bubblegum:  No, Finn. She's far too powerful. Here's the plan: I'm going to build another Candy Sphinx in my lab. It's the only thing that can possibly match her. Just keep her busy 'til I return. [Starts to run towards the lab] And don't think about the plan! She can read your minds!
Jake:  [Thinking] Ugh, eyeball... Just tuck that eyeball back in its hole.
Finn:  Goliad, no!
Finn:  [Shouting] Jake, don't swallow!
Finn:  Uhh, you're in Finn's bubble.
Finn:  [In his mind] Don't think of the plan... Think of something else. Think of something else.
Finn [Flashback]:  Don't worry, Princess. We'll stop her!
Princess Bubblegum [In Finn's mind]:  No, Finn, she's too
Princess Bubblegum [Finn's mind]:  Anyway, like I was saying, she's far too powerful
Princess Bubblegums:  Finn, she's far too powerful. Here's the plan.
Baby Finns:  I'm a buff baby that can dance like a man. [Goliad focuses even more.] I can shake-ah my fanny, I can shake-ah myAhh!
Princess Bubblegum [Finn's mind]:  Here's the plan. I'm going to
Princess Bubblegum [In real world]:  Goliad! No!
Goliad:  Wait, brother, why must we fight? Rule with me!
Goliad:  No, brother! Don't you see? They're turning us against--
Goliad:  So be it.
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn, are you okay?
Finn:  Yeah, that dude saved me.
Princess Bubblegum:  That's Stormo, Goliad's new brother.
Finn:  Wha-- What are they doing now?
Princess Bubblegum:  They're about to have a psychic showdown.
Jake:  Wow, man, so, like... I guess they're so evenly matched that it's a stale [Spits out Chet] It's a stale [spits out another two candy people]
Finn:  They're so evenly matched that it's a stalemate!
Princes Bubblegum:  Yes. Stormo sacrificed himself to keep Goliad in check for all eternity.
Finn:  Well, that's pretty cool, but... I don't understand. If Goliad and Stormo are the same, how come Stormo is a good guy?
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, that's simple: I used some of your heroic DNA in Stormo's recipe and not Goliad's.
Finn:  Oh, whoa so, that means Stormo is like... my son?
Princess Bubblegum:  Well, yeah... in a way.
Finn:  Happy birthday, Stormo.
