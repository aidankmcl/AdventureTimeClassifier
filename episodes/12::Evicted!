Jake:  And as it waded through the carnage that it had wrought, the vampire smashed their skulls just for the fun of it!
Finn:  No way!
Jake:  Yes way, it did. And also the vampire hunched over its victims and breathed their vaporized blood mist.
Finn:  Ah, jeez! Jake, is this stuff you're saying true? Or are you just trying to mess me up? You have to be honest.
Jake:  Oh, it's true, man. I heard it through a reliable source.
Finn:  Reliable? Rats!
Jake:  Yeah. Some say it haunted this very tree!
Finn:  This tree?!
Jake:  [ominously] Good niiiight...
Finn:  Jake?
Finn:  You're full of it, Jake!
Finn: Errr... [he hears croaking and sees a worm on his bed] NO WORMS ON THE BED! [Hits worm with the Enchiridion.]
Finn:  Huh? [Lightning crashes, and the figure's scary face is seen]
Finn:  AAAAAH!!! [Runs downstairs]
Finn:  Jake! Jake! I saw someone outside the window! It must be the vampire, and I think we're unprepared, so I--
Jake:  Relax, buddy. I made that story up. I was just trying to scare you.
Finn:  But you said you heard it from a reliable source!
Jake:  Ha ha! I made that up, too. I was trying to scare you, and it worked! [laughs]
Finn:  No one's outside.
Jake:  Whew!
Finn:  It was just the wind, scaredy-cat.
Jake:  I wasn't scared, I was singing. I was singing my scream song. Ahh! Ahh! AAaah-uh-aah!
Finn:  You're a total wuss, man.
Marceline: Hey, guys. What's up? I'm Marceline the Vampire Queen.
Finn:  [afraid] Are you gonna smash my skull and breathe my blood mist?!
Jake:  Don't suck our blood!
Marceline:  [laughing] Calm down, weenies. I'm not gonna do that. [Lights candles]
Finn:  Sooo, you don't suck blood?
Marceline:  Sometimes, I do. But it's not the blood that I like. It's the color. I eat shades of red.
Marceline:  Ugh, I am exhausted. I've been traveling all over the Land of Ooo. And I've seen some stuff that would really make you say "like what?"
Finn:  Like what?
Marceline:  I encountered a school of goldfish beasts. [A flashback of Marceline riding giant goldfish]
Marceline:  And I fooled around in the Fire Kingdom. [A flashback of Marceline hula-hooping in the Fire Kingdom]
Finn:  OOO!
Marceline:  Oh, and check these out. [She has nuts in her hands]
Finn:  Nuts?
Marceline: Oh, these aren't ordinary nuts. [Squeezes the nuts and they become little creatures. One squirts Finn with ink.]
Finn:  [laughs] You're wonderful.
Jake:  Um, yeah. Thank you for not sucking our blood.
Marceline:  You guys seem cool, too, but as you can imagine, I'm really tired, so you two should probably get going.
Finn:  What?
Marceline:  [sighs] Look. [She uses psychokinesis and moves a picture frame and reveals an "M" carved into the tree] "M" for "Marceline."
Jake:  Aw, man.
Marceline:  I carved in this tree years ago. Way before you two rascals started squatting here. [Flings them out]
Marceline:  But seriously guys, thanks for keeping the place warm for me, I mean really great!
Marceline:  Good night!
Jake:  Come on, Finn. Let's get out of here.
Finn:  She can't kick us out of our house!
Jake:  Finn!
Finn:  Get down here, lady, and fight me!
Jake:  She's a vampire, dude!
Finn:  I'm gonna kill her.
Jake:  Dude, if half the stories I've heard, and/or made up are true, vampires will kill you. There's no question!
Finn:  But, what about our home?
Jake:  A VAMPIRE TOOK IT! Aw, we should go house-hunting. Bag us a new house.
Finn:  But I like our home.
Jake:  Finn, house-hunting is wild! You've got to try it.
Finn:  Really?
Jake:  Yeah, man! It is so nuts!
Finn:  You always know what to say.
Jake:  Bla-bla-bla-ble-ble-bla-bloo-bloop!
Finn:  Okay. I'm convinced. Let's roll!
Jake:  Sweet, things are gonna start going our way. [Clouds seperate to reveal the sun] Hey, look, see? What'd I tell ya?
Finn:  This is weak! I don't even like any of these places. I wanna go home.
Jake:  Finn, let me tell you a little something about what home really means. [plays viola] La, la, la... [singing] Home isn't a place, let me give you a clue... Home is anywhere, where people care about you...
Finn:  I don't wanna hear a lecture, dude! I just wanna go home...
Jake:  [singing] But, home is where your heart is, Finn! And where is your heart, Finn? Well, it's right here inside you when I'm sitting here beside you! [talking] With your lucky stars to guide you from above. [They look up, a star floats around, then poofs and disappears]
Finn:  Yeah, I guess I'd rather be out here, wrapped in your ear, than be in some awesome house all by my... souse.
Jake:  I'd rather be dancing with some babes!
Finn:  [laughs] Shut up, dude!
Jake:  Ew... Gross. This place looks gross!
Finn:  And abandoned. [Echoes]
Finn:  [gasps] Whoa, bro... Wanna just live in here?
Jake:  Yes.
Jake:  So whaddaya think, man? We did pretty good for ourselves.
Finn:  Yeah, we did... So, ah, what should we do first with our new digs?
Jake:  Let's trash it and throw a party!
Finn:  Ah this is it, feelin' good, I'm feelin', I'm feelin' like we did it. I'm feelin', like, completely satisfied. Nothin' else could go wrong, ya know, Jake?
Jake:  Yeah, man.
Finn:  Aww, yeah, I know, too.
Marceline:  Hey, Finn.
Jake:  She's back!
Marceline:  Wow, pretty awesome party ya got here.
Finn:  What do you want, Marceline?!
Marceline:  Oh, I just wanna show you somethin'. This cave belongs to me!
Finn:  What!?
Marceline:  Thanks for fixing the place up for me.
Finn:  Y-You can't take our home twice!
Marceline:  [With guitar] Yes, I caaaannnnnn!
Finn:  AAAAAAAHHHH! It's vampire-fighting time!
Jake:  Finn! Nooo! Vampires will kill you... remember!?
Finn:  But she's taking our home again!
Jake:  We're home as long as we're together, bla-bla-bleep-bla-bloop, remember!?
Finn:  Oh, yeah. Okay, Marceline, I'm gonna let you keep this cave, but only because Jake is my home, and he's way better than all your homes combined!
Marceline:  Ya know, you're right. I guess I'll take him too!
Jake:  [yells]
Finn:  What!?
Marceline:  I'll bite him a little, maybe turn him into a zombie.
Jake:  Nooo!
Finn:  Let go of Jake!
Marceline:  Make me.
Finn:  You okay, pal?
Marceline:  [transforming] No one... makes me... let go... of Jake!
Finn:  I'm not scared of you!
Jake:  Finn!
Marceline:  [laughs] You're pathetic, little boy.
Finn:  [grunts] You're pathetic! [Spits] Get ready for an uppercut, you dog!
Marceline:  Make me. [laughs] Bleh-bleh!
Jake:  I've... gotta help my buddy.
Marceline:  Your blood is mine!
Jake:  [warbles]
Finn:  [screaming] Jake!
Jake:  Uh oh.
Finn:  [Screams; runs up to her and punches her in the face]
Marceline:  Ow! That actually hurt, Finn. [laughs and kisses him on the cheek.]
Finn:  Why didn't you just kill me?
Marceline:  'Cuz that was fun! I haven't fought like that in years! Thanks, Finn.
Jake:  Finn!
Finn:  Aren't you dead?
Jake:  Naaah, before she bit me I used my powers to shrink all my guts and blood over my thumb, see? [Does so]
Marceline:  [Clears throat] You two are pretty hardcore. I can appreciate that.
Finn:  Soooo so does that mean we can have our old house back?
Marceline:  Yeah! Keep it, as a gift from me. Blaeargh!
Finn and Jake:  Yeah!
Finn:  Huh? Did you guys get on the bed? I told you, you're not allowed!
King Worm:  Oh, hey, guys. Come here, friends... Hug me... wawawawawawawa... Aw, yeah, hug me... wawawawawawawawa...
