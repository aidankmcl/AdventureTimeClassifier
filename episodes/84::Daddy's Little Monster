Jake:  Yo BMO, you done chargin' up that phone or what?
BMO:  Almost... finished... [The camera beeps that the battery is full and BMO is tired from charging it.]
Jake:  [Takes the phone] Thanks, BMO. Alright, man. We're gonna figure this out... right... now! [Flips phone open. The phone loads and the video begins to play.]
Jake:  Yo yo yo yo, check it! This is Jake on my camera phone! [Moves head back and forth towards the camera.] Whooooooooooaaaaaaa. Whoooa! Yo, Finn! Say 'hi' to my new camera phone!
Finn:  Whaddup camera phone!
Finn & Jake:  Marceline! [Finn walks over to her]
Marceline:  You guys wanna come party in the Nightosphere with me? I'm visiting with my dad and it's craaaazy boring.
Finn:  Whoa, wait a minute Marceline. Last time I saw your dad, [The camera is pointed towards Jake's feet as he walks over to them] I sliced open his soul sack. [Jake points the camera to Finn & Marceline.]
Marceline:  Oh no, he's totally chill now.
Finn:  Okay, but I'm keepin' an eye out for your old man in case he pulls any [Puts fingers around eyes] sneak attacks.
Marceline:  Don't be a wiener dog. Jake, you coming?
Jake:  [Turns camera over to him] Whoo! Yeah, baby!
Jake:  Alright. So, this is the Nightosphere, I guess. [Puts head in front of the camera.] It looks banay-nays. [He turns around] Marceline says they got tons of crazy ways out here. [Moves out of the way and Finn and Marceline are seen inside a cave. Finn is holding a tambourine and Marceline is playing the banjo. Jake walks into the cave, the place where Marceline is staying.] Right, Marceline? [She ignores Jake] Marceline! [Waves hand in front of the camera] Marcy!! [She continues to ignore him. He makes it look like he is crushing her head with his fingers and makes a claw hand and continues to do it.] Hehehe.
Hunson Abadeer:  There you are, Marceline. [Jake pans out and shows Hunson in his monster form. Finn and Marceline stop playing their instruments.] Huh? [Screams at the camera and Jake screams. He stops once he sees who it is.] Oh. Hello, dog. Hello, Finn. [Camera turns to Finn]
Finn:  Stay away from me, old man! [Points at him and shakes tambourine]
Jake [The one watching the video]:  Heheheh, nice one.
Hunson:  [Shrinks down and turns into his non-monster state] Now Finn, come on, there's no bad blood here! [Moves around awkwardly] Come here, let's bury the hatchet! [Hugs Finn] See how I'm not killing you?
Marceline:  [Groans] Dad, stop!
Hunson:  [Puts Finn under his arm] Alright, I don't want to embarrass my little girl. [Puts Finn down] So young lady, have you thought about my offer?
Jake:  [Walks over] What offer, Marceline's dad?
Hunson:  [Chuckles] I want Marceline to take over the Nightosphere! Finally join the family business!
Marceline:  Business? Dad, what do you even do?
Hunson:  Oh! [Chuckles] Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on... [Backs up and beckons them over, the camera points towards Jake's feet as he walks over and he scratches himself. The camera points back to Hunson and Marceline looking out a window. A burning landscape is seen.] Check it out, sweetie. [He puts an arm around Marceline's shoulder] See how chaotic it is out there? [Lava shoots out of the ground. The camera zooms in on them.] How everyone's confused and frustrated? The Nightosphere is sustained by chaos!
Marceline:  Eh, I just don't see my self doing this biz'.
Hunson:  [Raises arms] Okay. But I know you'll come around eventually. Or maybe you won't! I don't know. You're an independent woman! [He begins to make his soul-sucking face and Jake backs away, but he is just yawning.] Well, I'm gonna take a nappy. [Begins to walk away but remembers something] Oh! I almost forgot! [Takes off the Nightosphere amulet and it sucks his suit into it, he is now wearing underpants and an undershirt.]
Marceline:  Dad!
Hunson:  Whoops! Hahaha! [Camera zooms in as he hands the amulet to Marceline] You should put this amulet on. It'll grant you wishes for, like, ponies. Or whatever kids like.
Marceline:  Dad, I'm a thousand years old.
Hunson:  Ha! Yes you are, sweetie. [Rubs Marceline's hair, leaving it messy] Daddy's little monster! [Walks away]
Marceline:  [Puts amulet in her pocket] Look, let's play something, okay?
Finn:  Okay!
Marceline:  [Starts to float around and play the banjo as Finn plays the tambourine] I know you just wanna give your little girl the world, but Daddy I'm not just your little girl. I've got my own life, I've got my own plans, I hope you understand and like the way that I am because I want your respect and I want to be here. But I don't wanna rule the Nightosphere. [Lands in front of the camera and sighs. She takes out the amulet.] Psssh. Whatever, Dad. [Puts the amulet on. A suit comes out of it and wraps itself around her. The phone is dropped and tentacles are seen. The phone is picked up and Marceline is seen looking like her father's monster's form in "It Came from the Nightosphere." The camera zooms out to show Finn approaching Marceline while she laughs evilly.
Finn:  Jake, grab the amulet! [Marceline punches him into Jake]
Jake:  Ow, my hippocampus!
Jake:  Well... that explains how we got amnesia-ed. [Pulls out banana] But what about banana?
Finn:  Hey man, there's another video!
Demon:  We got mad prison overcrowding down here, fellas. [Throws Finn onto the bananas] So I gotta put you in the cage with the stuff. Sorry about that. But, you know, not really. [The camera zooms in on him as he slams the cage door. He starts to burp.] Aw, my stomach! [Cocks head to the side and bananas come out of both ears.]
Finn:  That amulet's controlling Marceline! We have to go back and help her! [Runs to the freezer and grabs bug milk] We're gonna get back using that one portal spell we know! [Draws a PHIL FACE on the wall and throws the bug milk at it] Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum! [The portal opens]
Jake:  [Raises arm] Whoa, dude! [Points to Finn] She told us never to come back!
Finn:  Oh yeah. Oh! [Climbs up the ladder that leads upstairs and Jake follows. He pulls out his pajamas] Jake! Can you turn into a gross demon?
Jake:  Mhmm. [Does so. Finn is putting on his pajamas.]
Finn:  Grosser!
Jake:  [Does so and growls.] What's your disguise?
Finn:  [Finished cutting out his mask] Paper plate mask, yo!
Jake:  Nice!
Finn:  Let's go! [Him and Jake jump through the portal and land behind many large lines of demons.]
Marceline:  Who's next? Who's next? [A demon steps forward]
Weird Punishment Demon:  Uh... me, my lord "Aberdeer."
Marceline:  What do you desire, cowering spec? Pain? Pleasure? Or... weird punishment?
Weird Punishment Demon:  Uh... pleasure.
Marceline:  No, weird punishment! [Creates a cloud and a green laser shoots out and zaps him. Bananas begin to come out of his mouth as he runs away.] [To a big demon] And what do you desire? P, P, or WP?
Big Demon:  I... pain?
Marceline:  Okay. [Zaps the left side of his body off.]
Big Demon:  Aw.
Marceline:  Come on, come on, next!
Ab Demon:  Uh... I'm just gonna go.
Marceline:  You sure, dude? Don't you want abs?
Ab Demon:  Yeah, gimme abs! [His face is turned into abs and Marceline laughs evilly.]
Finn:  I think we can charge up there and rip the amulet off her neck. [Amulet gleams]
Line Demon:  Hey! What're you guys doin'?! You can't run up to the front of the line! These good people have been waiting forever! Shame on you both! Everybody, shame them! [The demons in line boo them] Boo, sir! I "boo" what you're doing! Step back! [Taps Jake. Finn and Jake begin to walk back.] Back! [Pokes Finn and Jake] You will not cut the line! [Pokes Finn with cup] Again! [Continues to poke] You stay back here! And wait your turn like the rest of us! [Pinches them both in the side] Under... stand?!
Finn:  Yeah, okay, okay!
Line Demon:  I'll be watching you! [Walks back to spot]
Demon in line:  Sorry dude, you got outta line. I-
Line Demon:  Dang it! [Runs off]
Marceline:  Who are you?
Finn:  Ahh! Don't kill us Marceline!
Jake:  It's us! Finn and Jake!
Finn:  [Pulls up his mask to reveal who he is.] Your friends, remember?
Marceline:  Eh. [Lifts them to her mouth and is about to eat them. She laughs evilly.]
Jake and Finn:  Oh Grod!
Finn:  Run! [Marceline stomps next to them. They run into a crevice and end up in a kitchen. They look at Marceline through the kitchen window.] Marceline...
Finn:  What are you doing?
Hunson:  Just grabbing a midnight snack. [Closes fridge]
Finn:  It's Marceline! That's her out there!
Hunson:  I know! [Puts sandwich on table] Isn't it fantastic?
Finn:  [Slams hand on table] No! We have to save 'er!
Hunson:  [Puts mustard on his sandwich] Save her?
Finn:  From the amulet!
Hunson:  But this is what I've always wanted! My girl, following in her daddy's footsteps.
Finn:  But that's not what she wants!
Hunson:  That's balderdash, baby. The wearer of the amulet is filled with chaotic evil! Which is how I grew up. So... [Takes a bite out of his sandwich.]
Finn:  Maybe we can get these dudes to help us! [Demons murmur and one sighs heavily.]
Jake:  These guys won't help you. They're all complacent sheeple. [Begins to do a little beatboxing.]
Finn:  Wait, that's it! We're gonna freestyle a political rap to get these guys to rise out of their systemized demon apathy.
Jake:  [Uncertain] Okay... [Begins to beatbox]
Demon in crowd:  I never thought of it that way before!
Demon in crowd #2:  The system is broke, yo!
Finn:  Marceline! [Pulls her out of the substance.]
Jake:  Aw, sick!
Finn:  [Spots the portal leading back to the treehouse.] Jake! The tree house!
Jake:  Ahhhh! I'm too freaked out to move, Finn! These demons are nibbling my legs! [Pans down to show many demons biting and crawling on Jake's legs]
Finn:  [Looks at Marceline and the amulet.] Jake! Take her! [Tosses Marceline to Jake and falls into the demons.]
Jake:  No, Finn! You'll be filled with chaotic evil!
Finn:  Marceline... [Peers through the portal] No one... [Reaches his hand through the portal] leaves the Nightosphere!
Hunson: Marceline! Um, I wonder what happened to him! Kids these days... am I right?
Jake:  Dude... seriously.
Marceline:  Dad, you tricked me. [Hunson looks at her innocently] Dad, that sucks!
Hunson:  I know, I'm sorry. But I thought you'd want to, want to make your old man proud and you know... take over the Nightosphere.
Marceline:  Yeah, I want you to be proud. I want you to be proud of me!
Hunson:  No, I didn't mean... Baby, of course I'm proud of you.
Marceline:  Dad...
Hunson:  And your friends? They're alright! That political rap? [Raises thumb] Pretty great!
Marceline:  Okay, okay, I gotta go now, Dad. [Closes the portal.] Woof. What a nightmare. Man, Finn, my dad actually likes you. I don't wanna hang out with you anymore. [Finn is lying on the floor exhausted, sweating and is trying hard to breathe.] Finn?
