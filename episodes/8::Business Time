Finn:  Yeah! [Laughs and torches an iceberg] Yeah!
Finn:  I found another bike and more computers. What do you got?
Jake:  I keep finding baby shoes!
Jake:  WHAT THE HECK, MAN?! And they're all lefties! Sorry I'm not finding any loot.
Finn:  Keep it together, chubby, because I think we found enough scrap to finish building our gauntlet dock; a dock that is also a gauntlet.
Jake:  Aww. Building this gauntlet dock is hard, man. Hard work sucks.
Finn:  Don't be lazy, Jake.
Finn:  Huh?
Jake:  Incoming iceberg!
Finn:  Whoa! That one's huge!
Jake:  I got dibs! Ooo. I hope it's not baby shoes.
Jake:  [Gasps] It's a guy.
Finn:  Creepy. It's a buncha guys.
Jake:  You know what they remind me of? Well-dressed pickles.
Finn:  Stand back, Jake! I'm gonna melt 'em outta there! Full charge.
Jake:  Whoa, don't roast 'em, man. You gotta flambe.
Jake:  Ah. Perfecto. Bon appetit.
Finn:  Hey! Can you hear me? Hello?
Jake:  [Knocking on one of their heads] I don't think they made it.
Finn:  Hey. [Reaching for a briefcase] This one's got some kind of pack.
Red-tie businessman:  I remember... business.
Finn:  Let go! Let go! Let go!
Red-tie businessman: We... are Business Men.
Finn:  Oooh... Well, I'm Finn and he's Jake.
Jake:  What kind of business do you do?
Red-tie businessman:  Been frozen... so long, I... [The businessmen all shake their heads, as if in pain] can't remember. Can't remember! Oh. Looking for help, your business? We love work for you.
Finn:  Nah. Adventurers don't need any help.
Jake:  Yes! Help us fix that dock.
Red-tie businessman:  Dock-ka?
Jake:  Yeah! Right over there.
Red-tie businessman:  Yes. This dock-ka... could be more... efficient.
Finn:  No! Wait!
Finn:  Jake, this dock is our fun pie. We should be the ones to bake it.
Jake:  But they're begging for it, Finn. Just look at 'em.
Businessmen:  [Murmuring] Build dock. Build dock.
Jake:  Finn. These poor souls are lost without jobs. We can't ignore their plight.
Finn:  Uhh...
Jake:  [To the businessmen] Go on guys, fix it up!
Businessmen:  Woo!
Finn:  Well... they do seem really happy to do it.
Jake:  Of course, man. They said they "love work for you."
Businessmen:  [In unison] Uhh... We finish.
Finn:  Whoa!
Jake:  Told ya so.
Finn:  Come on! Let's try it out!
Finn:  [Laughing] Yeah! Woo!
Jake:  [Laughing] Yeah! Woo! [Panting] See? If we hire them full time, they'll be back in business and we'll be able to focus on fun stuff. Everybody wins!
Finn:  Maybe you're right.
Jake:  [To the businessmen] You hear that, guys? Maybe I'm right!
Red-tie businessman:  Really? Job? With... ad-ven-tur-ers?
Jake:  Yeah, mans!
Finn:  Feels weird doing nothing.
Jake:  Relax, man. This is your day off.
Hot Dog Princess: [From far in the distance] Help! Somebody help!
Finn:  Trouble, dude! Get your axe! I'll get my... wha?
Red-tie businessman:  Adventure pack... ready for you.
Finn:  Hey, thanks man.
Finn:  I have to say, Jake. My sword is totally shiny and stinkin' sharp!
Jake:  Uh huh.
Finn:  Even my shoes feel different. Not only are they clean, I feel radder, faster, more... adequate.
Jake:  Cool!
Hot Dog Princess:  Help!
Finn:  Don't cry, Hot Dog Princess! Jake and I will fend off these battle cubes!
Finn:  Man. I'm getting tired.
Jake:  [Groan] Me too. These cubes are... frickin' resilient. Hey, business dudes! Hold off these cubes so we can catch our breath?
Finn:  Jake! They don't know how to fight.
Red-tie businessman:  [Offering bottled water and orange slices] Water. Orange slices. Help rehydrate.
Jake:  These guys are great, right?
Finn:  I gotta admit... they are helping. [Surprised] Oh! I think I figured out how to defeat the battle cubes!
Jake:  That's 'cause you had time to rest your body and refresh your brain.
Finn:  [To businessmen] Ok! We'll take it from here, guys!
Jake:  Yeah! Good work.
Finn:  Grab all the cubes together!
Jake:  Got 'em!
Finn:  It worked!
Finn:  Wake up, Hot Dog Princess. You're free.
Hot Dog Princess:  Oh! Thank you, Finn and Jake! Especially you, Finn.
Finn:  [Whispering to Jake] Ugh. She smells like old hot dog water.
Red-tie businessman:  [Whispering to Finn] I take one for team.
Finn:  This is awesome! You get a promotion, fella.
businessman:  Take one for team, too.
Jake:  Oh... Lost again!
Finn:  [Grabbing the controller] My turn.
Jake:  What's that?
Red-tie businessman:  Hero vision monitor. Use satellite to tell us world problems.
Jake:  Oh, wow. Anything going on?
Red-tie businessman:  Just small things. You save stress for big thing.
Jake:  Freakin' awesome, man.
Finn:  What are they doing?
Jake:  Takin' care of business.
Finn:  Jake, hit me!
Video game:  Mission complete.
Jake:  Yeah!
Finn:  We beat Adventure Master!
Jake:  Holy moly!
Finn:  We're adventure masters!
Jake:  Woo! Yes!
Finn & Jake:  [Tired] Ooo.
Finn:  I never knew being fat and lazy was so rewarding.
Jake:  Yeah. [pushing around Finn's gut] You're gut's so huge and moldable.
Finn:  Hey!
Jake:  Hold on a sec!
Finn:  [Laughs] Man, that tickles.
Jake:  [Impersonating Ice King's voice] I'm the Ice King, and I'll never find a bride because I'm such a tool.
Finn:  [Laughs] Alright, let me try.
Finn:  [Impersonating Princess Bubblegum's voice] I'm Princess Bubblegum and I'm a dork, because I like science! I've also got a really annoying voice that Finn thinks is attractive!
Jake:  [Laughs] That's a- Hey, what'd you say?
Lumpy Space Princess: [On a hero vision monitor, running from a Swamp Giant] Ahh! Oh, my gosh! Leave me alone. All I said was "you're ugly," which is totally true. Somebody help me! Oh no!
Jake:  Man, I am not in the mood for saving Lumpy Space Princess.
Finn:  Hey, business dudes!
Finn:  What do you guys think?
Red-tie businessman:  Hmm... Just one monster. We do.
Jake:  Right. We'll just save our strength for the big adventures, then.
Jake:  Ahh. Nice call, dude.
Finn:  Imagine how awesome the adventure's going to be when it's time for us to go out there.
Jake:  I'm too tired to imagine stuff, but I bet you're right.
Finn & Jake:  [Both grabbing a tub of ice cream and toasting with them] To being great adventurers!
Finn:  Oh, gosh.
A voice in the distance:  Help us!
Finn:  Huh? Jake! Did you hear that?
Jake:  Yeah. Let the businessmen handle it.
A voice in the distance:  Help! Please!
Finn:  I heard it again.
Jake:  businessmen, dude.
A voice in the distance:  Heeeeeelp!
Red-tie businessman:  [Through a PA system] Woo-hoo! Woo!
Finn:  Jake! We messed up! The businessmen have gone bat-crazy, dude!
Jake:  [Still lying on the floor] Man, just let the businessmen handle it.
Finn:  THE BUSINESSMEN ARE THE PROBLEM, you lazy plug-hole!
Jake:  [Opens his eyes, surprised] Huh?
Finn:  [Yelling out the window] Guys!
Finn:  Guys, stop it!
Finn:  [Running up to the businessmen's robot] Stop it, guys!
Red-tie businessman:  Stop what, boss?
Finn:  You're jacking up those Fuzzy Friends!
Red-tie businessman:  But... We're being heroes. Like you, boss. We're protecting them. Collecting them in our care-sack so they cannot be hurt. It's the most efficient way to save people.
Finn:  But you're making them unhappy!
Red-tie businessman:  Irrelevant! These people are in our care-sack. Their happiness is not priority.
Finn:  I am your boss! And you guys are all fired!
Red-tie businessman:  Fi-red?
Finn:  Nooo! Alright, guys. Now I've gotta take you down... Finn style.
Finn:  I'm kicking your care-sack, dudes!
Jake:  Finn? Whoa... Crud.
Jake:  I'm comin' buddy!
Jake:  Ahh. I'm so fat, dude; I don't know what to do.
Finn:  [Gasp] That's it! Jake! Demoralize them!
Jake:  What? Why?
Finn:  Do it, man! I have a legit plan!
Jake:  Ok, Alright. [To businessmen] Hey! You guys are horrible at business!
Jake:  Huh? They're sucking me up, dude!
Finn:  Now, eat that ice cream some more to become fatter, while also using your Stretchy Powers to grow huge!
Jake:  [lifting his head up for a second] Ok!
Jake:  This sucks.
Finn:  Yeah, dude! Keep growin'! You're breaking apart their robot!
Jake:  Oh no!
Red-tie businessman:  [Attempting to grab Finn] I'm going to kill you, not-boss!
Finn:  Wait, man! Wait! I wanna re-hire you guys!
Red-tie businessman:  Re-hire? Really?
Finn:  Yeah, mans.
Businessmen:  Woo hoo!
Fuzzy Friends:  Yay! Hip-hip hooray! Pancakes!
Jake:  So, wait... What'd you hire them to do?
Finn:  I hired them to stuff themselves in that iceberg and get outta here.
Jake:  [Sigh] I'm gonna miss 'em. And I'm gonna miss this gut.
Finn:  [Laughs] I'm gonna miss my gut too.
Finn:  Aww! Aww...
