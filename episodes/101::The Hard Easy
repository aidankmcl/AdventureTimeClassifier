Finn: You getting all bit up by mosquitoes?
Jake: I don't know... I'm getting bit up by something.
Finn: Man, I can't believe you said this was a good swimming hole.
Jake: I said it might be good. It's not, though.
Finn: True.
Jake: Wanna just go?
Finn: Yeah. This place smells like green beans.
Mudscamp: My name's Woobeewoo.
Jake: [Turning around] Oh, whoa!
Woobeewoo: [Hops onto a rock] I need your help. My people are in trouble. I'm a mudscamp.
Finn: Yeah, Woobeewoo! Of course we'll help. Why didn't you just say something before?
Woobeewoo: I'm shy. It took me a while to work up the nerve.
Finn: Oh. Right on. You good now?
Woobeewoo: We'll see. [Turns around] Come, I'll take you to my village.
Woobeewoo: Here we are: the village of my people. It doesn't have an official name, but I call it South Woobeewoo. [Thunder rumbles] Uh, this way.
Woobeewoo: This is the village elder. He'll fill you in on the "deets."
Woobeewoo Elder: Greetings, heroes. [Squirts Jake with red juice]
Jake: [Disgusted] Bleehhh! Aw! Ehhh!
Woobeewoo Elder: I'm so sorry about that. You know, we--we secrete stink oil all day out our awful-sauce glands. You know, I guess I should have warned you. Anyway, lemme cut the cheese.
Woobeewoo on right: [Whispering] Cut to the chase.
Woobeewoo Elder: Yes... I mean--I mean, of course "cut to the chase," I mean, for many--for many moons now our village has been under siege by the Mega Frog. He's 100 stories of 110% 10-speed terror, like, bam, like, fresh out the grease. I mean, he chases us all up and down from first base to home, trying to eat us alive. We--we've always managed to escape, but it's c-razy scary, I mean, w-what if you got ate? Think about it. [Stands up] All alone in a stomach full of acid. [High voice] "Mommy! Mommy, Mommy, help me!" [Lower voice] "Billy, is that you? Mommy you sound exactly--" [High voice] "Mommy you sound exactly like m--" [sneezes] "Mommy, you sound exactly like me!" [Lower voice] "Billy, uh--" [Sits down; normal voice] Anyway. If this keeps up, we'll have to move to the city and get jobs. We don't know how to--how to do anything cool. Look, [Woobeewoos dressed in business hats are seen in the village] see, th-they're already practicing, the poor fools. They don't know what they're in for.
Jake: Whoa, relax, buddy! You're talkin' to the right couple of guys.
Finn: Yeah, man! Me and Jake will bust this Mega Frog up, right up his bumble-stop. [Imitates bomb whistling, exploding]
Woobeewoo Elder: That is excellent news. I mean, h-here, take this, please. [Woobeewoo villagers bring in a bag of lollipops] It's not much, b-but it's all we have-- [Finn takes bag] it's--it's a bag of lollies.
Jake: That's nice! Thanks, man.
Woobeewoo Elder: Now farewell, heroes! We're counting on you... for reals!
Jake: [Sniffing] Hmm.
Finn: Gettin' anything?
Jake: Yeah, but it's hard to make out. Could just be some footprints... or an old doodie.
Finn: Word... Hey, I have an idea. We can use those lollipops to leave a trail. That way we won't get lost out here.
Jake: Yeah, that's a great idea, man. I was just gonna throw 'em all on the ground anyway. [Drops a lollipop while walking] Whomp. [Drops another] Whomp. [Drop] Whomp. [Drop] Whomp. [Sniffs the air and points] This way. [The two climb a fallen log bridging a ravine] The thing with frogs is they got a real subtle smell. Kinda like when you open up a new thing of, um... CDRs.
Finn: Like... electric celery?
Jake: Yeah... but subtler. [They come across a large footprint] Mm-HMM! Just as I suspected.
Finn: Sweet. These'll take us right to him. [Laughs as he runs along the path of footprints] Come on, Jake! [Continues laughing]
Finn: Hmm. Huh. We've passed this butt tree, like, three times.
Jake: Oh, yeah.
Finn: We should probably backtrack--get reoriented and all that.
Jake: Word. [Sees footprints overlapping and facing different directions] Wait, these prints are all messed up!
Finn: Whoa. Yeah! Guess we better follow the lollipops back. Where's those at?
Jake: [Holds up empty bag] We ran out of those a while ago.
Finn: Snaaaap. Totally lost. Dang! Do you think maybe the Mega Frog made all those footprints on purpose? So we'd use up all our lollies and get totally lost?
Jake: What? Nah, man! Frogs are mighty dumb, you know that. He's probably runnin' around like that 'cause he's lost! [Laughs] Plus, we're not even lost. I just gotta stretch up past these trees and see where we're at. [Stretches head above canopy] Dang. It's all misty! It's kinda nice up here, though. [Lightning strikes his head, screams as he stretches back down] AAAAAAAAH! Man, forget that! I can't see anything through that mist. Plus, I got struck by lightning. We're just gonna have to set up camp and wait out the storm.
Finn: Cool! I call fire patrol!
Jake: Yeah, me, too! [Laughs]
Jake: Do you remember how to make a fire with sticks?
Finn: Yeah, man--it's easy. [Picks up two twigs] Uhhh, rub 'em together, right?
Jake: Oh, yeah.
Jake: I don't think it's workin', man.
Finn: I think I saw some guy do it like this once. [Spins twig out of his hands]
Jake: That's not it. I think you're on to something, though.
Finn: Yeah, here we go! [Wraps twine around a twig]
Jake: [Blows on a twig while twisting it]
Finn: Friction! [Pulls twine, twig snaps]
Jake: [Knocking two twigs together] Come on, boys, come on!
Finn: [Kissing twig] Mwah! [Sets down twig and writes FIRE in the dirt; shrugs] I don't know.
Jake: [Rubbing his hands together while holding a stick] You just gotta get some momentum going. [Pokes himself in the face with the stick; muffled] AAAAAAH! Glob-globbing stick! Glob-globbing swamp! [Streches up above trees and gets struck by lightning] AAAAAAAAAAAAH! [Comes down with lit stick, drops stick onto pile of sticks, runs off screen while screaming, comes back] Oh, hey, you got the fire goin'. Right on!
Finn: Jake, how did you--? [Roar is heard off screen] What the--? It's the Mega Frog! Quick, put the fire out!
Finn: Jake, look! [Silhouette of Mega Frog is seen crouching in field] He's just sittin' there! What's he doin' out there?
Jake: I don't know, but let's pound him while he's vulnerable.
Finn: Okay, Sweetles. [Finn crawls to the front of the field. Jake makes various hand signals from across the field.] What?
Jake: [Pulls on ear and lifts and drops his jowls] Whoaa! [Heads toward frog]
Finn: [Runs, jumps, gets ready to punch frog] Hoi-YAAAH!
Finn: Wha--? [Walks over to Jake] Jake, wake up. Look!
Jake: Ow, my head hurts.
Finn: [Pointing] Look at that thing!
Jake: Oh, what?! [Birds land on the wooden structure] Yeah, [laughs]. Hey, whoa! That gives me a great idea. We can make a Finn and Jake out of sticks and stuff and lure the Mega Frog out here, then ba-donk him right while he's all confused!
Finn: Yeaaaah! That's a great idea, man! [Mega Frog comes up from behind Finn] That's a great idea, Jake.
Jake: [Looking at Mega Frog] Fuh-fuh-fuh... fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh... [continues]
Finn: What? What is it, Jake?
Jake: FUH-FUH-FUH-FROOOOOOG!!
Finn: Wha--? [Frog squeezes Finn's ears, Finn looks up] AAAAAAAAAAAAHH! [Finn runs, frog chases] Jake! [Picks up Jake] RUN! [Jake continues screaming, frog gets closer] Jake, stretch us outta here! [Jake screams more, frog reaches for them] Come on, Jake!
Finn: Jake, let's hide in this cave. [They run into the cave] Shmow-tow, dude! That guy's gonna dingle our bones into tapioca pudding!
Jake: Finn, that is gross, man! Don't use language like that.
Jake: [As blow lands] Chomp that!
Jake: Aaaah! He's eating me! Aah! Gently eating me! No teeth! Mostly tongue!
Finn: [Still on the ground] Hmm? Hmmm... [Flashback]
Woobeewoo (in flashback): I need your help. My people are in trouble... I'm shy... I mean, he chases us all up and down from first base to home. We've always managed to escape--.
Finn (in flashback): You gettin' anything?
Jake (in flashback): Yeah, but it's hard to make out.
Woobeewoo (in flashback): I'm shy... first base...
Jake (in flashback): Yeah, but it's hard to make out.
Woobeewoo (in flashback): I'm shy.
Jake (in flashback): ...it's hard to make out.
Finn: Hmmm. That's it! [Gets up] Jake, wait!
Jake: [Pushes frog away from him] Oof! Sick, dude! [Sees Finn] Huh?
Finn: [Climbing Jake] I know how to stop him! [Runs up Jake, jumps off his head toward the frog, flies through the air, kisses the frog; slow-mo] Mwah! [Lands hanging on to a stalactite]
Prince Huge: Ah, this is rad! I'm hot again! Thanks, little dudes! [Takes Finn down from stalactite] I really appreciate it!
Finn: [Gives thumbs up]
Prince Huge: I don't get it, though... I kissed just about everything I could get my lips on. How come it only worked with you?
Finn: You can't break your own curse by kissin' somebody. Somebody's gotta kiss you.
Prince Huge: Oh. Weird. Well, thanks, man. I don't know a lot of dudes who'd do that to help a guy out.
Finn: Whatevs.
Prince Huge: [Laughs, flies out of the cave]
