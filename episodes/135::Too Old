Princess Bubblegum:  The other one. [switches passports for the gatekeeper]
Gatekeeper:  [grunts]
Jake:  [on phone] Finn? Finn?
Finn:  Sorry.
Jake:  Finn, I'm bored. Are you sure Princess Bubblegum doesn't like me anymore?
Finn:  Yeah. That's what she said.
Jake:  Sounds weird. Are you lying so you can do this dinner thing alone with Bubblegum?
Finn:  No way!
Jake:  I don't know if this is a good idea after your break-up with Flame Princess. PB is out of your age range, anyway.
Finn:  No way, man, I got no expectates. Whatever happens happens.
Princess Bubblegum:  [off-screen] Hey Finn! Let's go.
Finn:  Lates, bro. [to Princess Bubblegum] Comin'!
Finn:  Hey-ey, things got fancy around here.
Princess Bubblegum:  Thanks again for coming to Castle Lemongrab with me, Finn. I kinda hate these diplomatic dinners. Also, I think the Lemongrabs are getting weirder.
Finn:  Oh, uh, you know me--pretty good with weird stuff.
Princess Bubblegum:  It's just a shame that Jake didn't wanna come. I love Jake.
Finn:  Yeah. We all love Jake. [scoots closer to Princess Bubblegum]
Orange Lemon Child:  Announcing arrival o' Princest Bubblegah and little boy!
Lemongrab:  Princess! [grunts]
Finn and Princess Bubblegum:  Holy--
Lemongrab:  Oh, so pleased and gracious to welcome you to our sophisticated society! [bows] Bow.
Lemongrab 2:  Yes, welcome--
Lemongrab:  [screams] NO! Do it now!
Lemon Head:  It's... dinner time! [rings a bell]
Finn:  Yo, Peebs. How's your lemon?
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn, this is mega-weird. Something's happened to the two Lemongrabs. They used to be exactly the same.
Lemongrab:  [to Lemongrab 2] No, you're floating too high! [hits Lemongrab 2 with a chicken leg and forces him to float lower] It's time for the floor show!
Finn:  Hey, princess! Look who happens to carry a flute with him. [pulls out his flute from his pack]
Lemongrab:  No! Lemons only! Floor show!
Lemongrab:  Do it better! [pulls out a remote and presses a red button]
Lemongrab:  WHAT?! UNACCEPTABLE!
Lemongrab 2:  Hmm. Acceptable.
Lemongrab:  What?! UNACCEPTABLE!
Lemongrab 2:  [mutters] Acceptable.
Lemongrab:  UNACCEPTABLE!
Princess Bubblegum:  Ugh, I can't watch this any more. Excuse me, Finn. [gets up]
Finn:  Okay. Let me know if you get lonely!
Princess Bubblegum:  Man, this place is fallin' apart. Huh?
Lemonhope:  [sings Lemonhope's Song] Oh, hi.
Princess Bubblegum:  What's your name, little boy?
Lemonhope:  My name is Badlemon Nohope, but you can call me Lemonhope.
Lemongrab:  That noise! That ugly lemon and his ugly noise! [kicks Lemonhope]
Princess Bubblegum:  Hey! By all accounts, this is a brilliant and sensitive little boy.
Lemonhope:  Thank you, mistress.
Princess Bubblegum:  I'm taking Lemonhope back to the Candy Kingdom and enrolling him in a school for gifted children.
Lemongrab:  No. He needs to stay here. [kicks Lemonhope again and tucks him under his arm] I hope you'll still be joining us for dessert.]
Princess Bubblegum:  [grunts] We need to free that darling boy. Maybe there's something in the Candy Kingdom-Lemon Earldom treaty. I don't think there is.
Finn:  What about a prank?
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn, what are you talking about?
Finn:  Mmm, I don't know. Maybe if we prank Lemongrab, like, just right, they'll let us take that guy home? Yeah. Prank.
Princess Bubblegum:  I don't see how that's going to help us at all.
Finn:  Pranks, like old times.
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn, no, that's really--hmm... okay, yeah! We'll pull a prank. Like old times.
Finn:  Okay. [cracks knuckles] Puddin' [makes two holes in the pudding and pours baking soda into one] Bakin' soder. [pours vinegar into the other] Vinegar. [closes holes] And the bait. [puts a sign on it that reads "Special for Big Lemongrab"] Now when Lemongrab stirs his pud [imitates explosion noises] splode-cano.
Princess Bubblegum:  [laughs] Pretty smart, dude.
Princess Bubblegum:  Hey!
Lemongrab:  Ah, my pud! I'm going to enjoy this pud. I'm really looking forward to this pud. [dips spoon in pudding as a small amount of white foam comes out from the pudding] Oh, what is this?
Finn:  A-ha! Now give us back Lemonhope or prepare for mo' pranks!
Lemongrab:  Dungeon!
Finn:  [sighs] Guess I must admit. One would have a hard time claiming that to have been a pretty good plan. Sorry, PB.
Princess Bubblegum:  No, no. Your plan was great, Finn. [opening Finn's pack] See? What's this? Huh? [takes out Finn's flute] Your flute. Wow, now Lemonhope can play it and the Lemongrabs will come open the door to smash the flute and we can all escape! Really great work, Finn.
Finn:  Oh.
Princess Bubblegum:  Here, Lemonhope. Now will you play something for us? Something beautiful?
Lemonhope:  Yes, mistress. [plays screeching sounds on flute while Finn and Princess Bubblegum wince]
Princess Bubblegum:  Let me help you with--Lemonhope!
Lemonhope:  [runs to other side of the room] I was sharp at the harp, now it's my turn to learn the flute to boot! [plays screeching sounds on flute while Finn grunts]
Lemongrab 2:  Come, one and all, and join the dance!
Lemongrab:  [screams] How dare you? How dare you release my prisoners? Soft Lemongrab! Softer than an old graham cracker! YOU'RE SOFT!! [Lemongrab tackles and eats Lemongrab 2 and Finn stays behind to watch. He sees Lemongrab finishing off Lemongrab 2.]
Finn:  Yike! [runs off]
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, no! We're locked in. Finn, give me your phone, I'm calling Jake!
Finn:  What? No! Let's, um... we could do another prank! I brought some of your super-spicy hot sauce! Ah, so spice!
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn, this is serious!
Finn:  But, my other plan worked.
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn, your other plan failed, which was part of my plan, which worked.
Finn:  Your plan? But I thought we were having fun together.
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn, I have citizens who need me. I can't always treat everything like a little boy game.
Finn:  Oh. Yeah, no, that's cool.
Lemonhope:  Mistress! Mistress, look! Something scary is happening now!
Lemongrab:  [standing on a window balcony] How dare you? How dare you? After all I've done for you?! You try to steal my Lemonhope away?! You're too old, princess. Too old for pranks. Too old! [smashes part of balcony] I've tried imprisoning! I've tried reconditioning! You leave me no choice. Lemon Children! [pressing button on remote control and shocking the Lemon Children] Go forth! Go forth now!
Lemon Children:  Sorry, sir.
Finn:  Get to safety, princess! I'll hold 'em off.
Princess Bubblegum:  What?
Three-pronged Lemon Child:  Sorry, sir! [tackles Finn]
Finn:  Wait, so do you not like any games, or just little boy games?
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn...
Lemongrab 2:  Lemon brothers! Stop! Stop and listen! [presses button sequence on remote that breaks the Lemon Children's shock collars off] It has cost me much, but I have learned that lemon need not squeeze lemon to survive. Lemonhope, go forth, grow strong, and return for us!
Princess Bubblegum:  You're going to love the Candy Kingdom, Lemonhope. You're learn all about playing, and play-math, and learning all day long, and you'll never get yelled at. Unless you drink my soda from out of the fridge.
Lemonhope:  Yes, mistress.
Jake:  Yo, man, how's it going? Terrible?
Finn:  Well, yeah, mostly. But I think I learned something.
Jake:  Go on.
Finn:  Well, I'm thinkin' maybe age isn't just a number. Maybe older people, like, really are different. Y'know? Like, less fun inside.
Jake:  So whatcha saying here?
Finn:  I'm saying I think I really sponked up. I gotta patch things up with Flame Princess.
Jake:  Oh, dang! Didn't you hear? She's got a new boyfriend already!
Finn:  What?!
Jake:  [laughs] Man, I'm just kidding. [laughs with Finn] She might, though.
