Finn:  [bouncing:] Whoop! Huh?
Jake:  [bouncing:] Whoop!
Lumpy Space Princess:  [floating:] Whoopiiieee...
Princess Bubblegum:  Cheers, Lumpy Space Princess.
Jake:  Bouncing!
Finn:  Princess, this tea party sucks in a big way! But thanks for the invite!
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, don't worry, Finn. The Mallow Tea Ceremony takes years to master.
Finn:  Princess! I think I just now mastered it! [Tea splashes in his face.] One more bounce. [Bounces down] Alright! [Hits the ground] Unh! Tea partying's hard, huh, Jake?
Jake:  [Hits the ground] Oof! Yes!
Lumpy Space Princess:  What?! No way! It's super easy!
Finn:  Lumpy Space Princess, you big faker! You're floating, not bouncing!
Lumpy Space Princess:  Fine. I'll prove it. [She stops floating] Huh? Ah! Oh, no! [Bounces down] Oh, snap! [She lands with her teeth on Jake's leg.]
Jake:  AAAAAGH!
Lumpy Space Princess:  [Muffled:] Oh. Sorry I bit your leg.
Jake:  You're still biting me!!
Lumpy Space Princess:  Oh, my gosh. Oh, right. Sorry.
Finn:  Dude! Your leg!
Jake:  This is... new. It's nothin' ominous, though. Just a bump.
Lumpy Space Princess:  Nah, that's no bump. It's the early stage of the lumps.
Finn:  Is it serious?
Lumpy Space Princess:  It just means he's changing into a Lumpy Space guy, on account of my bite. It's just like, um, y'know... werewolf rules? [Imitating a werewolf] Ar, rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr!
Finn:  Oh, no!
Jake:  What? You think I'm gonna turn all lumpy like her? Get outta here. [Arm suddenly lumps up] Wha? Finn, I think I'm freakin' out!
Finn:  Calm down, bud! I'll... I'll sock the lumpiness outta ya!
Princess Bubblegum:  Hey, now! [Bouncing down] Royal intervention! Surely there must be an antidote to the lumps.
Lumpy Space Princess:  Yeah. There's an antidote, but you have to go all the way to Lumpy Space to get it. And Jake has to use it by sunset.
Princess Bubblegum:  What happens if he doesn't take the antidote by sunset?
Lumpy Space Princess:  He'll be lumpy, like, forever.
Finn:  LSP, please! Can you tell us how to reach Lumpy Space?
Lumpy Space Princess:  Yeah, I mean, there's a portal nearby. I can show you whenever.
Finn and Jake:  [Exiting with Lumpy Space Princess] Take us now! Take us now!
Princess Bubblegum:  [Intestines grumble] I should not have drunk that much tea! [Runs off]
Lumpy Space Princess:  Don't go telling everyone about this portal or whatever. It's kind of a secret.
Finn:  Where is it?
Lumpy Space Princess:  Portal's that Frog and mushroom.
Frog:  Password, please.
Lumpy Space Princess:  [yells] Whatevers2009!!
Frog:  Good day, Princess. Is your father okay with you entering Lumpy Space with two... [puffs out his chest] non-Lumpers?
Finn:  [Whispering to Lumpy Space Princess] Just say yes! Yes, yes, yes!
Lumpy Space Princess:  Yeah, whatever, fine.
Finn:  AAAAH!! Whoa... Lumpy Space. So, where's the antidote?
Lumpy Space Princess:  Hold it. First, you should check out my house. It's, like, kind of lame, but way less lame than, like, your house.
Jake:  Uh, could you skip to the part where you tell us where the antidote is?
Lumpy Space Princess:  It's up there at Makeout Point.
Finn:  That's so close! We can run there in no... [Camera pans up, revealing that Makeout Point is across an abyss.] ...time. Aww, what?!! It's, like, a million-mile fall into space!
Lumpy Space Princess:  Yeah. You have to travel by car in my world, or else you'll fall into the Lumpy Abyss.
Lumpy Space King:  Daughter!! Have you brought smooth people into our domain?!
Lumpy Space Princess:  I had to, Dad... I'm trying to help them, so don't lumping yell at me!
Lumpy Space Queen:  WHAT DID YOU SAY?! What did you just say?!?
Lumpy Space Princess:  I SAID, "LUMP OFF," MOM!!! [yells gibberish angrily, then pants heavily]
Finn:  Uh...
Lumpy Space Princess:  [To Finn:] WHAT?!?!
Finn:  Vroom vroom??
Lumpy Space Princess:  Oh, yeah. [To parents:] I need to borrow the car.
Lumpy Space King:  You have made your mother cry for the last time, daughter! You are hereby banned from using the royal car!! [walks inside house and slams the door]
Lumpy Space Princess:  Shucks! I lumping hate them! I'm really, really sorry, Finn. But I can't help you because my parents are horrible idiots.
Finn:  Don't you know anyone else with a car?
Lumpy Space Princess:  My friend Melissa has a car. But she's dating my ex-boyfriend Brad.
Finn:  [frustrated] Call her NOW.
Lumpy Space Princess:  Hmm. [pulls out cellphone] [LSP says to her phone:] Call BFF 66.
Melissa:  [answering] Hello?
Lumpy Space Princess:  Hey, Melissa. What's up?
Finn:  What's she saying?
Lumpy Space Princess:  [whispering to Finn] I'm asking her, jeez! Melissa, just listen!
Melissa:  Have you forgotten what day it is?
Lumpy Space Princess:  Melissa. I'm trying to help out some friends.
Melissa:  Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance!
Lumpy Space Princess:  Oh, Glob. I forgot.
Finn:  What'd she say?
Lumpy Space Princess:  Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance! [To Melissa, in excitement:] It's gonna be so flipping awesome!
Finn:  [exasperated] LSP, we don't have time for this. Ask for the ride, LSP.
Lumpy Space Princess:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh[Finn takes the cellphone] [LSP continues to say oh a couple of times until she realizes her phone is missing] Wha?!
Finn:  [To Melissa, imitating Lumpy Space Princess:] Melissa, [Lumpy Space Princess tries to retrieve her phone while Finn continues.] you should totally drive us to Makeout Point to make out with hot boys!
Melissa:  LSP, you're so baaaaad... be there in a sec!
Finn:  Biyah. [hangs up]
Lumpy Space Princess:  Hmm. [takes phone back]
Finn:  [Normal voice:] Sorry. But Jake's lumpiness is worsening!
Jake:  Actually, I think I'm beating it back with sheer willpower! [Part of his head bulges up.] [flatly:] Oh, my. [Forces lump back into body]
Lumpy Space Princess:  Yeah, whatever. Just don't mess with my phone again.
Melissa:  Hi!
Finn:  Ugh... OKAY! Let's go, let's go, let's go!!
Jake:  Aw, Finn, this music ducks, right? [suddenly in a lumpy accent:] Ah. I love this song. We should totally TP Shandala's house! [in normal voice:] Gracious! That was terrible! Finn, if you can't save me from the lumps... if I do turn... if I become lumpy like them, I want you to
Finn:  [while embracing Jake:] It's not gonna come to that. But if it does, I'll bury you beneath the nicest, most shadiest tree!
Jake:  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm saying that if I go totally lumpy, then I want you to get used to lumpy Jake. What did you think I was sayin'?
Finn:  Oh, um... [awkwardly] Heh heh. [angrily towards Melissa:] CAN'T THIS CAR GO ANY FASTER?!
Melissa:  We're already here! Hi, Finn.
Lumpy Space Princess:  We've been here for, like, five minutes.
Finn:  Finally! Huh? This doesn't look like Makeout Point.
Melissa:  This is Brad's house. You wanted a ride to Makeout Point? You think I want to make out with you?!
Finn:  Uh...
Melissa:  [blushing] Well, maybe I do, but... wait. [angrily:] I HAVE A BOYFRIEND, FINN!! [throws Finn down]
Finn:  LSP, we gotta hurry! Jake's running out of time!
Lumpy Space Princess:  Hey. This is hard for me, too. I mean, I used to eat chili cheese fries with Brad... so there's gonna be a lot of romantic tension on this ride!
Brad:  Hey.
Melissa:  Oh, Braaaaad... [giggles]
Brad:  You miss me yet, LSP?
Lumpy Space Princess:  [sullenly:] Scooch over, Finn. I'm gonna sit in the back.
Lumpy Space Princess:  This is it.
Finn:  Let's go!
Lumpy Space Princess:  Wait. Watch yourself, Finn. The guys who use the antidote up here are notorious for being... [whispering:] smooth posers.
Finn:  What does that mean?
Lumpy Space Princess:  It just means what it means. Hurry. Get the antidote so we can get outta here.
Finn:  Thanks, LSP.
Lumpy Space Princess:  BUUUUMPS.
Jake:  Um... bumps.
Finn:  Uh, yeah, bumps.
Jake:  Aw, man!
Finn:  Hey, guys. Lookin' smooth!
Glasses:  Really? You think we're smooth?
Finn:  Well, mostly you in the center, but yeah!
Monty:  Why are you sucking up to us?
Finn:  My best friend needs an antidote for lumpiness.
Lenny:  Chyah, lumpiness suuucks. Hey, Monty, time's up, sphere-hog! [Lenny pushes Monty off an sphere he was sitting on. Monty becomes lumpy.] My turn! [Lenny sits on the sphere and becomes smooth.]
Finn:  So the antidote is in that orb you were sitting on!
Lenny:  This orb is the antidote, bruh.
Finn:  Can my friend borrow it?
Lenny:  Yeah, sure, as long as you give it right back. [Tosses Finn the sphere and becomes lumpy]
Finn:  Hammacow. Thanks, fellas.
Lumpy Space Princess:  What's taking so long? Did those smooth-heads give you the orb already, or what?
Finn:  Wait!!
Lenny:  Is this another friend of yours??
Lumpy Space Princess:  What do you care? Just give 'em the antidote already, and stop being such a poser.
Monty:  Sorry, kid. [exiting with Lenny and Glasses:] We changed our minds.
Finn:  Why did you have to say all those rude things to them?!
Lumpy Space Princess:  What? I was helping you.
Finn:  [sarcastically:] Thanks a lot! [sincerely:] They were right about to hand over the antidote!
Lumpy Space Princess:  [bitterly:] You're welcome a lot.
Finn:  You insulted them! And they got mad! And now Jake's gonna be lumpy forever! [yells:] This is all your fault!
Lumpy Space Princess:  Wow. Now I know how you really feel. I was just trying to help, but whatever. [raising her voice:] No. No, not whatever! I know I mess things up sometimes, but I'm really trying! And you guys are supposed to be my friends! [tearing up] Not like the fake ones I have here! So do what you want! I'm going to Promcoming! Are you coming or not, Lumpy Jake?
Jake:  No. Because no matter how messed up and lumpy I get, this guy never turns his back on me! [Completely transforms into a Lumpy Space person.] Oh, yah. Right behind ya. Just gotta turn my back on this guy. [Literally does so then exits]
Finn:  JAKE! IT'S ALMOST SUNSET!! [to himself:] Jake... I didn't save him... I... [Yells wildly and angrily then punches the ground repeatedly.] I'LL KILL YOU, LUMPY SPACE!!
Monty:  Jam on, man!
Finn:  Huh? I thought you guys left!
Monty:  We were drawn back by your plaintive wail. We dig your directionless fury.
Finn:  Um, thanks.
Monty:  Respect. Here. [Tosses Finn the sphere.] Take it. Win your girl back!
Finn:  Yeah, there's no girl. But there is still time to save Jake! Do you guys know where Promcoming is?
Monty:  Promcoming takes place way down on that land-lump.
Finn:  Awesome. Do any of y'all have wheels?
Monty:  Nah. We were all ditched here just like you.
Finn:  Well... you think I can make it to that land-lump if I jumped off this cliff?
Monty:  You kidding?! A smoothie like you will plummet right into the eternal void!
Finn:  What if I was lumpy? Could I float over?
Lenny:  No, no! It's too dangerous!
Glasses:  I'd say there's a 50/50 chance of you making it!
Finn:  That's good enough for me. Now bite me!!
Finn:  [turning lumpy exceedingly quickly:] Yes! I can feel the multiple bites accelerating the lumpification process! I'm starting to float!
Lenny:  Don't jump, guy!!
Finn:  I have to! For my buddy. [Jumps.] RAAAAAAGH!!!!
Glasses:  Wow. He's insane.
Finn:  Ah, I made it! And there he is!
Jake:  Yeah! Promcoming! Yeah! Cool!
Finn:  Jake! I'm mostly lumpy now! And I totally think you should sit on this sphere!
Jake:  No!
Finn:  Sit on it!
Jake:  [Slaps sphere down] No!!
Finn:  Please, Jake! You're my best friend! Just sit on the sphere!
Jake:  Chyah! I remember you! You're just a smoothie wannabe lumpy poser!
Finn:  Sit on it!! Before I turn completely lumpy!!
Jake:  NO!!
Finn:  Oh, no! I can feel the lumpiness... about to consume me!! [Fully transforms into a Lumpy Space person.] Oh, yah. Being lumpy's the best.
Jake:  Hey. Stop talkin' to yourself, dumb guy. Take your ball and get outta here.
Finn:  Fine. I don't want you to have it anyway.
Jake:  So I can't have it now, eh?
Finn:  That's right. It's mine.
Jake:  GIMME THAT BALL!!
Finn:  NO! You can't have it!
Jake:  I want it! Give it to me!
Finn:  You want it that bad? Go get it, then!
Jake:  Bumps, bi [Sits on the sphere and turns back to normal.] [gasps] Oh, I'm not lumpy anymore! Oh, no. Finn buddy! You gotta sit on this!
Finn:  No! You can't make me! SmoothOOF! [Runs into a muscular Lumpy Space person and gets knocked out.]
Jake:  Finn! Hey, Finn! Hey, buddy! Finn
Finn:  [waking up:] Huh?
Jake:  Hey, dude. We made it.
Finn:  Man... There's something cold under my butt. [Noticing sphere:] Oh! [laughs] The antidote! Just in time, too! LSP, I'm sorry I blew up at you before. I didn't mean it. I was just really stressed out.
Lumpy Space Princess:  You know, it's fine. You and Jake can make it up to me by dancing this last dance with me.
Finn:  Sounds good to me. Whaddaya say, Jake?
Jake:  [Lumpy voice:] That sounds totally lame.
Jake:  [Normal voice:] Heh heh heh. I'm just kiddin'. Let's dance!
