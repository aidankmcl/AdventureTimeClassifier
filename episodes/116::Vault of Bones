Finn:  What's up?
Flame Princess:  Nothing, I don't know.
Jake:  If anybody wants tea, it will be ready in a few minutes.
Flame King:  Evil...evil...evil...evil...evil!
Jake:  Whoa, Flame King!
Flame Princess:  Father!
Flame King:  Oh, well, uh... Sorry, I... thought my daughter was alone... Well, I'll just be going now. Nice teapot.
Jake:  Ooh!
Finn:  What was that?
Jake:  He was saying "evil, evil, evil" over and over again.
Finn:  Yeah, I heard.
Jake:  Well, I wasn't sure if you heard him 'cause he was whispering.
Finn:  Yeah, I heard. 
Flame Princess:  Ugh, he's so annoying.
Jake:  Well, I was just trying to help.
Flame Princess:  Oh, not you, Jake, my dad. I always catch him whispering stuff in my ear while I'm not paying attention. He keeps saying I'm evil.
Finn:  Whoa, you best not be believing that whack bunk. I bet he's trying to make your life bad, so you'll think you're evil. But you're really not!
Flame Princess:  How can I know for sure?
Finn:  Dungeons.
Flame Princess:  What?
Finn:  Let's have a good time in a dungeon or something, that always clears my head that reminds me what's what.
Flame Princess:  And that will make me good?
Finn:  No, that will show you not to worry so much, because you're already good in here.
Flame Princess:  Ok, yeah, let's do it.
Finn:  Dungeons!
Flame Princess:  Dungeons!
Jake:  Camomile tea!
Flame Princess:  Is this how you look for a dungeon?
Finn:  Yeah... a lot of times the entrances are hidden, so you gotta look under rocks and stuff for a secret switch.
Finn:  Sometimes it takes a while... Hmm.
Flame Princess:  I'll just use my heat sense.
Flame Princess:  That tree over there is not made of wood.
Finn:  Really?
Finn:  Yes!
Finn:  Ooh... gauntlet.
Flame Princess:  Thanks for taking me out Finn.
Finn:  No prob, Bob, light this for me, will ya? [She does so.]
Flame Princess:  Oh, sure. Um... do we need a torch? I'm sort of made of fire.
Finn:  Oh...well, I guess torches are just cool for dungeons, you know?
Flame Princess:  Oh, okay.
Finn:  Yeah...I like to hang on to it.
Flame Princess:  Boy, this place is creepy!
Finn:  Really? I feel like it's trying too hard. Gold piece! [Grabs a gold piece he found on the ground and puts it in his pocket]
Flame Princess:  Oh, you mean, like, with all the skulls? 
Finn:  Whoa! Whoa!
Flame Princess:  What?
Boney:  Hey! What are you doing here?
Flame Princess:  Burning you alive!
Finn:  Haha no, no, wait a sec. Sorry, one second.
Boney:  Sure.
Finn:  He might have an important loot on him, so we don't wanna just burn him up; plus it's a little cruel even for an evil guy, check this out. [Threatens him with his sword] RRRAAA, you're gonna surrender!
Boney:  Okay, okay, I surrender!!!
Finn:  I shall grant thee clemency! If you do the splits! Do the splits!
Boney:  I-I can't-I can't do the splits.
Finn:  Do the splits, thou milk-livered maggot pie!
Boney:  Okay, okay...Ow, ow, ow! [Does the splits]
Finn:  See, a lot of times you can overpower these guys with confidence.
Flame Princess:  Neat!
Finn:  Got any loot on ya?
Boney:  Just this map. It'll-it'll help you.
Finn:  Ha! See? This would've been burned!
Flame Princess:  Yeah, no, that makes sense.
Finn:  What else you got?!
Boney:  Yeah! Uh, uh, there's a treasure chest in the corner, please stop yelling.
Finn:  Hah, hah! I knew it. [The chest won't open] Oh, cram it to the butternuts, it's locked!
Boney:  Aahh! I don't know were the keys is, please don't yell!
Finn:  Hahaha, alright. We can come back to that later. [To FP] Hey, are you having fun?
Flame Princess:  Mhm.
Boney:  I- I'll just stay here.
Flame Princess:  [starts running] Race you to the next monster!
Finn:  WHOA, whoa!
Flame Princess:  What?
Finn:  [chuckles] That's not how you do things in a dungeon. You gotta sneak.
Flame Princess:  Sneak?
Finn:  Like this. [Starts walking and crouches. FP follows behind and does the same] And you gotta look around. [He does so.] [They reach a wall and Finn stops FP. Finn peeks from the corner and sees a bigger skeleton guard. The camera shifts to the chandelier and to the rope holding it.]
Finn:  [whispers] Ok, this guy's too big to intimidate, but I have a plan. First, you shoot some fire at that rope, the chandelier falls, we distract the monster and we run in. Element surprise.
Flame Princess:  [Whispers] Wow.
Finn:  You ready?
Flame Princess:  Yeah.
Finn:  [Takes a step and retracts] Before we go in, how good are you at quietly throwing a tiny bit of fire?
Flame Princess:  Uhh... what?
Finn:  Like on a scale of 1 to 100, how good are you at quietly throwing a tiny bit of fire at a rope 50 feet away?
Flame Princess:  Uhh...
Finn:  Scale of 1 to 100.
Flame Princess:  [Thinks] 42.
Finn:  [Normal voice] 42?!
Flame Princess:  [Whispers] Well, I don't know! I've never rated myself before.
Finn:  [Whispers] Well, that's cool, that's cool. Just try to hit that rope.
Flame Princess:  Are you okay?
Finn:  Yeah, I'm good. it's a hologram.
Flame Princess:  Oh. Neat. So, uhh, should we keep going?
Finn:  Yeah, although it does raise the question. Why would someone go through the trouble of setting up a hologram? Unless... they've hidden something in this room? [Crouches down on the floor and starts looking.]
Finn:  [sees FP sleeping] Hey, wake up.
Flame Princess:  I was meditating. [Stands up]
Finn:  Look what I found. [Holds up a key.]
Flame Princess:  A key!
Flame Princess:  We have to go back?
Finn:  We don't have to, we get to! Come on. [walks away.]
Finn:  See? That didn't take long at all. Now we get treasure.
Flame Princess:  Okay.
Finn:  [Sticks key through the keyhole and doesn't open] Nope. This key's for something else. Haha. Oh, well. [Continues singing.]
Flame Princess:  [Thinking] Jeez. This is kinda boring. At least he's walking fast.
Finn:  See? That's where I found the key.
Finn:  Snapdragons!!
Snapdragon:  Take my place, take my place! Take my- [Flame Princess stumbles back and burns it in defense.]
Flame Princess:  Scatter fire! [Sends four bolts of fire that meet in the middle and burn the cage completely to ashes. She sighs.]
Finn:  No, no, we shake them down first, remember?
Flame Princess:  He... wanted me to take his place.
Finn:  [Rummages through pile of ashes] Man. Ooh, hold on. [Finds another key and holds it up.] Ha ha! It's another key! Now we get to go back to the beginning! [Runs.] Whoohoo!
Flame Princess:  Finn, I'm not having any fun.
Finn:  [Stops running] What? Why?
Flame Princess:  Well, you keep wanting me to do things your way. But I don't like doing things your way. Is that because I am evil?
Finn:  What? No, wait, that's... no! Uhh, hey, you know what? Let's do things your way.
Flame Princess:  Really?
Finn:  Yeah. I've been acting an uncouth lout, m'lady. [Throws torch in the water] Okay, so there's a door over there. What do you wanna do?
Flame Princess:  I... burn it down. [Makes a Flame Sword and marks a big X on the door. Finn looks unsure as she breaks through the door.]
Finn:  Okay, that worked. Now what do you do...
Flame Princess:  [Runs and shoots fire at random places] RRAAAAAGGGHHH!!
Finn:  Uhh... [Scared] Good- good job, FP.
Flame Princess:  Thanks, FTH! Haa! [Shoots more fire. Goo skulls start appearing. FP rushes to the door.] Ughh, doors! Burn, burn, burn! [She is stopped by a Goo Skull.] Huh? Ugh.
Finn:  Oh, Sham man. It's the legion of Goo Skulls! Uh, how do you defend?
Flame Princess:  Uhh... snake fire!! [Her fire ignites their goo and destroys them.]
Finn:  Fire burn goo.
Flame Princess:  Yes! Feel my flames, puny worms! [Laughing] The power of destruction!
Finn:  Woh. [Giant Goo Skull comes out from behind Finn and grabs him] [Terrified] Whoa! Flame Princess!!
Flame Princess:  Huh? [turns around in normal state and sees Finn being taken away by a Giant Goo Skull]
Finn:  Ahh!!!
Finn:  [Being spun around by goo] Help me! But don't use fire because you'll- mphh! [Muffled by the goo]
Flame Princess:  Release him or feel the wrath of the Princess of Flames!
Flame Princess:  Very well.
Flame Princess:  [Stops just in front of the Giant Goo Skull] Do the splits! Do the splits, thou milk-livered maggot pie! [Grabbing Finn's demon sword and yelling] [Giant Goo Skull does the splits] [Using Finn's demon sword to free Finn from a goo]
Finn:  Hot Daniel! Flame Princess. I thought you were going to burn me alive.
Flame Princess:  No way! I'd never do that to my boyfriend. [Finn blushes]
Flame Princess:  Ha, thanks Finn. That was a really awesome experience.
Finn:  Dungeons totes clear your head, right?
Flame Princess:  [Agreeing] I forget how good it feels to destroy stuff.
Finn:  [Confused] Uhhhh.....
Flame Princess:  I mean, like evil stuff.
Finn:  Oh yeah, cool.
Flame Princess:  We should go again sometimes. Do you know any other dungeons?
Finn:  Maybe next time we should just go to like... a farmer's market.
Flame Princess:  And burn it.
Finn:  Hmm, try this key.
Finn:  What is it?
