Finn: And when that salsa cloud had you by the tail...?
Jake: Ha ha, yeah. And I swung him around into that golden cactus?
Finn: [laughs] Man, that was algebraic.
Jake: Yeah, man, that adventure was tight.
Finn: Yeah.
Jake: I can't wait to get back home, though.
Finn: Yeah, me, too!
Jake: I need some sleep--
Finn: I'm gonna play some Battle Wars with Neptr on BMO for an hour, then work on that flier for PB's laser recital and catch up on my correspondence with my pen pal Danny Gladiolas from over in Maryville.
Jake: [nods] Great minds. [points to head]
Finn: And then next what I'm gonna do is I'm-- whoop! [disappears down a hole]
Jake: Finn? [runs] Finn! [hits head on branch] Ohh! [groans, stumbles backwards, and falls into another hole] Oh...
Finn: What the...?
Finn: Man, where's this supposed to be?
Finn: Uh, excuse me? Sir?
Huge King: Hmm? Oh! You're awake! Oh, that's wonderful!
Finn: Oh, thanks. Hey, where am I, anyway?
Huge King: Why, this is the famed Kingdom of Huge, of course. Heh. You fell through that crack in my ceiling and landed in a normal-sized pie.
Finn: Mm-hmm. Well, my friend up top is probs pretty worried about me, so I'd best get going. Can you give me a boost back up to that crack or whatever?
Huge King: Oh-ho-ho! No, no, no. Don't be silly, child. Your friend must be on his way to find you right now. You should wait for him here, or you could miss each other.
Finn: Hmm. I guess that does make sense.
Huge King: Of course! Besides, you're just in time to witness the chiming of my wondrous clock! It's set to do its chiming in merely an hour's time!
Finn: [to himself] "Krimber"?
Huge King: Come! Food boys! Shower our guest with the kindnesses of Huge! We will await the clock's chiming in style and comfort.
Huge King: Dig in, child! There's always more to come!
Finn: Mmm. Oh! Apple scruffs!
Huge King: Just wait till you see my clock!
