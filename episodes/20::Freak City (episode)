Finn:  Walking, walking, walking - hambone break! [Finn starts ham-boning]
Jake:  WooHoo! Hey!
Jake:  Get away from me. Quit it. [Laughs and blushes]
Off screen:  Food for a beggar...
Man:  Food for a poor old man? [Gets up off grass with a flip]
Jake:  Whoa!
Finn:  Geez Louise, guy
Man:  So you got any, kid? Food? [Hand out in front of Finn]
Finn:  I got this little piece of sugar. [Thinks] Nuts, I'm freaking all about sugar. But I am even more about feeding hobos! [Clenches cube in fist]
Jake:  Whoa, man. Maybe helping this starving homeless guy is wrong thing to do.
Finn:  Why?
Jake:  I don't know. I said "Maybe" [Shrugs]
Finn:  A hero always helps someone in need and besides he's probably a secret elf who will reward us for being nice. Here you go, buddy. [Hands sugar to man]
Man:  [snatches the sugar from Finn's hand and eats it] You know, believe or not, I'm not really a beggar. I'm actually a... [Reveals Himself] Magic Man!
Finn and Jake:  [Stunned] Whoa!
Finn:  Aw, yeah!
Jake:  He's magic! I didn't expect this.
Magic Man:  [Magic Man is down on one knee and starts whistling, a bird lands in his hand. While the bird is in his hand, he rubs the fingers of his other hand together and the bird is turned inside out. Its Muscles and fat are on the outside.] Magic.... Away! [Shoos the bird away, it drops to the ground flapping its wings struggling to fly away. Finn and Jake are distraught. Finn is holding Jake.]
Jake:  [with eyes closed and shuddering] Think happy thoughts... Little, cute, bees, little babies, tiny, tiny bunnies.
Finn:  what is wrong with you, Magic Man?!
Magic Man:  You gave me that candy now I'll do you a favor in return. A magic favor. [Zaps Finn, blue dust cloud covers Finn] [Sings] A mystical, magical favor! [Finn's body starts transforming]
Jake:  [looks on worried. Finn is shaped like a giant foot, well just his lower half. His top half remains the same] Whoa, dude!
Magic Man:  ...For you!
Finn:  why did you do that!?
Magic Man:  Because on this day, a magical life lesson comes to you.
Finn:  No! Change me back.
Magic Man:  Not until you appreciate what a jerk I am. Wazoo! [Magic Man jumps in the air and explodes into fireworks. Fireworks say "Eat It."]
Jake:  What a nutty guy
Finn:  What the heck, man?? What kind of deal is that? I help somebody out and they make me a stinky foot.
Jake:  [sniffs Finn.] You smell pretty good.
Finn:  [Shoves Jake away from him] Get off of me, man! I can't be a hero if I'm a big good-smelling foot!
Jake:  Maybe you're looking at this magic gift all wrong. Now that you're a huge foot you can kick evil's butt, like, way more times as hard. You're 100% kick, man!
Finn:  Why are you being so level-headed about this?
Jake:  Don't be a siss, Finn. Here, c'mon kick my butt. [Jake stretches his butt big and wide. Finn blushes]
Finn:  You're the SISS, siss! Augh! [tries to kick Jake but instead falls over, hitting Jake slightly.]
Jake:  [rubbing his butt] Ouch! oooh! Ouch. See, man. Let's give your foot body a shot.
Finn:  [still on the ground] No, dude! I wanna go find that magic man and get my body back!
Jake:  [Jake cradles Finn's head] Shhh shhh shhh shhh. Just be a foot for a little bit [J manipulates F's mouth like puppet]
Jake as Finn:  Ok, I will.
Jake:  Awesome! Dude you will never regret this. Hahaha!
[Next scene: still in the forest. Finn is upside-down and attached to some sort of spring catapult with a trigger.]
Jake:  Okay, when the next monster comes along, he'll step on that trigger over there, sending your giant foot body into the monster's crotch!
Finn:  This sucks, dude.
Jake:  [Caressing Finn] Shhh!
Monster:  [Off- screen roaring. A two-headed monster comes into view.] We're evil! [steps on trigger and Finn is launched into its crotch, Monster Roars] Our crotch! our evil crotch!!
Jake:  [runs away while holding Finn's foot body in the air] Hahaha! What'd I tell you? You're a great hero! Let's go set up some more crotch catapults so we can laugh and be heroes.
Finn:  No, Jake. Let's find that Magic Man.
Jake:  Finn, being an enormous crotch-kicking foot is a gift. Don't scorn a gift.
Jake:  Town on fire! This looks like a job for foot Finn stomping ability!
Finn:  But I-I can't even bend these big fat toes, man.
Jake:  You can do it, Finn. What'd I teach you, dude?
Finn:  [unsure] Not to scorn the kicking of people in the crotch?
Jake:  You got it! Now I'm gonna go rescue all the babies in town [deep voice, face close-up] --only the babies. [Normally] Get your hero on, dude!
Finn:  Aaahh!
Finn:  Uhh. Okay, you can do this, Finn. [Sweaty and determined] Start small, man. I'm taking you down! [Points at the fire]
Finn:  [screaming] It's hot! Oh, man, I'm smoking hot! Please, help me out! I can't move!
Townsperson (red shirt):  It's another one of those freaks!
Townsperson (green shirt):  He probably started this fire!
Finn:  No, I didn't start any -
Townsperson (blue shirt):  Throw him under the bridge with the others!
Townspeople (all):  Get rid of the freak. [Chanting] Freak! Freak!
Finn:  Unh! [Sighs and sniffs] I'm not a freak, I'm a hero.
Jake:  Finn!
Finn:  Jake, how'd you find me?
Jake:  Oh, I can sense when you're about to cry. It's like a mother/daughter thing.
Finn:  [upset] I'm not going to cry, man! I just feel like crying. We have to find that magic guy and [Jake lets go of the babies and they crawl away.] get my body back now!
Jake:  What we have to do is find out what reeks under this bridge [sniffs]
Finn:  Jake!
Jake:  Ew, it's blocking out your good foot smell.
Finn:  Get back here!
Jake:  Ugh, it--it smells like vomit on fire. It's like fancy cheese in an old guy's mouth.
Cyclops:  Welcome, travelers.
Jake:  Ahh!
Cyclops:  I am Gork, leader of Freak City. Ah, I can see one of you has felt the Magic Man's touch. [Looks at Finn]
Finn:  Yeah! You know that guy?
Gork:  I will tell you all that I know.
Gork:  We are the accursed ones, all once normal guys and gals who crossed paths with the Magic Man. [Gork proceeds to introduce the other inhabitants of the cave.] That's Zap, the Arm. [the screen is focused in Zap, a pink humanoid arm. Zap mumbles.] Trudy, the Waist. [Trudy is shown as a blue lump. Trudy coughs.] That's Wee Wee and Gorflax. [They are shown as light brown ovals lying in a puddle. One is biting the other.] They were turned into tonsils and that's Kim. [Kim kisses a can and chuckles. She is beige colored leg.] But, please, make yourselves at home. Would you like something to drink?
Jake:  Do you have any orange juice?
Gork:  No. [Pause] Well, uh, I don't know. Maybe. Uh, I don't think so. I'll go check.
Jake:  Yo, Finn, this place is really bumming me out. Let's get out of here.
Finn:  What?! No, dude. These guys might be my only hope of finding the Magic Man.
Gork:  Hey, we actually do have orange juice.
Finn:  Thanks for being cool and all, but what do you know about this Magic Man? How do we catch him?
Gork:  Oh, he can't be caught. He's got magic and we're worthless freaks. We can't ever beat him. So we've gather here to wallow in our self-pity.
Finn:  But don't y'all even want to try?
Kim:  Eh, no.
Finn:  Why not? You're all totally miserable here.
Zap:  Ugh. It's a living.
Finn:  No, it's not, Zap! It's not a living! It's dookie diapers! I don't want to be a foot!
Trudy:  Well, get used to it. We did.
Jake:  Yeah, Finn, maybe there's another lesson to be learned here--
Jake:  To accept what fate has given you [puts his arm around a rat] and stay a miserable foot. Gork, can we stay here in this pile of trash and rats forever?
Gork:  Yeah, man. Do it up.
Jake:  [flops down in trash] Awesome. [Rats flock to his body] Here we go.
Finn:  Jake, stop screwing around. [slumps] You're gonna make me give into depression.
Jake:  [rats crawl on his face] Eh, what are you going to do about it? Probably nothing, right? If you're depressed, you'll do nothing. [Rolls over]
Finn:  I... [Depressed] Maybe I will do nothing.] Maybe I'll just lay down here. [Grunts and struggles to get to the floor] Lay down -uh [falls to the ground]--and rot like the rest of you.
Jake:  [Excited] Yeah! [Chanting] Stay a foot! Stay a foot! Stay a foot!
Finn:  [singing]  Is this really my life?
Finn:  Get up, Gork!
Gork:  Huh? Why?
Finn:   I'm not gonna let you lie here,
Gork:  Whoa. Okay man, just be cool.
Finn:   And I'm not gonna be cool!
Jake:  Hey, Finn.
Finn:   Ja-a-a-ke, stop tellin' me to enjoy, bein' a foot, and get out of that trash! 
Jake:  Heh heh. I can't take you seriously when you're singing, man.
Finn:  Get up!
Jake:  Ahh!
Finn:  All of you make me sick!
Gork:  Wait, Finn!
Gork:  Hey, stop it, man! [Gork, Kim, Zap, and Trudy stand up.] We don't like touching each other.
Finn:  Huh?
Gork:  Please, man.
Finn:  Wait a second. Kim, get underneath Trudy.
Kim:  No, man. Please. I freakin' hate Trudy.
Finn:  [angry] Kim, I will destroy you!
Kim:  Okay, Okay! [Moves to get under Trudy]
Jake:  Yeah, do it, Kim.
Finn:  Yes! Now for me [gets on the other side under Trudy] Look at us!
Jake:  Whoa!
Gork:  We're like a big, normal guy.
Kim:  Thank you so much
Zap:  We are perfect together
Kim:  Oh, Finn, thank you.
Finn:  Word! Now let's go wreck up that Magic Man!
Jake:  Let me get in on this. I'll form the pants. [Jake wraps his body around them]
Magic Man:  Food. Food for a beggar
Magic Man:  Y'all got any food?
Gork:  We've got a little orange juice left over from - Wait a second...
Magic Man:  That's right. It is I, the magic Man! [Reveals himself and heaves magic their way.] Zap
Magic Man:  Come on, apple grease! What are you gonna do?
Magic Man:  Ohh!
Zap:  We're not afraid.
Magic Man:  Are you sure about that?
Finn:  You're darn right we are!
Finn:  Give us our bodies back!
Magic Man:  Why should I? You still act like a hero only so you can get what you want.
Finn:  Oh. You were trying to teach us to be kind without expecting anything return. I should've given you that sugar cube without even thinking about a reward.
Magic Man:  Wrong! [Hurls magic at them again. It hits Finn in the face.]
Finn:  Ah, geez!
Jake:  [worried] Finn!
Finn:  [angry] You've gifted us nothing but heartache, Magic Man! What is the life lesson in that?!
Magic Man:  [laughs maniacally] Yes, my children, you are so close to the answer.
Finn:  Answer this!
Kim:  Get his eyes! Cut him in the eyes!
Finn:  I wish I'd never been nice to you 'cause you're just a big jerk!
Magic Man:  Oh, yes, that's it! [Slips from under Finn's foot body] You've finally learned your lesson. [Zaps them with magic that returns them back to normal] And now I'm off spread my teachings to more sissy do-gooders. [Opens a portal to escape] You're welcome!
Finn:  Man, I frickin' hate that guy. But at least now we can all go back to our regular lives.
Gork:  Well, actually, we like being like this
Zap:  Yeah, we're strong together
All:  Bye, Finn! Thank you!
Finn:  Oh, okay. Bye, guys. See you, later. [Waves back at them] Wait, so, what was the lesson we just learned?
Jake:  [shrugs] Maybe it was, don't give your sugar to jerks.
Finn:  Speaking of jerks, what the blubbins, man?! Why wouldn't you help me turn back into a boy?!
Jake:  Well, because I kind of always wanted [mumbles]
Finn:  What?
Jake:  [embarrassed] I said, I kind of always wanted to be a foot myself.
Finn:  You could be a foot right now. I saw you change into a foot twice yesterday.
Jake:  It's complicated, man. You'll understand when you're older.
