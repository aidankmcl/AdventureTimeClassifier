Pat McHale:  In the dark recesses of the mind, a disease known as fear feasts upon the souls who cannot overcome its power...
Finn:  Come back, thief!
Jake:  Whoa!
Fire Newt:  Stop farting on me! It's gross!
Finn:  You can't just go around stealing boots.
Jake:  Yeah, and you know the penalty for stealing boots. It's poots... on newts.
Both:  [Laughs]
Finn:  He's getting away in that lake!
Jake:  Dude, that isn't a lake. That's an ocean.
Finn:  [Laughs and runs after Jake] Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! ...Huh?
Finn:  Uhh...
Jake:  [Laughing and farting on the Newt] Poots on newts! Poots on newts!
Fire Newt:  No!
Jake:  [Slow-motion] Poots on newts!
Finn:  [laughs and starts removing his shoes] I'm coming, Jake. I'll poot on that newt as soon as I'm barefoot. Uh...
Finn:  [Breaths heavily, his stomach rumbles] Ow! Why is my stomach going nuts?
Finn:  Ow!
Finn:  Wh-wh-wh-Who are you?
Fear Feaster:  I am the manifestation of your fear... fear of the ocean!
Finn:  What? I'm not afraid of lakes, wells, or rivers, streams, or deep wells or puddles. Why would I be afraid of- [Screams and backs away from the water]
Fear Feaster:  [Laughs] 'Cause you're a wuss.
Finn:  I'm no wuss! I'm the hero around these parts!
Fear Feaster:  Ha! You're too scared of the ocean to ever be a true hero.
Finn:  Not true! I'm not scared of nothin'!
Finn:  [Shakes his head and takes a deep breath] I shall conquer my fear.
Fear Feaster:  Yeah, right.
Finn:  No! I will. I'll conquer my fear.
Fear Feaster:  Of course you will, [Receding back into Finn's navel] and I live in a two bedroom apartment that doesn't smell like vomit [Laughs] ...Sarcasm.
Jake:  Dude. Dude, did you see me? I was all like womp, and then I was all like take this! Womp! Womp! And then... Hey, what's wrong with you, dude?
Finn:  Jake. I think I'm afraid... of the ocean.
Jake:  Say what, now?
Finn:  I need your help to overcome my fear. Will you do it?
Jake:  Um... No... I don't really wanna do it.
Finn:  Jake! Come on!
Jake:  I'm just messing with you. I'll do it. Hmm... Where to start? Oh, ok. I think we should just take a few steps in the water. You can hold Jake's hand if you're scared.
Jake:  Um... Oh it's ok, dude. I see the problem. It's just your feet.
Jake:  [Manually moving Finn's feet forward one at a time] Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop.
Finn:  Don't be scared. I shall not be scared.
Jake:  [Still moving Finn's feet] Boop. Boop.
Finn:  I'm afraid! Ah! [Jumps on top of Jake and starts punching him] Jake, get me out of the water! Now, Jake! Now! Now!
Jake:  Hot jam! You're really scared of the ocean. In fact, you're so scared... it gives me an idea. Let's start a business of being scared of the ocean!
Finn:  Jake!
Jake:  Ok. Ok. I have a plan to get rid of your fear. We'll start tomorrow morning.
Finn:  But I must conquer this now! [Runs towards the ocean screaming] I'm not afraid of you!
Finn:  [reels back in slow-motion and screams]
Finn:  [Running backwards] I'm afraid of you! I'm afraid of you! [Screams]
Finn:  [Exhaustedly crawls to Jake's feet] Ok, yeah. Let's try tomorrow.
Jake:  Fiiiinn. Finn. Hey, Finn. Wake up.
Finn:  [Opens his eyes] Morning, Jake.
Jake:  Ready for me to help you get over your ocean fear?
Finn:  Yeah, man.
Jake:  Cool... but I can only do this if you ask me.
Finn:  I'm askin'!
Jake:  Then get ready for my three-step plan. Watch your troubles melt away with step one!
Finn:  [Screams] Jake, are you crazy? This is not an OK thing to do!
Jake:  Hey. Hey. Come on. The ocean is your friend, and you got friends all around you right now. Miles and miles of friends.
Finn:  You're nuts. [Wriggles from side to side]
Jake:  Don't try to struggle, man. [Pulls the blankets back, revealing that Finn is tied to the bed] I'll let you out in a second. You just need to calm down.
Finn:  Really? Ok. I'm calming down.
Jake:  That's great. You're doing great. Ready for step two?
Finn:  [Breathing heavily] Yeah, man. I can do it.
Jake:  Alright, dude. Step... two! [Unties the rope]
Finn:  [Screams] Jake, this isn't a joke! It's touching me!
Jake:  Let it hold you, man! Let it hold you like a child!
Finn:  [Heart pounding] I'm trying to let it hold me.
Jake:  Control your breathing!
Finn:  [Breathes in and out] This isn't working!
Jake:  That means we gotta move to step three. Just don't scream.
Finn:  W-what?
Jake:  I'm gonna push you underwater with my jowls. Just don't scream. Don't scream.
Finn:  What?!
Jake:  Don't scream. Hold your breath, Finn. You got it, dude!
Finn:  Get me away, Jake! Now, Jake! Now! Right now! Get-Get me away! [Screams]
Jake:  Finn! Stop it, Finn! Ow!
Finn:  [Laughs] I'm safe! I'm safe! How'd I do?
Jake:  I think we should give up.
Finn:  What? I made it all the way to level three.
Jake:  Look, Finn. It's not that I don't want to help you... I just don't wanna get beat up anymore. I mean this [Pointing to his face] is my bread and butter. I can't have you messing up my bread and butter, dude.
Finn:  You have to help me. I can't do this without you.
Jake:  Ok. Fine... but only if you swear not to hit me anymore.
Finn:  I swear I won't hit you anymore.
Jake:  And also swear to only speak in rhymes. Speak in rhymes all the times.
Finn:  I swear... and pigs have hair.
Jake:  Yes. Perfect. And since you want more... it's time for step four.
Finn:  What? I thought you said it was a three step plan... man.
Jake:  I'm not that good at counting. [Laughs and grabs a small, rusty submarine] Come on. Let's go kick your fear of the ocean where the sun don't shine... in the sea cucumber.
Jake:  Check it, dude. One hundred percent awesome-itude.
Finn:  [Eyes closed, breathes heavily and shivers] Yeah. It's pretty math... you psychopath.
Jake:  You know, it looks way more math if you open up your eyes.
Finn:  [Opens his eyes] Whoa...
Jake:  See, man? The ocean is beautiful. There's no reason to be afraid of things that are beautiful.
Finn:  Hey. This isn't that bad. I'm actually glad.
Jake:  [Points] Hey, look! A black abyss! Let's go check it out... sauerkraut.
Finn:  No, Jake! Turn around! Turn around!
Finn:  Noooo!
Jake:  Saying, "Turn around" twice doesn't count as a rhyme, dude.
Jake:  Hey, you swore!
Jake:  Ow! My bread and butter!
Jake:  No, dude! Don't!
Jake:  Don't worry, dude. Everything's cool. This is the perfect segue into level five. [Handing Finn a dive suit] Here, put this on.
Jake:  Just make sure you don't pull the emergency tab.
Jake:  No, dude! I said don't...
Finn:  Jake? Jaaaaaake!
Finn:  Jake!
Fear Feaster:  [Laughs] Pathetic! You can't even overcome your fear now that your friend is about to die! Your un-heroic body will never let you save Jake. [Laughs]
Finn:  [Sadly] You're right.
Fear Feaster:  What? Really? You think I'm right? Well, that's... that's great!
Finn:  [Holding a wrench] If my body won't let me rescue my best friend, then there's only one thing left to do.
Fear Feaster:  No. Wait. No! Noooo!
Finn:  Jake! Jake! Wake up!
Finn:  You ok, dude?
Jake:  Yeah, man. Wait... Finn, you did it! You conquered your fear!
Finn:  What?
Jake:  You're at the bottom of the ocean!
Jake:  Maybe we should celebrate on land.
Jake:  I'm proud of you man. You did it!
Finn:  Thanks, dude.
Fear Feaster:  You've nothing to be proud of, boy! You will never get of your fear of the ocean!
Jake:  Whoa, dude! What's with your bellybutton?
Finn:  [To Fear Feaster] What the flip, man? I just swam to the bottom!
Fear Feaster:  No you didn't, cheater! You just sank to the bottom. You will never be a great hero.
Finn:  He's right. I'll never be a hero.
Wise Man 1:  Finn, you are wrong. The mark of a great hero is his flaw.
Fear Feaster:  You know nothing, Wise Men!
Wise Man 1:  Silence, Fear Feaster! We know a lot!
Finn:  Wait... Why did you wait so long to tell me?
Wise Man 1:  Because the limo driver's flaw is being late!
Limo Driver: Sorry. [rolls up window]
Wise Man 1:  Farewell, Finn. You truly are the greatest hero of Ooo.
Finn:  It's time for you to go away, Fear Feaster!
Fear Feaster:  What? Am I supposed to live in your tummy for the rest of my life?
Finn:  Everybody has a flaw... and it looks like yours is smelling like my nasty guts.
Fear Feaster:  [Sarcastically] Wonderful...
Pat McHale:  And so fear is forced deep within the soul of a hero. Conquered... at least, for now... [Maniacal laugh]
