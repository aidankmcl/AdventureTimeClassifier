Princess Bubblegum:  And so, through my experiments with cloud-seeding, I've invented... liquid pyrotechnics.
Jake:  That's really cool, PB!
Princess Bubblegum:  Aw, thanks, puppy. [Draws Jake onto her lap.]
Jake:  Isn't it cool, Finn?
Finn:  [Stammering] Owwww-guh...
Princess Bubblegum:  [Giggles]
Princess Bubblegum:  Uh, Finn. No. Come on, Finn, don't be weird. Look, I'll see you guys later.
Finn:  Huh? Oh. [Finn and Jake run inside the Tree Fort away from the rain]
Jake:  It's letting up. Hey, Finn, come on, let's go do something.
Finn:  [Sighing]
Jake:  [Whispers] BMO, put on a game.
[BMO turns on a game and Finn begins to sing a song seemingly to its tune: "All Gummed Up Inside"]
Finn:  [Sighs dejectedly]
Jake:  Oh, Finn.... Uncle Jakey's gonna find you a new love interest.
Jake:  Finn, I'm going out for a quick.... walk in the woods.
Finn:  [Makes a pained noise]
Jake:  BMO, you look after him with your camera-eyes.
BMO:  If anyone tries to hurt Finn, I will kill them.
Jake:  Ok, good.
Flambo:  [Screams]
Jake:  Woman!
Jake:  I'll save you, wash tub princess!
Flambo:  [Still screaming]
Jake:  You're safe now, Miss... Flambo?!
Flambo:  Yeah, it's me. [chuckles] Bet you thought I was dame on account of my girlish screamin'.
Jake:  I did think that. [Throws the wash tub]
Flambo:  Haha, well. Thanks, anyway, brother.
Jake:  Hey.... You're pretty plugged-in, Flambo. Do you know any princesses Finn's age?
Flambo:  Oh, yeah. I know just the skirt, ...and she's way hot!
Jake:  She's from Fire Kingdom? I think I'll die if I go in there.
Flambo:  Heh, oh yeah.
Jake:  Ow...
Flambo:  There, I cast Flame Shield on yous. Also I spat on yous.
Jake:  [Angered grunt] BMO-cam on.
Finn [on BMO's camera]:  Gold-darn you, tear ducts! Yah! Yah! [punches himself in the eyes.]
Jake:  Ugh... Hang in there, buddy.
Jake:  [Gasps]
Jake:  [Jake scratches his stomach] Yo! What up? I'm Jake, Jake the [Flambo hits Jake in the gut] Dooug.
Flambo:  [Whispers] Dude, you gotta pretend like you're of royal blood.
Jake:  Could have told me this sooner.
Flambo:  Haha! Yeah.
Jake:  Good morrow, Majesty! [Exclaims] I am Sir Jake, Baron of the Grasslands!
Flame King:  Hmmmmm.... What do you seek? Speak! [Points left hand at Jake.]
Jake:  [Terrified] Uhk-uhg... I come as an envoy of Prince Finn.
Flame King:  A prince?!
Flame People:  [Chattering] A prince! Finn is a prince! Yeah, a prince!
Jake:  Yeah and he's the same age as your daughter. [Points left hand at Flame Princess.]
Flame Princess:  Oooh...
Flame King:  Bold words, but know you that my daughter is a rare jewel. She cannot be wooed by just any ragamuffin prince!
Jake:  Umm.... Oh, Prince Finn is AWESOME!
Flame People:  [Chattering] An awesome prince?! That's the best kind!
Flame King:  Silence, my molten mommas. [Walks closer to Jake] We are perplexed. If you are a baron true, where is your gift? 'Tis common practice among visiting dignitaries.
Flame People:  [Chattering] Yeah, a gift! Where is the gift?!
Flambo:  [Whispers] You're blowin' it, bromite.
Jake:  [Smiles] A gift?! Sire, Prince Finn sent, uh... three gifts! [Shows to hands how many gifts he brought and claps.]
Flambo:  [Surprised] What?!
Flame King:  Hmmmm.... Three is more than one.
Flame People:  [Chattering] Wait a second, three's a lot of gifts! I want three gifts!
Flame Princess:  [Interested] Oooh...
Jake:  The first gift is [looks inside the backpack] um-um-um this water bottle.
Flame Jester:  [Dances like an idiot.] [Groans]
Flame Princess:  [Gasps and scowls]
Flame King:  Prince Finn has smoked my jester! Pourquoi?! ("Why?!") ...I do hate my jester.
Jake:  Uh, Prince Finn hated him too.
Flame Princess:  Hmmm...
Jake:  For your second gift, a, uh... hmmmm oh!
[Jake plays the Fire Guitar and begins to sing a song: "All Warmed Up Inside"]
Flame Princess:  [Applauds and sighs with admiration]
Flame King:  A fire inside my body?! I am disgusted! Give me your third terrible gift and be on your way!
Jake:  [Jake then checks on Finn with BMO's camera.] Oh, Finn, I'm so sorry!
Finn:  [Lets out crying huffs] BMO, go away! [Turns around]
BMO:  [BMO performs a Kancho prank on Finn.] Whoooop.... Duck, Duck, Duck, Goose!
Finn [on BMO's camera]:  [Yelps]
Flame King:  Is that him? He looks terrible! Why isn't he here? Why did he send his buffoon?! Leave now, buffoon, for you have failed!
Jake:  No, wait! Uh-um, [Exclaims] Prince Finn is here! [Stretches his stomach to look like Finn.] He's riiight... here!
Jake [Fake Finn]:  Greetings, Flame King! My final gift is your favorite thing in the world.
Flame King:  A koala bear?
Jake [Fake Finn]:  Uh, yes!
Jake:  [Sounds of concentration]
Jake [Koala]:  Eucalyptus! Eucalyptus!
Flame King:  I don't like koalas anymore. Begone!
Jake [Fake Finn]:  [Begins to cry]
Jake:  Dude, don't cry.
Jake [Fake Finn]:  Can't help it! I'm in love with Bubblegum!
Jake:  She's too old for you.
Jake [Fake Finn]:  [Grabs Jake with both hands on both of Jake's shoulders] I don't care!
Jake:  Come on! Flame Princess seems into you.
Jake [Fake Finn]:  No, no, no! Only Bubblegum!
Jake:  Ouw, Finn! [Fake Finn strangles Jake] Finn, Finn, Finn, Finn stop man....
Jake [Fake Finn]:  Ahh-ahh!
Jake:  [Choking] Fiiiinn. [Then plays dead and inhales]
Flame King:  Excellent!
Jake [Fake Finn]:  Huh?!
Flame King:  You have indeed proven yourself! Any prince ruthless enough to kill his own buffoon would make an excellent boyfriend...
Jake:  [Whispers] Yeah!
Flame King:  ... for my evil daughter!
Jake:  Whaaaat?!
Flame King:  She's an unstoppable force of destruction. Ahhhh, nothing a psycho like you can't handle. Congratulations!
Flame Princess:  I'm so happy! I'm so happy to meet you, Prince. You're my Prince. [Flame Princess embraces Fake Finn.]
Flame People:  [Chattering] That's sweet. That's so sweet.
Jake:  [Whispers] She seems normal.
Flame People:  [Chattering] Yeah, she seems normal.
Flame Princess:  Stop whispering! [Flame Princess transforms to her enraged form and turns the other citizens of the Fire Kingdom into flambits.]
Flambo:  Hey, so that's where I came from.
Jake [Fake Finn]:  You know, on second thought, ...we're not really each other's types.
Flame Princess:  We're... what?
Jake [Fake Finn]:  I changed my mind. I don't like you.
Flame Princess:  You... WHAT?! [Flame Princess transforms again to her enraged form.]
Jake [Fake Finn]:  [Terrified] Uh, nothing. [Jake uses Fake Finn to pick himself up] Bye, Flambo. [Runs for his life]
Jake:  [Panting]
Jake:  Finn! I really messed up.
Jake:  Finn, buddy, you gotta help me. I made a mistake.
Jake:  [Screaming]
Finn:  Who lit that fire?! I'll kill you!
Finn:  [Kicks the window, shattering it] Yaaah! [Finn goes out of the window]
Finn:  [To himself] Bubblegum's rockets! [Yelling at Flame Princess] Don't you touch her stuff!!!
Flame Princess:  [Screams of pain]
Finn:  It's a girl.
Flame Princess:  You! What's wrong with me, huh?! You don't like me?!
Finn:  [Contrary tone] I like you!
Flame Princess:  What's wrong with you?!
Flame Princess:  Don't ever mess with me again!
Finn:  [Looks at Jake] Who was that?
Jake:  [Still terrified] The Princess of the Fire Kingdom?
Finn:  [Looks out the window, then back at Jake] Dude, I think I have a crush.
