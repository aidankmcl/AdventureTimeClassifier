Jake:  You gonna do the thing again?!
Finn:  Yeah, man!
Finn:  Whaaaat?
Jake:  Nice.
Finn:  Hey, Princess Bubblegum. Hey, everybody.
Jake:  [Panting] Man... [Panting] Dancin' is rough!
Finn:  Yeah... I'm havin' some sweat issues here! I'll go get us some snackety-juice.
Jake:  Hey, man. I'm Jake. [The bear doesn't respond.] I'm Jake. [No response] Hmmmm...
Finn:  Check it out, Jake! I got us some peanuts. And punch! [Throws a punch while saying "punch"]
Finn:  [Spits out his peanuts] Choking!! Don't give up on me, man!
Candy Person #24:  Whoa, Finn, nice book.
Finn:  [Casually] Yeah. 'S pretty cool. It's the Enchiridionthe hero's handbook. [To the bear] Hey, guy, you alright? [The bear softly growls.] Haha. He's all good! Everybody get back to your dancin'!
Jake:  Uh, Finn? I think that bear is followin' us home.
Finn:  Whoa. Haha. I think you're right. Hey, bear, you gonna come hang out with us? [The bear comes nearer.] Whaddaya say, bear? [The bear eats a leaf on his fur.] Heh-heh. Awesome.
Jake:  I dunno, Finn. This guy seems kinda weird.
Finn:  Yeah. He's totally weird. Hahaha! [The bear attempts to imitate Finn's laughter.]
Jake:  [Unsure] Mmmmm...
Finn:  Jake! Hey, Jake! [Jake takes off one side of his headphones] Jake!
Jake:  What?
Finn:  Come here! Ya gotta check this out!
Jake:  Eh, okay.
Finn:  Check this out, man. This bear is tops blooby! [Jake rolls his eyes and sighs] Watch this. [Finn inhales and the bear does the same; Finn says, "Choo!" and the bear does the same.] Ya gotta try this, Jake. He does everything I do!
BMO:  [Laughs] Oh, stop! [Finn pulls BMO away.]
Finn:  Haha, come on, Jake, try it!
BMO:  It's awesome!
Jake:  Heh-heh. Um... Yeah, okay. [Grabs a broom and starts sweeping] Sweepy-sweepy-sweepy. Sweep sweep sweep. Sweepin'!
Finn:  [Laughing] He's got me down pat! Heh-hah! Sweeping's weak.
Jake:  [Annoyed] Mmmmmm...
Bear:  Sweeping weak.
Finn:  Whoa! This guy's alright!
Jake:  This guy just busted me up my chops, Finn!
Finn:  Hey, come on, he's just a bear. He don't know nothin'.
Jake:  Mmmm... Yeah, I guess. Well, anyway, it's gettin' pretty late. Probably time for everyone to go back home to their own houses.
Finn:  Yeah, I guess you're right, Jake. It is pretty late. He should probably stay here tonight. [Jake scowls.] [To bear] You can sleep in the bathtub!
Bear:  Braaaathtub.
Finn:  [Laughs] Brathtub, hahaha! This guy's tops blooby!
Bear:  [Claps once] Whaaaat? Hey, Princess Bubblegum. Hey, everybody. [Snaps some more and claps once] Whaaaat? Hey! [Snapping] Hey, Princess Bubblegum! Hey, everybody! [Jake slowly backs away and falls down.] Whaaaat? Hey!
Finn:  What are you doing?!
Jake:  Shhh. Come with me. Ya gotta see somethin'. This bear's wiggy, Finn. It's wearing your clothes and dancin' around all crazy.
Finn:  That sounds rad, man.
Jake:  What?! NoJust! ... Rrrr! [Pulls Finn out of bed]
Jake:  Aw, man! [Finn sighs.] Oh, ya gotta believe me, Finn. I swear, he was, like, all wigged-out, was dancin'... [Desperate noise]
Finn:  ...I do believe you.
Jake:  [Pleasantly surprised] Oh.
Finn:  It's just, y'know, who cares? Dancing, wearing clothes... He ain't hurtin' nobody. He's just doin' it up, y'know? He's just cool, and he likes my style. That ain't a crime.
Jake:  No. [Chuckles] I guess not.
Finn:  Okay. Great. I'm going back to bed. You comin', smart guy?
Jake:  Yeah, okay. [Chuckles]
Jake:  You're not even a little weirded out by this?
Finn & Bear:  [In near unison; Finn is ahead of the bear by a few words]: No, man. He's just doin' his instincts. He's like a parrot or chameleon or something. He's funny!
Finn:  Anyway, I gotta go pick up BMO from soccer. I'll be back soon. And remember: don't eat my special Finn cakes. Finn only.
Jake:  Yeah, I get it. You don't need to tell me that every time you make Finn cakes.
Jake:  Hey, what are you doin'?! [The bear begins eating the cakes.] Why, you little...! Tryin' to set me up, eh? You think you're so smart, but this time, I'm ready. [Pulls out video camera, records bear, and laughs]
Finn:  OH, MY GLOB, WHAT?!?! JAKE! YOU ATE ALL MY FINN CAKES! WHAT THE STINK!
Jake:  Uh, nope. The bear did it, and I've got proof. I taped the whole thing.
Finn:  [His face turns very red with rage] The bear ate all my cakes, and you just sat there and watched him do it?! What's wrong with you?!
Jake:  Ju What?! No, man, he was tryin' to frame me, Finn! He's tryin' to steal your identity! Why can't you grok that?!
Finn:  [Exasperated noise] He's a bear, Jake! He's a wild animal! He doesn't know things! He just does stuff! He's cool!
Jake:  Ohh, fine, then that's just great. Then you and M.C. Cool Friend can go stink it up together at your stupid cool Finn party all by yourself, cause I'm not going!
Finn:  ...Wait. What? What party?
Jake:  What? Your party, man. Tonight? In the woods?
Finn:  [Reading flyer] "Finn'z... bezt... party?" But... I didn't make this flyer.
Jake:  Huh?! Well, who did, then?! [Finn gasps.]
Finn & Jake [In unison]: The bear.
Jake:  ...I knew it.
Jake:  See, dude? He's not just jackin' your style. He's jackin' your whole you! Jackin' yo you up!
Finn:  What the what?
Jake:  He got in close and used you. Now he's feedin' nuts to your ex-girlfriend!
Princess Bubblegum:  [To bear] Sure! I'll have another... [The bear cuts her off by feeding her a peanut] [Muffled] ...peanut.
Finn:  She's not my... [Thinks for a moment] We never went steady.
Jake:  He's trying to replace you, and he's already got everyone convinced he's you! He didn't really like you. [Whispering] He used you.
Bear:  Tops blooby! Tops blooby. Tops [Finn pulls the bear's mask off]
Finn:  Not cool, man. [Everyone stops dancing.] You're not me. You're just a bear acting like me. [The bear starts crying and quickly leaves.] [To everyone else] It's okay, everyone. The imposter is gone.
Princess Bubblegum: Finn... nobody really thought the bear was you.
Finn:  [Saddened] Wait... what?
Princess Bubblegum:  We just thought it was one of your jokey-joke-jokes. [Makes an angry look at Finn and he briefly does the same]
Finn:  Hey! Hey, bear!
Jake:  Wait up, guy!
Finn:  Hey. I... I didn't mean to make you feel so bad about yourself. I'm really sorry about that.
Jake:  Me, too.
Finn:  But... you're a super-rad bear, so... why not just be you?
Bear:  [Crying] I... want... be... hero... like... yooouuuu!
Finn:  [With pity] Awww...
Jake:  I guess he's got a heart of gold after all.
Finn:  Hold on, bear. I got something for ya. It's the Enchiridion, the hero's handbook. Everything you need to know about being a hero is in this book. Take it, and learn.
Jake:  [Whispering] Finn, are you nuts?! We can't give that book away! It's, like, crazy-important!
Finn:  Whatever, man. We never use it, except for, like, sitting on it when the grass is wet and stuff. [To bear] Drink your fill of knowledge. Someday, you'll be a great hero.
Bear:  Thank you, Finn. Thank... yooouuu...
Voice:  Did you bring the book?
Snail [The Lich]: Yessss... One step closer.
