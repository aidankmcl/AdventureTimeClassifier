Alarm Clock Bird:  [Coughs] [Flies out the window]
Snow Golem:  [Yawns]
Snow Golem:  [hums while walking through the forest]
Finn:  Ice King, this the last time you steal our sandwiches!
Ice King:  You don't understand! If you were me, you would do things I would do!
Finn:  Yeah, and if you were us, you'd kick your fat butt!
Ice King:  I ... yeah, I would... but I wouldn't get past my invincible armor!
Finn:  Yaah! [Kicks against armor but causes no damage. Finn falls.]
Ice King:  [Laughs] Not a scratch, boys! Not a scratch! It's my time to shine!
Snow Golem:  [Yelps]
Snow Golem:  [Shouting in fear] Wuuuuh-wuuuh!
Snow Golem:  [hums while he fixes his cart]
Wolf of Fire:  [Barks playfully]
Snow Golem:  [Gets angry]
Wolf of Fire:  [Emanates fire and barks while watching Snow Golem away]
Ice King:  Fools! Fools! You're wasting your ti-yime!
Snow Golem:  [Sighs]
Snow Golem:  [panics] Wuh? Wuuuh-wuuuh! Wuuuh! Wuuuuh! [Manages to put out the fire on his body.] [Calms down and notices that the pup caused the fire.]
Wolf of Fire:  [Barks, turns around and blows a raspberry]
Snow Golem:  Ehh ... [Picks up the pup with a piece of the cart, opens the door and throws him out of his house.] [He shuts the door and opens it again when he hears the pup moaning and shivering from cold. He again closes the door and opens it again, this time seeing some vultures trying to eat the pup.]
Snow Golem:  Wuh! Wuuuh! [Puts out the flames with his hands and removes pup from the kitchen with a branch so that it cannot burn anything.]
Snow Golem:  Hmmm.
Snow Golem:  Wuuuh! Wuuh! [Blows what's left of his finger and tries to ease the pain] Ah! Ahh ... Geesh ... [The pup is sad] ... [mutters reassuringly] Bo, bo, bop [Fixes his finger (again with face) with a snowball and tries to entertain the pup again.]
Snow Golem:  Huh? Wang nyangah yuh?!
Ice King:  [Sleeping] Fools, fools, fools...
Ice King:  [snore] In-ice-able vince armor...
Ice King:  Help! Help! Somebody help me! Ah! Oh, sweet mama!
Finn:  Got you now!
Jake:  Yeah!
Ice King:  Aah! You can have the sandwiches back! I'm sorry! Help!
Snow Golem:  Bye-bye.
Ice King:  Boy, those sandwiches look really cool! [Finn continues eating] It looks like it'd be really awesome to try a bite of one of those [Jake also claims and continues to eat] ... right on, right on.
Snow Golem:  You ... the ... real good. Nice... home.
Finn:  Jake, do you think that puddle needs our help?
Jake:  Nah, it's a Snow Golem, man. I think he's laughing.
Finn:  I thought Snow Golems and Fire Wolves hated each other.
Jake:  Oh, yeah, big time.
Finn:  But they learned to get along.
Jake:  Yup.
Ice King:  You know ... maybe we could all learn a thing or two from those sandwiches.
Ice King:  [Pause] ... Thank you.
