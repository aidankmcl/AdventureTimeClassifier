Finn: Thanks, bro!
Jake: There for you, bro... but Finn, I'm gonna tell you something gently.
Finn: [concerned] Okay. What is it, bro?
Jake: Get a new sword.
Finn: What you do mean?
Jake: Bro, these guys could've hurt you.
Finn: It still works. [swings it] Hyut!
Jake: Bro...
Finn: I love this sword. [hugs it]
Jake: It'll be okay. Let's go shopping!
Suzy & Sue: Candles! Candles! Candles for all occasions!
Jake: Hey! There's Choose Goose! [looks at Finn and runs toward Choose Goose excitedly] Goose! Come on! [realizes that Finn has not moved and runs back to him] Finn? What's wrong?
Finn: Mm, maybe we should try someone else.
Jake: What? But we have history with him--that's important in business.
Finn: Yeah, but we're lookin' for a sword. Remember that armor he sold us? [motions his hands in the shape of an hourglass]
Jake: [winces] Ooh. Yeah, okay.
Jake: I asked around. This is the place to get sa-words. [motions to a grass tipi in front of them]
Finn: Oh. Doesn't look like it's open.
Finn & Jake: Open! [They walk inside.]
Voice: Close the curtains behind you, please.
Voice: Walk towards the candle.
Man: How can I help you?
Finn: Need a sword.
Man: Hold on. [brings out a sword] Here you go: a grass sword. It's a bargain.
Finn: I don't know. I've never used a grass sword before. Maybe we should keep lookin'.
Man: Swords like this don't come around every day.
Finn: Don't come around every day, uh? [wields the sword] I love it.
Jake: Well, that was easy.
Man: [as Finn and Jake walk out] Remember, no take backs.
Jake: Hey, the pillow vendor!
Finn: Huh? Hyut! [slices it in half]
Jake: Huh? Pizza?!
Finn: Yeah! Came outta nowhere! It was gonna bonk you on the head.
Jake: You're getting good with that sword. You were never able to do that with your other swords.
Finn: No more pizza bonks. Hyut! [swishes the sword] Hey, we're near Tree Trunks' house. Let's stop by and get some pie.
Jake: Pie!
Finn: [swishing sword] Hyut! Hyut!
Finn: Hyaaaah!
Tree Trunks: Howdy, boys! Nice pillow and nice sword. My hands are full, Finn. Uh, you mind slicin' an apple for me? [rolls an apple toward him]
Finn: Hyut! [slices apple perfectly]
Tree Trunks: Something is terribly wrong with that awful sword.
Jake: He's gettin' really good. He saved me from pizza.
Tree Trunks: That apple slicing is too perfect... demonically perfect. That sword is cursed!
Finn & Jake: [laugh]
Jake: I like it when Tree Trunks gets all serious.
Jake: Uh, how's that curse doin'? Makin' you want to moidle me? [laughs]
Finn: No, man. This sword doesn't seem to have any curse on it, as far as I can tell. [stabs at the air] Hyah!
Jake: Well, okay. [tries taking the tag off his pillow with his teeth] Dang tag.
Finn: I got it!
Jake: Hmm?
Jake: [gasps]
Finn: Whoa!
Jake: Hey, quit showin' off, bro!
Finn: Sorry, man. I don't know what happened. I-I... I'll go put this away.
Jake: Good idea. [puts the pillow in his bed, gets on top of it, and starts sleeping]
Finn: [screams] [pants] Huh? [unzips sleeping bag, finding the sword in his hand]
Finn: What the--? [pants frantically]
Finn: [sighs] Jeez.
Finn: Stupid... [kicks it] thing! [It falls into the river below.] Worst three bucks I've ever spent.
Finn: [gasps] [looks at his arm, seeing no sword] Whew.
Finn: [shrieks]
Jake: What's goin' on?
Finn: The sword is after my flesh!
Jake: Huh?
Jake: Oh, snap!
Finn: Don't let it get me, Jake!
Jake: Don't worry. I'll handle this. [wraps his apron around the sword's hilt and sheathes it in a baguette] There.
Finn: [sighs] Let's go return that junk.
Jake: Huh. Hey, he's not here.
Finn: Hmm. Maybe someone around here knows where he is.
Finn: Somebody in trouble!
Suzy & Sue: Help! They're taking our candles!
Jake: It's the Hooligans Who Love Candles!
Finn: Let's get 'em! [drops his pack and sword] Hey!
Hooligans carrying candle: Huh?
Hooligan: Yo! You got a prob, Bob?
Finn: Stealing candles from old ladies is immoral! [punches them] [kicks another in the face]
Another hooligan: Anarchy! [throws candle at Finn]
Finn: [catches it and throws it back] School! [kicks him] Hyah!
Hooligans: Aah! Stop chasing us!
Hooligan: Happy birthday. [bashes Finn's head with candle]
Hooligan: [brandishing candle] You're dead, teddy boy.
Finn: No.
Suzy & Sue: You've saved our shop!
Sue: Thank you so much, you brave young man.
Suzy: And don't even worry about the damages.
Sue: We'll just use the broken pieces to build a life-sized candle in your likeness.
Suzy: Oh, and we'll put it right by the entrance, and it'll be our mascot--the candle man!
Jake: Dude... [winces]
Finn: Yeah... not comin' off.
Jake: Don't give up, man. Hey, maybe Choose Goose knows where the old man went.
Jake: Hey, Choogles! We need your help. We gotta find the dude who sold us this cursed sword. You know who he is?
Choose Goose: I know you did business with some rando guy. Help you backstabbers--Why should I?
Jake: What? Come on, Choogie, it was only one time.
Choose Goose: Hmm.
Finn: I made a mistake, CG. This merch is totally defective. [earnestly] Please.
Choose Goose: Okay-dokay... I know that quack with the grassy shack. He's a wizard from the grassy plain. He lives atop the grassy moun... tayn.
Jake: Awesome. Wizard of Grassy Moun-tayn... Mountain. Yeah, thanks, Choogs.
Finn: Yeah, thanks!
Choose Goose: [shouting after them] He's the only one who can lift the curse, but beware...
Choose Goose: He's a huge ding-wad--just the worst.
Finn: Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop!
Jake: [screams]
Finn: Hmm. For a cursed dingus, you cut so good.
Finn: Come forth, wizard, and uncurse my mitt! Grassy Mountain Wizard!
Grassy Wizard: Comin' up here tryin' to enter my house! Are you for real?! [uses his powers to bring out his household objects made of grass] Mow 'em down, my cursed grassy objects! [sends them flying through the air toward Finn and Jake]
Finn: Hyah! [slices all the objects while running toward the wizard]
Grassy Wizard: Uh... go forth! Go... uh, forth. [looks inside his house] That was all my grassy objects.
Finn: [points his sword at the wizard] Lift the curse.
Grassy Wizard: [laughs] Never! You have no power over me, young fool! The grass sword will be part of you for all eternity! [laughs]
Finn: [contemplates for a moment] Hmm. You know what? [backs off from wizard] I think I'm cool with that.
Grassy Wizard: What?
Finn: Whoa. [laughs] [extends and retracts his sword a few times]
Jake: Now that you've accepted it, you can control it!
Finn: [extends it] Yeah. [retracts it] This is really cool! [extends it] I just had to get used to it. [retracts it]
Grassy Wizard: That's not how people are supposed to react to an eternal curse!
Finn & Jake: Whatevs.
Jake: [laughs] Do it again! [laughs]
