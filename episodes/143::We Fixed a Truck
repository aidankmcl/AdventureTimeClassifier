Finn: JAKE, WAKE UP! I FOUND A TRUCK!
Jake: [opens an upstairs window] What?
BMO: What's happening?
Jake: Whoa! [picks up BMO and stretches them down to Finn] Where did ya get this baby? [rubs truck]
Finn: I found it in the woods. I named it "Hot Daniel." Anyway, I figured we could do some pretty sick stuff with it.
Jake: Oh, yeah? Like what?
Finn: Hmm. I don't know. Launch it off some ramps, maybe get it going thirty miles per hour, crank the wheel into a gnar right-hander, spray dirt everywhere like a big hurkin' dirt wave?
Jake: Yeah, buddy! [gives thumbs up] Nice! Let's crank this beast up.
Finn: Can't--engine's busted, I think.
Jake: Nuts. BMO, you know anything about cars?
BMO: Nope.
Finn: Hmm. Maybe... [shouts to upstairs window] Ice King, you know anything about cars?
Ice King: Nope. Not a car guy--too confusing. Got better things to do with my life.
Finn: Hmm.
Jake: Wait... I know someone who's good with mechanics.
Banana Man: Hey! Hey, guys! Hi!
Jake: Hey, Banana Man.
Banana Man: Wow! I haven't seen you fellas since you destroyed my home, my land, and my rocket.
Finn: Aw, jeez, yeah. Sorry, Banana Man--just sorta happened.
Banana Man: Don't worry about it! Feh! Bygones! I'm just excited you called me over. We're neighbors. We should help each other out. I got the soda and the jams.
Finn, Jake, & BMO: Cool!
Banana Man: [opens hood] I see the problem. The top of your engine is gone, specifically, the cylinder head.
Finn: Hm. Okay. That word sounds cool... but what does it mean?
Banana Man: Let me explain. [backs up as the background changes to a diagram] The cylinder head is the top to the cylinder block. [points to cylinder head] Think of the cylinder head as an airtight lid to your engine that regulates air, fuel, and exhaust.
Finn: Okay. Cool. Informative. [whispers to Jake] What is he pointing at?
Banana Man: Now this lid is important because it works to get fuel into your engine. [clears throat] You see, your engine has cylinders, and these cylinders are pistons. When the piston in the cylinder moves down, it creates a vacuum, pulling in fuel from the intake.
BMO: You mean an air-fuel mixture?
Banana Man: That's right, BMO. [puts a sticker on it] Have a gold star, dear.
BMO: Yay! BMO is so pretty and smart!
Banana Man: Then the piston returns to the top, compressing the air-fuel mixture. Then a spark plug fires off, creating an explosion, driving the piston back down, powering the engine. [clears throat]
Finn: Sweet. So where's the cylinder head, then?
Banana Man: Hmm. Well, sometimes people store parts they're working on in the car. [walks over to the bed of the truck and finds the part] Ah! Bingo! [brings it to Finn and Jake] Found it.
Finn: Yeah! Drive time!
Banana Man: Well... n-not quite. We don't know why they took the cylinder head off. Uh, it could be cracked, the gasket head could be warped, the rod bearings could have damage from water--you see, that's the cool thing about cars. [clears throat] One tiny little thing messes everything else up so nothing works! So it's up to us to figure it out!
Finn: Cool.
Jake: Yeah, alright.
Jake: Whoo. I'm bushed. You guys wanna pick this up again in the mornin'?
Finn: Sure.
Banana Man: Sounds good!
BMO: Not BMO. This grease monkey's torqued up on automotive styles. [crush can on head] Yeah, [throws can] boyee!
Finn: Okay, BMO. Good night, Banana Man.
Banana Man: Have a good evening, gents.
BMO: Time for the night shift. [turns on blowtorch]
Starchie (on radio): It's ten past the hour, and this is Graveyard Shift, hosted by me, Starchie the Gravedigger, your weekly five-hour dose of all the strange haints, phantasmagoria, and phenomena I see working in the Candy Kingdom Graveyard. Hello, caller. You're on the Graveyard Shift.
Banana Guard (on radio): What? Am I--oh, hi! Um, longtime listener, first-time caller. So, uh, I think Princess Bubblegum has been replaced by, like, a lizard person.
BMO: A lizard? [starts drawing a picture]
Banana Guard: Yeah, a lizard. I love your show.
Starchie: Oh, Starchie is very interested in this topic. What led you to this discovery, caller?
BMO: [laughs] They are wrong! You look more like a hippo than a lizard.
Banana Guard: Well, um, my friend is a very highly-placed official in the Candy Kingdom, and I've noticed--
Banana Man: Hi, BMO.
BMO: [yelps] Stay back, lizard!
Banana Man: Sorry, BMO. I-I didn't mean to startle you. I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the truck... and biodiesel! Oh, and I figured out what's wrong with the engine block. So what are you working on?
BMO: Aerodynamics.
Banana Man: Swe-e-e-et! You know, it's been really nice hanging with you fellas and working on the car. [pats the roof of the truck] It gets a little lonely at my space-age banana dome.
BMO: You don't have a girlfriend?
Banana Man: No. I-I don't want to be alone, but... I've gotten pretty good at it. I putter around the house, keeping busy with my little projects. But it would be nice to find someone.
Starchie: Hold up. Princess? Is that you? [click] Ah, spooky.
Finn: Yo, BMO. Coffee.
BMO: Thank you. ["drinks" it]
Finn: Car looks nice, BMO.
Jake: Yeah.
Banana Man: [snores] [wakes up] Uh! Ah! I fixed it! Are we best friends yet?! Oh. Oh, hey. I-I fixed it.
Finn: [gives thumbs up] N-i-i-i-i-i-ice.
Banana Man: I discovered the cylinder head was warped so I went to the junkyard and got a new one. [brings it out] Bingo.
Finn: Whoo.
Jake: Biodiesel.
Finn, Jake, BMO, and Banana Man: Yeah!
Finn: Awesome!
Banana Man: [laughs] [sees a female Banana Guard] Yow-ee-wow. [stops truck] She's beautiful.
Jake: Well, then go over and talk to her.
BMO: Yeah, come on, Banana Man! You're lonely!
Banana Man: Oh, no, that's okay. Having someone to love takes up time I could use to work on stuff.
Jake: That's the craziest thing I ever heard. [stretches his arm to the wheel and his foot to the gas pedal and drives the truck over to the guard] Pardon me, miss. My friend here is super smart, and he rebuilt this truck.
BMO: He's very smart and very single!
Female Banana Guard: [uncertainly] Okay...
Jake: Anyway, his name is Banana Man. If you like what you see, give him a call.
Female Banana Guard: [growls angrily]
Princess Bubblegum: He-e-e-elp m-e-e-e-e-e-e!
Finn: We gotta save Bubblegum!
BMO: No, Finn! She's a lizard!
Jake: You gotta stop listening to all those conspiracy shows. [twists his head] They twist up your noodle so you can't tell what's real.
Finn: Look, there she is!
Jake: [picks up Princess Bubblegum and places her in the bed of the truck] You want some tea?
Princess Bubblegum: [pants] Sure!
Princess Bubblegum: Thanks, Jake.
Finn: So, what's up with the angry mob, PB?
Princess Bubblegum: Oh, they think I've been replaced with an evil lizard replicant. It's sheer nonsense.
BMO: [holding a bug] Eat this bug!
Finn, Jake, & BMO: [scream]
Lizard: [roars] [starts destroying the Princess Bubblegum's castle]
Finn: [turns the car around] Punch it, 'Nana Man!
Princess Bubblegum: [comes out of a manhole and sees Jake bouncing by] What the fridge?
Princess Bubblegum: Finn, Jake! Reptilian synthoid replicants are trying to take over the kingdom!
Finn: Yeah. We know.
BMO: Kill it!
Princess Bubblegum: No, no! I'm the real one!
BMO: [crosses arms] Hmm...
Female Banana Guard: Hey, speedy. [pokes Banana Man with staff] You're comin' with me.
Banana Man: What? Really?
Female Banana Guard: Mm-hmm... 'cause you ain't got enough peel on that 'nanner! You're under arrest for public indecency!
Jake: Bye, Banana Man!
BMO: [cries] It's not fair!
Princess Bubblegum: It's okay, BMO. It's a very mild offense.
BMO: It's not like that! Hot Daniel is dead!
