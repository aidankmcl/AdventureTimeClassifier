Rag Wizard:  Faster!
Rag Wizard:  Faster! She's in danger!
Jake:  Who is he talking about?
Finn:  I have no idea.
Jake:  What?! Then why am I running so hard?
Finn:  Because...
Rag Wizard:  Because she's in trouble!
Finn and Jake:  Who is?!
Rag Wizard:  Marceline!
Finn:  Faster, Jake!
Jake:  She's in trouble! [runs faster]
Jake:  Hey, wizard, how do you know Marceline?
Rag Wizard:  I'm her spirit animal.
Jake:  Oh.
Finn: [gasp] Marceline! What's wrong with her?
Rag Wizard:  She accidentally cast a sleep spell on herself, and now she's trapped in eternal slumber.
Finn:  Tell us how to break the spell.
Rag Wizard:  I'll transport you into Marceline's mind where you will walk through her memories and find the memory core.
Jake:  Then what?
Rag Wizard:  Find the memory of Marceline casting the sleep spell on herself. At your touch, you and the memory will be transported back to reality.
Jake:  But, like, if you know all this, why not just do it yourself?
Rag Wizard:  Entering a person's mind can be dangerous, and I don't have any arms. Just legs. [stretches leg towards Finn] Yeah, there we go... oh. [jabs Finn's forehead with toe]
Finn:  What? What'd you do to my forehead?
Rag Wizard:  When you get close to the memory, your forehead will glow. Here, take this. [gives Finn a sack] It's a sack of magic powder. Sit on the couch and sprinkle the powder on your head.
Finn:  Like this? [sprinkles powder on himself and Jake]
Rag Wizard:  Yep, like that. Feel sleepy?
Finn and Jake:  Mmhm.
Rag Wizard:  Good. Sleep now. But know this! If you fail, Marceline will be trapped in eternal sleep... forever!
Finn and Jake:  [gasp]
Rag Wizard:  And ever. And ever.
Jake:  [yawns] Did it work?
Finn: [rubs eyes] Ugh, ah. I can't tell. I don't feel like I'm inside Marceline's memories.
Jake:  Me neither. Huh?
Jake:  Whoa. Whoa!
Finn:  So... if we're in Marceline's memories, where's Marceline?
Jake:  Hmm... there she is! [walks up to young Marceline] Hey, little Marcy.
Young Marceline:  Who are you guys?
Finn:  We're Finn and Jake.
Jake:  We're your friends!
Young Marceline:  Hambo is my only friend. See? [holds up Hambo] You need another eyeball surgery, pal. Lucky for you, we found a donor. [rips button from shirt] Eyeball! Nurse, hand me the string. Yes, doctor. It's our last piece. Hold still. [stitches button into Hambo] I'm hurting you because I love you.
Jake:  Ahem!
Young Marceline:  What are you guys still doing here?
Finn:  We're trying to wake you up.
Jake:  Do you know where your memory core is?
Young Marceline:  Nope, but there might be anything behind that cellar door, and it rhymes with memory core!
Jake:  Ooo! Ooo! Could be jams and pickles down there!  [opens door] Weird. I think this door leads to a new memory; with food in it! Ooo, ice cream
Finn:  I want some! Huh? [Finn and Jake enter Marceline's room while she is picking her nose]
Jake:  [opens new door] Come on, Finn!
Finn:  Yo, man.
Hunson Abadeer:  Wha?
Finn: Don't eat those.
Hunson Abadeer: Marceline!
Teenage Marceline:  [sniffling] Daddy, why?
Finn:  It's our treehouse. This must be when Marceline lived here.
Marceline:  I'm so glad we're doing this, Ash.
Ash:  Yeah, me too. Oh, hey, wait. Watch this--I've been practicing. [summons rose]
Rose:  Marceline! I love, I love.
Ash:  [giggles]
Jake:  Who's this guy supposed to be?
Finn:  Ash, I guess.
Marceline:  [sighs]
Finn:  [sniffs] This place reeks.
Jake:  Yo, man, your thing is glowing.
Finn:  My what? [touches forehead] Oh, my thing.
Jake:  We must be close to the core. I see another door over there. Come on.
Finn:  Wait a sec, Jake. It's that guy again.
Ash:  Hey, open your eyes, look at this, Mar-Mar. Check it out. It's my new wand. [holds a flower with four cherry blossoms] These cherry blossoms, look, look as close as you can, and they're real.
Marceline:  [puts a finger near a cherry blossom and gets zapped] Wow. Awesome. Where'd you get the money for that thing?
Ash: Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much. To a Witch.
Marceline:  You what? Are you crazy? That was my favorite thing in the whole world!
Ash:  That's why it's so valuable, genius--for potions.
Cherry Blossom Ghost:  You're not, a genius. You're not, a genius.
Marceline: [crying] That's the last straw, Ash! That's it! You're a psycho jerk, and you ruined my life.
Ash:  But--but not all of it!
Marceline:  IT'S OVER, YOU PSYCHO!! [stomps out of the room]
Jake: This way, Finn! Check out this whacked out memory crack! It's ba-nay-nay down here!
Finn:  The core!
Jake:  All these orbs must be her memories.
Finn:  How are we supposed to know which one to grab?
Jake:  Play hot-cold with your forehead!
Finn:  Alright. [moves along the memory core] Hot or cold?
Jake:  Cold. Definitely cold.
Jake:  Warmer. Warmer, warmer! Whoa, hot. Hot, hot, hot! That must be the one!
Finn:  [wakes up] Huh? Hey, you have arms.
Ash:  That's right, genius.
Jake:  Huh?
Finn: You lied to us.
Ash:  The important thing is... Marceline's awake. [magically beams Marceline awake]
Finn:  Marcie, Marcie! You're okay.
Marceline:  Quit touching my hair!
Finn:  You had a magic accident, and we saved you with some help from your wizard friend.
Marceline:  That's Ash.
Finn and Jake:  Ash?
Marceline:  He's not my friend; he's my boyfriend.
Finn and Jake:  What?!
Ash:  That's right, babe.
Marceline:  Ash, what's going on?
Ash:  Just picking up my girl for a night on the town; at my place.
Marceline:  That's sweet. [kisses Ash on the cheek]
Finn and Jake:  What?!
Marceline:  Oh, grow up you guys. I'm going to go freshen up.
Ash:  That's a relief.
Marceline:  Oh, Ash.
Finn:  What?
Ash:  Don't you guys get it? I outbrained you. That wasn't the memory of a sleep spell you brought me. That memory was our break-up!
Marceline:  [in memory orb] It's over, you psycho!! [orb is popped by Ash]
Ash:  That's enough of that?
Jake:  Oh, no!
Finn:  What?
Ash:  Yup. Come on, Mar-Mar, let's go.
Finn:  No, Marceline!
Ash:  Ashicus Flyicus. [flies away with Marceline]
Finn:  They're gone, man. He took her!
Jake:  Don't worry, Finn! I got the scent. [sniffs] Ah. Follow me.
Jake:  I could smell them in there. So what's the plan?
Finn:  Um. Okay, you take that shovel and keep banging it against that shed until Ash comes out to see what's happening. Then I'll sneak in, and I'll rescue Marceline.
Jake:  [fist bumps Finn] Nice. [bangs shovel against shed and Tiny Goblin comes out]
Tiny Goblin:  My house! What's happening? No, don't hurt me!
Jake:  No, no, sorry.
Tiny Goblin: [screams]
Jake:  Shh, shh, wait!
Tiny Goblin:  Help, somebody help me!
Ash:  [bursting out his front door] What's all this hullabaloo?!
Tiny Goblin: Help! Help!
Ash:  Hey, hold it, you, get back here! [chases after Jake]
Marceline:  Finn? Finn, what are you doing? You can't be here! Ash doesn't like me hanging out with mere mortals.
Finn:  Yeah, okay. Sorry Marceline, I'll go. I just gotta show you something first.[shows Marceline sack of magic powder]
Marceline:  Hello? Finn?
Finn:  Hey, there you are. [closes door]
Marceline:  Finn, what's going on? What is this place?
Finn:  It's my old house. That magic powder--it put you in my memories. Me and Jake were in yours before, but Ash tricked us into stealing your memory of you breaking up with him. But it's okay because I saw the memory. Now I have a memory of your memory in my memory. See? [holds memory orb to Marceline]
Ash:  [memory orb] Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much. To a witch.
Marceline: [in memory orb] It's over, you psycho!!
Marceline:  Finn, I think I'd like to wake up now.
Finn:  You gonna be okay, Marceline?
Marceline:  Yeah. Thanks, Finn, I...
Ash:  Yo, Mar-Mar. WhatWhat's with the chump? C'mon, I said no chumps. [pats his belly] Ash gets hungies at eight o' clock. You need to get back in the kitchen and make me din-ner.
Marceline:  [angrily grunts with a scowl]
Ash:  I want a turkey sandwich with to-ma-to.
Marceline: [grunts once more]
Ash:  Also pickles.
Ash: [groaning] Ohh...I can't see...Somebody call my mom!
