Jake:  This stinks! Hey, how much longer till we get to the mysterious party?
Finn:  Let me check the spooky invite sent to us by our anonymous host. [Takes letter out from his jacket] Oh. We're here. The party's in that castle.
Finn:  It's for us!
Jake:  What's it say?
Finn:  [Reading card] Wear me.
Finn and Jake:  Wear me? [Jake opens the box and they both whistle.]
Finn:  Hello?
Princess Bubblegum:  Yoo-hoo! [Camera pans to the left to show Princess Bubblegum, Lumpy Space Princess, BMO and Cinnamon Bun, all wearing masks as well.] Hey guys!
Finn:  Princess Bubblegum, is that you?
Princess Bubblegum:  Why yes indeed. Although according to the invitation, we're supposed to use mystery names. And mine is Lady Quietbottom.
Lumpy Space Princess:  My name is Duchess Gummybuns.
BMO:  I am Professor Pants.
Cinnamon Bun:  I'm Cinnamon Bun.
Lumpy Space Princess:  What's the name on your invite?
Cinnamon Bun:  Oh yeah! Uh... It's Guy Farting.
Finn:  Prince Hotbod, at your service. [Bows]
Jake:  I'm Randy Butternubs. [Walks away and throws card on ground]
Finn:  So... who's our host, anyway?
Princess Bubblegum:  Nobody knows!
Lumpy Space Princess:  Maybe he'll be a steaming hot babe with huge money.
Jake:  Tut-tut, Lumpy Space Princess! What would your boyfriend Brad say?
Lumpy Space Princess:  Brad and I broke up a long time ago, duh!
Cinnamon Bun:  Now's my chance!
Lumpy Space Princess:  No. Way.
Cinnamon Bun:  But I can make you happy!
Lumpy Space Princess:  [Smacks his hand away] Puke off! [Slaps him in the face] You big donut!
Cinnamon Bun:  Okay. [Gets off couch and walks over to a painting, revealing an envelope taped to his back]
Princess Bubblegum:  Excuse me, Guy Farting, there's an envelope on your back.
Cinnamon Bun:  [Struggling to reach it] Where? Where?
Finn:  Here. Let me. [Walks over and takes it off him]
Princess Bubblegum:  [To everyone] Did you put that enevlope on him?
Jake:  No.
Lumpy Space Princess:  No. I didn't do it, no.
BMO:  No. Uh-Uh.
Princess Bubblegum:  What's it say, Prince Hotbod?
Finn:  [Clears throat and reads note] Esteemed guests, I am your host. I am a ghost.
Finn:  By the time you finish reading this, I will posses one of you and use your body to murder everyone in the house.
Cinnamon Bun:  We gotta get out of here! [Runs to the door.]
Finn:  CB, wait! It says anyone who will try to leave will die!
Cinnamon Bun:  Nonononononono! [Pulls door handle]
Lumpy Space Princess:  He's DEAD!!!
Jake:  Yeaaaaah, right.
Finn:  Whad'ya mean "Yeaaaah, right"?
Jake:  [Walks over to Cinnamon Bun's skeleton] Come on. You don't remember when I pulled the same trick on your birthday? [Picks up Cinnamon Bun's skull.] I used the fake skeletons. [Makes Cinnamon Bun's mouth move the same time he is speaking.] To make you think everyone was dead.
Princess Bubblegum:  It looks real to me.
Jake:  [Blows small raspberry] Classic move.
Finn:  Dude. [He pushes up his mask and crosses an arm across chest] I swear I'm not pranking you. Cinnamon Bun is dead.
Finn:  The question is: who killed him?
Finn:  One of us is possessed by a murderer. And if we want to stay alive, we have to figure out who's hiding a ghost inside their mortal body.
Finn:  BMO! [Points down at BMO]
BMO:  Ahh!
Finn:  Use your ghost detecting equipment to screen everyone.
Lumpy Space Princess:  I blinked by balls. My eye balls.
BMO:  Hmmm... [Narrows eyes suspiciously.]
Jake:  What do you mean "Hmmm?"
BMO:  Nothing...
Finn:  Did you see that? [Whispers indistinctly]
Princess Bubblegum:  [Whispers indistinctly]
Lumpy Space Princess:  Oh it was Jake I knew it, I knew it was Jake.
BMO:  Processing... Data! [Prints pictures from its bottom.]
Lumpy Space Princess:  Ew.
Finn:  Huh?
Princess Bubblegum:  So who's the ghost, BMO?
BMO:  Oh. Um... I don't have a ghost detecting equipment. [Slides photos inside of him.] I just like taking nice pictures.
Jake:  Let's find some candles. If the lights go out again, we'll be able to catch the murderer!
Finn:  Good idea! Jake and BMO, you check downstairs and we'll take this floor.
Jake:  Okay.
Jake:  Lay truth on me BMO, is Finn pulling some elaborate prank on me?
BMO:  No, Jake. When bad things happen, I know you want to believe they are a joke. [Its light goes out.] But sometimes, life is scary, and dark. That is why we must find the light. Aha! [BMO finds a box of glow sticks and cracks one.] Found it!
Jake:  Ooh! [Laughs maniacally.] Thanks, BMO! BMO?
BMO:  Help!
BMO:  Jake help!
Jake:  BMO?
Jake:  AHHH! [Runs back up the stairs to the foyer.] Oh my crease! Oh my crease! Assemble! Reassemble! Come on you guys!
Finn:  Where's BMO?
Jake:  The ghost got 'im!
Finn:  Don't you mean you got 'im- [Picks up Princess Bubblegum and throws her from the upstairs balcony, onto a couch on the first floor. Princess Bubblegum rolls off the couch and Finn jumps down onto it.] Ghost!
Princess Bubblegum:  Guys, if there really is a ghost killer, then we should stay in a group. He can't take us all on if we're in a group!
Princess Bubblegum:  LSP, are you okay? Where are you?
Jake:  [worried] It sounds like she's in there! [Points to a door behind them.]
Lumpy Space Princess:  I'm DYING!
Lumpy Space Princess:  [of relief] Ahhh!
Lumpy Space Princess:  Ugh, gross. My lumping body's all hollow now, I gotta put something in it.
Lumpy Space Princess:  So where's the food? What kind of castle is this? It's like a poor people's castle! With no lumping waffles for my dump truck! [Picks up belly and drops it on the table.]
Jake:  Chill out, girl. [to Finn] You find any candles upstairs?
Finn:  No.
Jake:  Well, I dropped a lighter downstairs, but there's no way I'm going back for that.
Finn:  Uh-huh. [He pulls out the invitation.] Let me remind y'all that the invite says that the ghost will possess one of our bods.
Lumpy Space Princess:  [offscreen] Not my bod.
Jake:  Someone at this table isn't who they appear to be!
Finn:  [suspicious] That's right, [finger quotes] "Jake."
Finn:  So let me ask you a question only the real Jake could answer. Who is always next to me in my recurring elevator dreams?
Jake:  [matter-of-factly] A half-orc shaman.
Finn:  [convinced] Okay, you're Jake. So, who else was absent when BMO got nabbed?
Lumpy Space Princess:  Oh yeah, right! I'm not the ghost! I was in the potty house.
Finn:  A convenient alibi. But tell me this...
Jake:  [interrupting] Why did you break up with Brad? Only the real LSP would know that!
Lumpy Space Princess:  Shah! As if you even know the answer to that, Jake!
Jake:  You're right. I'm just feeling gossipy and I wanna know what happened.
Lumpy Space Princess:  IT'S NONE OF YOUR LUMPING BUSINESS!
Finn:  Sounds suspicious. [pointing at Lumpy Space Princess] I bet you're the ghost!
Princess Bubblegum:  She did it! She's possessed! Tie her up!
Finn:  Oh she is, huh? Well, before we tie up LSP, answer me this...
Lumpy Space Princess:  [interrupting] Brad, he kissed me on the mouth! And I was like 'bleh-bleh-bleh', and then I was like 'Uh, gross. Go away, Brad' and he was like 'obviously you're not ready for me' but what does that even mean you guys? W-What does it lumping mean? [Lumpy Space Princess whimpers]
Finn:  [After a short awkward silence; continuing to Princess Bubblegum] But answer me this, Princess...
Lumpy Space Princess:  [interrupting again] What do you want from me, Brad?! You said I was the hottest one, isn't that enough?! [Nearly gibberish] Why'd you have to ...my mouth! [Lumpy Space Princess begins sobbing.]
Finn:  [After another pause; to Princess Bubblegum] What did I write to you on your Happy Birthday card two years ago? Word for word.
Princess Bubblegum:  [flatly] Finn, there's no way I would remember that...
Finn:  [hurt] I remember that. [Pulls down mask]
Jake:  [accusing] You're not PB! Tie you up!
Princess Bubblegum:  [shocked] What! Wait you guys! [Jake stretches his arms around Princess Bubblegum. She looks up, gasps and points] Look!
Finn:  [surprised] A real ghost?!
Lumpy Space Princess:  [scared] Aah! Don't touch me! Don't touch ME!
Finn, Jake and Lumpy Space Princess:  DAAAAAG!
Finn:  [breaking up] This wasn't supposed to... ha-a-appen!
Jake:  Aha! [taps Finn's face] I knew you were pranking me back, you!
Finn:  Yeah... it was all a set up. The doors, Cinnamon Bun's and BMO's. Oh strizz! BMO and Cinnamon Bun should be in the closet over there. [Finn goes towards the closet] Guys! Guys, guys! C'mon you guuuu-.
Lumpy Space Princess:  [shrieking] OH MY GLOB! I can't take this, you guys. [she pulls out her cellphone] I'm calling my lumping parents right now!
Finn:  LSP! What's happening!
Lumpy Space Princess:  Oh my Glob! I'm not ready! Get away! [It wraps itself around Lumpy Space Princess] Oh, gross!
Finn:  Where'd did she GO?!
Jake:  [turning and noticing the painting] Look! [Finn walks over.] [whispering] I'm scared, bro.
Jake:  RUN, HOMIE, RUN!
Finn:  Open it!
Jake:  It won't open! [He taps the door with his left hand, enlarges his right and punches the door. He then holds his hand in pain.]
Finn:  [getting up and running up the stairs] C'mon!
Jake:  [groggily] Okay...
Finn:  Jake!
Jake:  [hopping in pain] Ow, ow, ow! I got a splinter!
Finn:  Jakey!
Jake:  Don't let go, man!
Finn:  Oh no! Your fancy GLOVES!
Finn:  [breathing heavily] Jake... Princess!
Finn:  [shrieking] YEEAAARGH!
Jake:  [removing the white sheet covering him sitting on Lady Rainicorn 's head.] Haha! Gotcha, dude! Two for two!
Finn:  WHAT!?
Jake:  I figured out your plan months ago! So I flipped the script. Oh yeah!
Finn:  So everyone's okay. [counting on fingers] BMO, Cinnamon Bun...
Jake:  Yeah, see?!
Finn:  Whoa, sick! You can phase people into your body?!
Lady Rainicorn:  dangyeonhaji! nan jeikeurang hangsang han momi doeneunde. ("Of course. Jake and I merge our bodies all the time.")
Lumpy Space Princess:  [whispering] I'm ready for you now, Brad. Isn't it so obvi? I'm so ready.
Finn:  [to Princess Bubblegum] But, PB. You melted!
Princess Bubblegum:  It was a wax dummy, dummy! Jake switched me out while Lady was distracting you.
Finn:  [awed] Wow, you got me again! I can't believe that! With the hair, and the house coming alive and stuff...
Jake:  The what?
Finn:  The walls and chairs trying to eat me and stuff.
Jake:  Eh, nah. You must have been so scared you imagined that part.
Finn:  [adamant] Uh, no I didn't...
Jake:  Haha, nice try, Finn. Let's get outta here.
Finn:  That one's going in the vault. [he puts a hand to his head] Aaaaand... It's gone.
