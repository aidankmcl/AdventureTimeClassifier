Bear:  Dark times are coming.
Old Lady:  You talk like justice, Billy, [in a taunting tone] but you can't kick a plaaaaaannnne.
Finn:  [startled] AHHHH!!!!! [falls off of his bed] Whoa!!!!!!!!
Jake:  You alright, buddy? Another nightmare?
Finn:  Yeah. That dang snail again, man... Muckin' it up again. But... there were other guys this time, too. The bear was there, and some dogs, and Billy's lady, and Billy... and Billy was real scared of somethin' fierce, man. Somethin' real fierce! ...And the Cosmic Owl was there, too--kinda--screechin' it up.
Jake:  Whoa, the Cosmic Owl? What if that was a premonition dream, Finn?
Finn:  You think?
Jake:  Could be... We better go tell Billy about it just in case. He'll know what to do.
Finn:  Dang... Whoa...
Jake:  I dreamed I was in kindergarten again, but I had really big feet and was also the teacher.
Jake:  Come on! We better hurry!
Finn:  Hello? [Finn dismounts Jake, who takes his normal dog form] Billy?? [They both run further into Billy's crack where Billy is sleeping on top of his TV]
Jake:  BILLY!!! WAKE UP!!!!
Billy: [Wakes up, clearly agitated] Huh!? WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU GUYS DOIN IN MY CRACK?! It's THREE O' CLOCK IN THE MORNING!
Finn:  Oh, you know, just drop by to say hello... See what you been uhhhhhh [searching for words] up to? What Uhhhh...How are these days?
Jake:  We came to see if you were dead!
Billy:  What? Why would I be dead?!
Finn:  Hehehehe... Yeah..... Stupid.... Um....? I had a dream about a bear, and an old lady, and a snail, and you were there, and the snail killed you... or something...
Billy:  Was the Cosmic Owl there?
Finn:  Uhhh... Yeah! On TV! Does that count?
Billy:  Your dream is an ill omen of GRAVE significance.
Billy:  Finn?
Finn:  Yeah?
Billy:  Are you ready to come with me on a mission to save all life from the Lich?
Finn:  Yes.
Finn:  Wait... So... We have to snatch gems out of all the crowns of power?
Billy:  That's right.
Jake:  [Squinty-eyed] Cool!
Finn:  Why do we have to snatch them? Can't we just ask them for 'em?
Billy:  No time. The fate of the world hangs in the balance.
Finn:  Oh yeah... I forgot.
Jake:  You sure that's a gem?
Finn:  I think so...
Finn:  [Visibly grossed out] So deep...
Jake:  Gross....
Jake:  Man, we got so many gems, it's crazy! Hey Billy, how many gems we still need to get? Two? One?
Jake:  Wait... Two? Or One?
Jake:  Hmm...
Finn: [after munching on his sandwich] I want candy! [Climbs into Billy's sack] You got anything in the saddlebag?
Billy:  GET OUT OF THERE!
Finn:  The Enchiridion? How'd ya get this?!
Billy:  I found it in the mouth of a bear.
Finn:  A bear?
Billy:  This book is REALLY important[Finn blushes in embarrassment, having given the book away previously to a wild animal] It has magical powers. Turn the little sword sideways.
Finn: [Pleasantly surprised] WHOA!
Jake:  [The gems shake inside his bag] Ooooooohhhhhhh!
Billy:  Exhibio Carnotum! [Show the Chart!]
Finn:  Whoa!
Jake:  Cool!
Finn:  What is this this stuff?
Billy:  Hold on!
Booko:  [speaking very rapidly] Hello, my name is Booko! What you see here is a map of the multiverse! It shows all the known dimensions and the links between each of them. This is the dimension that contains the universe in which we currently reside.
Jake:  Enhance!
Jake:  Whoa... Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm...MAKE IT STOP!
Booko: [Clears throat; again, spoken very rapidly] Anyways, At the center of the multiverse is a dimension called the Time Room, believed to be the quasi-corporeal dwelling place of the almighty Prismo. The Time Room is the single dimension that exists outside of time. The Time Room produces time waves that are experienced by other dimensions. Some dimensions have permanent links that allow travel to and from. Others become linked temporarily by naturally forming Worm Holes. And others can become linked artificially by magical portals, torn open by items of great power. Once the last gem is inserted into the Enchiridion it will have the power to create a portal to any dimension in the multiverse. An activated portal creates a time dilation in which either end of the portal experiences a temporal synchronization allowing for the safe passage of particles [Deep breath] through a non-local region of space-time.
Billy:  I'm going to push the Lich in there [pointing to the projection of the portal.]
Finn:  Whoa... Cool!
Jake:  Let's go get that gem!
Finn:  Yeah!
Little Candy Person:  Hi!
Princess Bubblegum:  AHHHHH!!!! WHO'S THERE?!
Finn: [Coughs, approaches PB on his knees and clings to PB, acting desperate] Princess! Princess! I need the gem from your crown!
Princess Bubblegum:  WHAT THE JUNK?!? NO!
Princess Bubblegum:  What the? UGH!!! GET OFF!!!! [Finn uses even more force to try and take the gem] GET OFF OF ME! [Accidentally cuts Finn with the scissors in her hands; Finn is repulsed, but PB's crown is thrown off her head]
Finn:  [In pain] OOOOWWWW! [Falls on his behind; he feels the cut on his cheek and hisses at PB]
Princess Bubblegum: [Stares at the scissors, realizing what she did] That was an accident.
Princess Bubblegum: [Pleading] FINN!!! STOP!!!! [frustrated, she lets out a groan and chases after Finn]
Billy: [gesturing for Finn and Jake to reach him] HURRY!!!
Princess Bubblegum:  FINN! STOP!!! That's not Billy! IT'S THE LICH!!!
Finn:  HUH?
Gumball Guardian:  LICH ALERT! LICH ALERT!
Finn: [In distress] BILLY!!!!!! [Rushes towards Billy]
Finn:  Ba.... Billy?
The Lich:  The book, Finn! Give me the book! [reaches his arm out to receive The Enchiridion]
The Lich:  Quickly, child! We're running out of time!
Finn:  [slowly walking backwards as the Lich crawls towards him] Lich! You... You messed Billy up! You just wanna mess me all up! Mess everyone up! You tricked me!
The Lich:  No child! It's all true! The book has great power! I can make you live... Forever! Anything you want! Just give me that BOOK! [Dives towards Finn, who leaps over him] Grrrrrr....
Finn:  Oh no no no no no no no NO MORE TRICKS! YOU'LL NEVER GET THIS BOOK! [Smashes the Enchiridion over his knees]
The Lich:  NOOOOO!!! [slight echo]
Finn:  Uhhhhh....
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh NO!!! Finn! WHAT DID YOU DO?!
Finn:  [Coming to again] Huh.... What?
The Lich:  Thanks Finn! I couldn't have done it without you!
Princess Bubblegum:  JAKE, STOP HIM! DON'T LET HIM THROUGH THAT PORTAL!
The Lich:  NGH! GET OFF! [Kicks Jake aside] Eh... [walks through the portal]
Princess Bubblegum:  [Walks towards Jake] HANG ON, JAKE!!!
Finn:  HOLD ON JAKE!!! [Grabs Jake from behind] YAH!!!
Finn's mom:  Finn! [Finn looks towards the window, where his mother is calling him] Finn! Will you come here please? Hurry! It's VERY Important!
Finn:  Coming Mom! [Talking to Jake] Man, she seems steamed! Guess I done something up yet again... Come on Jake.[They walk back to the house from the stump they were sitting at, dash to get in the house, and then the episode ends]
