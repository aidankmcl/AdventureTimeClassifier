Jake:  [pointing] Dude! Shooting star! Make a wish!
Finn:  [chuckles] That's not a shooting star. [Finn grabs the orb from the air.] It's just a firefly.
Finn:  What are you gonna wish for dude?
Jake:  Oh, you know. That something special only two bros can share.
Finn:  [excited] I think I'm wishing for the same thing!
Jake:  You mean the...
Finn and Jake:  Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant!
Jake:  Oh, man I wanna ride it so bad!
Finn:  How do you even control those things?
Jake:  You can't control it dude. You have to let it give you control.
Finn:  Oh wow!
Jake:  Start wishin'!
Finn:  What the...
Hot Dog Princess:  [gasps] That's a distress flare from my other Hot Dog Knights. I sent them to rescue my other other Hot Dog Knights who got trapped in a labyrinth! Their message says... "Baby... us... trouble... time...." They must be in grave danger! [whispering] Hot Dog Knights are slow. 
Finn:  Don't worry, princess. Jake and I are on it.
Finn:  Whoa! Fudge, man! This place is yoga balls huge! 
Jake:  [chuckles] Yoga balls aren't that really huge, dude.
Finn:  Hey, man, I can't analyze everything that comes out of my mouth.
Jake:  [whispering] Should we like, try to cheat and stretch over the walls?
Finn:  Nah, man. Look.
Jake:  Okay, well... then... I'll just hook my legs around this stump and stretch us through so we don't get lost. Like this, see? [Jake wraps his hind legs around the stump and starts walking with his front legs.]
Finn:  [laughing] You're a cool guy, Jake. 
Jake:  Thank you.
Finn:  Man, there're so many passage ways and stuff. It'll take us forever to find those Hot Dog Kni-iights?
Hot Dog Knight #1:  [pleading] Don't eat me, man!
Jake:  Nah, we're here to save you, guy!
Hot Dog Knight #2:  [sighing] Oh, thank the stars. We were lost!
Hot Dog Knight #3:  How didn't you guys get lost?
Finn:  We're just gonna follow Jake's body back.
Hot Dog Knight #1:  At the centre of the maze, there's a magic creature that grants wishes.
Finn:  Wishes? [To Jake] Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Finn and Jake:  Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant!
Jake:  This is our chance!
Hot Dog Knights: Hot dog!
Jake:  [slides under the Hot Dog Knights and picks them up.] Hold on boys, we're gonna get us some wishes!
Jake:  Choo-choo. [Jake stretches around a bend while Finn looks on.]
Finn:  [looking at Jakes stretched figure worriedly.] Dang, Jake. Your body's getting thin!
Jake:  Yeah, I got a nice bod!
Finn:  Yeah, but now... [hesitating] not so nice.
Jake:  Okay, well you can take your weird body issues and tuck them somewhere private. Where I can take my healthy body issues... and [Jake gasps as a mud golem appears before them.] FIGHT A GOLEM!
Golem:  TRESPASSERS! 
Finn:  Wrap 'im up, Jake!
Jake:  I'm on it! [Jake entangles the golem's body, but begins to struggle.]
Jake:  [straining] Stop flexing. I can't... stretch.... any more.
Hot Dog Knight #2:  [encouraging] You can do it, Jake! Stretch stretch stretch! Wrap him up more!
Jake:  Come on baby.
Jake:  [exhausted] Golem... taken care of... dudes.
Hot Dog Knight #1:  Jake, you're amazing.
Finn:  Jake, you need to take it easy on the stretching, man.
Hot Dog Knight #2:  Wha... n-no Jake, you can keep going, man. Right guys? Come on, Jake, you can go!
Hot Dog Knights:  Jake! Jake! Jake!
Jake:  [still exhausted] Hehe. [sighs] Alright. Come on, Finn. The stretching train is leaving the station. Choo-choo.
Jake:  Just gotta keep stretchin'.
Finn:  Uh, yeah. [Finn hears something.] Wait! Stop, Jake. Ya hear that?
Jake:  No.
Finn:  This place is weirding me out. Keep your eyes open for traps and junk.
Jake:  Whoa! Check that out!
Finn:  Oh, snap! That's you dude.
Jake:  Hmm.
Finn:  [Finn pokes Jake's body.] Boop.
Jake:  Hey, man. Watch it. I think that's my nerp, but like super stretched out.
Finn:  [still poking Jake's 'nerp'.] Boop boop. Boop boop boop boop boop.
Jake:  [laughing] Stop man!
Jake:  [shocked] NERP!
Finn:  Oh my Grob! [while being stung]
Hot Dog Knight #1:  [while being stung] It's okay, hot dogs are immune to poison.
Finn:  Sick!
Jake:  I got it! [Jake enlarges his hands, catching the falling scorpions and pushing them into the holes, which he blocks with a portion of his body. From within the whole the scorpions repeatedly sting Jake.]
Jake:  Owowowowowowowowow.
Hot Dog Knights:  Jake! Jake! Jake!
Jake:  [coughing] I'm good, man. It's the small scorpions you gotta worry about. Or is that just with snakes? [rumbling] Oop, nope, wait, poison's kickin' in. [groans in pain]
Hot Dog Knights:  No Jake no!
Hot Dog Knight #4:  Work through the pain! Let's get wishes!
Hot Dog Knights:  Wishes!
Jake:  [groaning] Alright, you guys, hop on! [Jakes grabs the knights and puts them on his head.] Let's do it.
Finn:  [worried] I don't think this is a good idea, man.
Jake:  [reassuring] I'm fine, brother. We'll have that war elephant in no time!
Finn:  Ah, uh, okay...
Finn:  [awed] Woah! [The adventurers look up at a giant statue holding a sliding puzzle. Finn looks at the puzzle.] Hmm, looks like the final puzzle. You think you can stretch up there, buddy.
Jake:  [raspy whisper] Yes.
Finn:  [shocked] Whoa! Jake, you okay?!
Jake:  Huh, yeah, I just... can't close my eyes... lids... too tight.
Finn:  [demanding] Okay, dude this is too far! No more maze, we're going home.
Jake:  Yeah... I'm feeling a little thin.
Hot Dog Knights:   No! Don't stop! Keep stretching!
Hot Dog Knight #2:  You stretch good!
Hot Dog Knights:  Jake! Jake! Jake! Woohoo!
Jake:  Ah, alright.
Finn:  Jake, no! You're gonna get hurt.
Jake:  [stretching towards the puzzle] I'm goin' for it!
Finn:  Jake, no!
Jake:  [grunts] Done!
Finn:  That must be the wishes!
Hot Dog Knight #2:  [mesmerized] Kitty!
Finn:  You did it, man. No we can go wish for a...
Finn and Jake:  [while fist bumping] Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant.
Jake:  [while getting thinner] Gotta move carefully. My internal organs are super stretched, I'm paper thin!
Hot Dog Knight #2:  [sighing] I love kitties!
Hot Dog Knight #2:  I am sorry!
Jake:  Ow! Ooh!
Finn:  [screaming in shock] JAKE! [He raises Jake's head.]
Jake:  My insides are all mashes up!
Finn:  I knew we should have turned back!
Jake:  You were right. I pushed myself too far. I'll never fall victim to peer pressure again!
Hot Dog Knight #4:  No! Jake! Jake! Jake!
Jake:  Actually, I'll do anything you guys want if you say my name three times. [Jake lies back in agony.]
Finn:  Just hang tight, buddy. I'll use my wish to save you.
Aquandrius:  Congratulations, warriors. [Aquandrius, a muddy serpent, appears at the podium.] Step forward, and take your wishes.
Hot Dog Knight #1:  [excited] Ah! I'm gonna wish for a hat! Woohoo.
Aquandrius:  Who's next?
Hot Dog Knight #3:  Nuh-uh, that floor got traps! Jake should stretch us across
Hot Dog Knight #4:  Jake! Jake! Jake!
Jake:  Here we go! [coughs] Ooh.
Finn:  [adamant] No! Jake is all jacked up.
Hot Dog Knight #3:  Then how else can we get wishes?!
Finn:  Jake! Get up and carry us across!
Jake:  But I'm too weak!
Jake:  Yeaargh! That's it, I'm dead. [He drops Finn and collapses, he is now thinner than Finn's arm.]
Finn:  Jake! Stay with me, man!
Jake:  Nah.
Finn:  But we did it, okay! I can wish you out of here, man!
Aquandrius:  Oh yes, now you may each receive your wishes. For real! [The orb glows, sending out four smaller orbs towards the adventurers.] But be warned. There are no do overs!
Finn:  Okay, [To Hot Dog Knights] So you guys should wish to get your buddies back, right?
Hot Dog Knight #4:  I wish for a box! [His orb disappears and a cardboard box appears next to him.] Sweet!
Hot Dog Knight #3:  And I wish to blow up! I mean like get big! [He explodes, and his orb disappears.]
Finn:  Wow, you guys are really stupid.
Hot Dog Knight #4:  [settling into his new box] What do you mean?
Aquandrius:  [to Jake] Dog, you're next! What do you wish?
Jake:  Huh?
Finn:  Jake! Wish for the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant! Then I'll wish to save you!
Jake:  Right. So hard to think on an empty stomach. I wish I wasn't so hungry. [Jake's orb disappears and a sandwich appears on top of him. He takes a bite.]
Finn:  You wasted your wish, man!
Jake:  I know. You should wish for the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant. It's what we wanted.
Finn:  That's crazy, man! I gotta save your life.
Jake:  Do it... for... me!
Finn:  I... wish... for... the Ancient PSYCHIC TANDEM WAR ELEPHANT!
Jake:  Yes!
Aquandrius:  Your wish is granted.
Jake:  It has to give you control! Remember!
Finn:  I'm on it. [He leaps onto the elephant's leg and climbs up to its eye.] Rah! [speaking telepathically] Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant. HEAR ME!
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant:  [telepathically] Finn the Human! Are you worthy to command me? 
Finn:  [telepathically] You know I am, because you're psychic! [speaking] Now wish for my friends to be healed!
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant:  [speaking] I wish... for what Finn... desires.
Jake:  Yeah, boyyy!
Aquandrius:  No! You weren't supposed to have your wishes come true! [angrily] You were supposed to die!
Finn:  Now, bust us outta here!
Aquandrius:  No! 
Finn:  Yeah, boyyy!
