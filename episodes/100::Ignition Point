Jake:  Ready?
Flame Princess:  Yes
Jake:  [Sounds of concentration] [Then farts] [Seals Squeez-E-Mart bag like a balloon.]
Flame Princess:  [Shoots the balloon with her fire] [Balloon explodes]
Finn:  That was awesome! Alright, alright, my turn. [Lies on Jake's back] [Sounds of concentration] [Then burps] [Seals Squeez-E-Mart bag like a balloon.]
Flame Princess:  [Focuses on balloon and shoots the balloon] [Balloon explodes]
Finn:  [Laughter]
Flame Princess:  [Laughter] You guys are full of magic air.
Jake:  [Gasps] [Farts]
Finn:  [Disgusted] Gross! [Rolls with Jake] [Then slaps Jake] No! [Turns to Flame Princess] Princess? You, okay?
Flame Princess:  [Looks downed] Yeah... It's just the air smells bad from your magic tricks, and now I feel sad. [Looks at Finn and Jake] I left all my scented candles at the castle. They'd really cut through the magic stink.
Jake:  Just go back to the Fire Kingdom and get 'em. Problem solved.
Flame Princess:  [Sighs] [Then stands up] Then I'll have to see my dad. I'm still mad at him for imprisoning me in that lantern. So UNFAIR! [Flame Princess transforms again to her enraged form.] [Screams with anger]
Finn & Jake:  [Frightened]
Finn:  Uh, we can go get 'em.
Flame Princess:  [Returns to her normal form.] [Pleasant voice] Really? That would be really nice. [Warns] But don't let my Pops see you. I don't want "His Majesty" thinking I need anything from him.
Flambo:  [Farts]
Finn, Flame Princess, & Jake:  [Surprised]
Jake:  That ain't me.
Finn, Flame Princess, & Jake:  [Looks at the rock]
Finn & Jake:  Whoa!
Flambo:  [inside the rock] [Farts more]
Finn & Jake:  [Approaches the rock]
Finn:  [Opens the rock]
Flambo:  Oh! [Farts again]
Finn:  [Relieved]
Jake:  Flambo! [Whispers to Finn] For a second, I thought the princess was farting.
Finn:  Flambo, we need you to cast Flame Shield on us.
Flambo:  [Agrees to Finn] Alright! [Rubs both of his hands] [Flambo casting the Flame Shield; chants and also creates a series of runic symbols. He grows two big fists and hits Finn and Jake on the forehead.]
Jake:  [Stretches his left arm to hold onto something with Finn holding onto his back, sneaking pass the Flame Guards.]
Finn & Jake:  [Tip toe walking towards near the scented candles.]
Finn:  These candles, must be "They."
Jake:  [Sniffing the candles] [Whispers] They smell like an old lady's bathroom.
Finn:  [Whispers with anger] Hey! Don't disrespect my lady!
Jake:  [Whispers in reply] I said that as a compliment. Like, it reminds me of grandma. I love my grandma.
Finn:  [Takes the candles and puts them into his backpack.]
Furnius:  No one comes-sss here. Not since Flame Princess [Finn jumps and lies close to the bottom of the door.] leaved [for left] the castle. Now guesssss what we're gonna kill Flame King with?
Finn:  [Gasps] [Then whispers] A conspirator with a hiss voice!
Torcho:  How about, water?
Furnius:  Even worsssse, we'll use icccce.
Finn:  [Whispers] And a conspirator with an untied shoe.
Torcho:  Ice? Why ice?
Furnius:  Cuz it'sss more painful, You sssimpleton! Cold as iccce fallzz. A perfect death for the Flame King.
Furnius & Torcho:  [Evil laughter]
Finn:  [Gasps, turns around, and Jake is thrown away.]
Jake:  Whoa!
Finn:  Did you hear that?
Jake:  [Sniffs]
Finn:  Jake, come on! We gotta stop those guys from killing Flame Princess's dad!
Jake:  [Drops the candle] Right, right.

Finn:  We must follow the voice
Jake:  [Opens the air vent] [Uses his stretchy powers to get there and pulls Finn up.] [Then closes the air vent]
Unknown:  To die, to sleep; To sleep: perchance to dream...
Finn:  [Whispers] Which way is the hiss voice coming from?
Unknown:  ...there's the rub; For in that sleep of death what...
Jake:  [Whispers] This way!
Unknown:  ...dreams may come.
Jake:  [Drags self]
Finn:  [Whispers] Which way?

Jake:  [Whispers] To the left

Jake:  [Whispers] I don't think it's them.
Fire Denizens 2:  Double you! Double you!
Jake:  [Falls] Whooaaa.
Finn:  [Whispers for checking] Jake!
Jake:  [Whispers in response] I'm okay. I think I hear that hissing voice down this way!
Finn:  [Falls down toward Jake] Whooooo! [Falls flat on his face.] [Questions with disappointment] Why didn't you catch me?
Jake:  Whoops. Tell me next time, I can't think in the future.

Red snake:  [Hisses again]
Jalapeno pepper:  .... snake on your shoulder.
Finn:  What?

Theater troupe:  [Chattering]
Theater troupe leader:  Five minutes are closing everyone, five minutes.
Finn & Jake:  [Takes two members of the theater troupe to a room.]
Finn:  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Jake:  [Picks up a table with food on it]
Finn & Jake:  [Runs with disguises on]
Jalapeno pepper:  [Panting] [Then heads to a room] Oh. Psh, actors.
Finn:  [Lays a hand on a theater troupe member] What's going with the costumes?
Theater troupe member:  [High voice] This is a theater troupe. We're getting rrready to perform for the king. Everyone in the kingdom shall be in attendance. [Lowered voice] Of course, you know all this being fellow actors from the exact same troupe. [Turns around and picks clothes]
Jake:  [Makes a distance with Finn] I have an idea. We'll go on stage, act like two conspirators, you will have one shoe untied, I'll talk with a hiss voice, we'll talk about how we want to kill the king, as we do these, we'll study the faces of the audience, a move of guilty reactions.
Finn:  [Likes it] That's brilliant!
Jake:  Thanks! It's an original idea, by me.
Audience:  [Cheering]
Finn:  [Clears throat] Hey conspirator!
Jake:  Hey co-conspirator!
Finn:  Let's talk about how we're gonna kill the king.
Jake:  Shhhhhh sssssomebody might here our evil plot.
Flame King:  [Not liking it] Man, I am so lost.
Jake:  Psst, the audience.
Suspect:  [Moaning] [Then sneezes]
Jake:  You think that's one of them.
Finn:  Maybe, let's keep goin'. So, what are you packin'?
Jake:  Water, man. Enough of it to put out the King's fire.
Suspect:  [Still moaning] [Then eats a hot dog] [Looking around with suspicion]
Finn:  I thinks he's starting to crack. Water? You know what is more painful, if we pour ice in his ear. That's how we'll kill the Flame King.
Flame King:  [Bored] Psh, kill the Flame King? [Thinks about it] [Then behind him, an arm appeared, holding ice and fails to pour on him.] [Angry reaction] This is treason disguised as a play! [Orders] Guards, seized them!
Flame Guards:  [Approaching Finn and Jake]
Finn:  What!? No!
Flame Guards:  [Pinning Finn and Jake to the ground]
Finn & Jake:  [Grunts]
Finn:  Please, we were trying to warn you about the assassins!

Furnius:  You cannot quench the flamessss of revenge!
Torcho:  You snucked on our father to become king!
Flame King:  Oh, yeah! Hehe. [Orders] Take them to the punishment room!
Flame Guards:  [Takes Furnius and Torcho to the punishment room.]
Furnius:  I'll dessstroy all of you, with ice!
Torcho:  Release me!
Finn:  Wait! So, you? You extinguished their dad?
Flame King:  [Yes tone]
Finn:  And everyone is evil here?
Flame King:  [Performs a stunt towards the stage]
Flame King:  [Yes tone] All evil.
Finn:  Then, is Flame Princess: evil or maybe chaotic neutral?
Flame King:  She's evil.
Finn:  Okay, so your daughter's evil. We've established that, but do you think if a good guy really liked her, could he, change her to good?
Flame King:  Hmmmmm, well, there'd be penalties to her experience, if she acted out of alignment. But, yes, someone could change her.
Finn:  [Smiles happily]
Finn & Jake:  [Leaves the stage]
Flame King:  [Thinks about his daughter] Change her to good? [Worried]
Finn:  Aww...
Flame Princess:  [Breathing]
Jake:  [Picks the scented candles and lights them with Flame Princess's hair] [Then puts them on her bedside table]
Flame King:  [Looks around] Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil.... EVIL!!!
Flame Princess:  [Wakes up] Aah!

Flame Princess:  [Turns around right after what she saw]
