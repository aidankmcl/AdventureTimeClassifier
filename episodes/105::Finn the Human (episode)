Finn:  [gasps] He's heading for that cube. Come on, Jake.
Jake:  Oh, yeah.
Finn:  Whaaaat?!?! He's gone!
Jake:  What?! What happened?!
Prismo:  Hey, hey! Did you guys see that? You know that was a ghost wearing a dead guy? That might be the nastiest thing I've ever seen. Na-na-na-na-nasty! Nasty jazz! Nast-- [Almost like beat boxing]
Jake:  Hey, hey! Easy, buddy! That's our friend Billy! He got possessed by the Lich! [Finn looks very sad and Jake puts an arm around him]
Prismo:  Oh! Sorry, sorry! I didn't mean nothin' by it! I mean, I have a lot of nasty friends. My uncle is nasty. I'm basically honorary nasty.
Finn:  [Jake stretches them down to the floor] Do you know where he went? We have to find our friend.
Prismo:  Who knows?
Finn:  [Depressed] Uh. Oh.
Prismo:  Actually, it depends on the wish I granted him.
Finn:  "Wish"? [Hastily]
Prismo:  Yeah, he wished for the extinction of all life and I did it. I guess it changed his timeline or something?
Finn:  WHAT?!?! OH GLOB!
Jake:  Whoa, wait a minute. How can that be if I'm still here kickin' it with my main man, Finn?
Prismo:  Oh, that's because you're safe in my time room until you make your wish.
Finn & Jake:  [They pause to think] Ohhhh.
Jake:  I wish that life wasn't anymore extinc
Finn:  [Finn pushes Jakes arm down] Whoa! Wait, Jake. Don't mess this up. Think about it: if we wish everything back to normal, the Lich could just jazz it up again.
Jake:  Oh yeah. Jazz.
Finn:  Hmmmm. [Thinking]
Jake:  Hmmmm.
Finn:  I got it! I wish... the Lich... never... even ever existed!
Farmworld Finn:  Mom? Mom, what's wrong?
Finn's mom:  [Holding Finn's Baby Brother and looking concerned] Finn, I need you to do something for me. It's very important. [Jake barks] I need you to take the mule into town and sell him for as much as you can.
Farmworld Finn:  What! Sell Bartram? [Bartram sits up in the bed in the corner] But, I love Bartram. What the heck, Mom!
Finn's Mother:  Shhh! Finn please, just do as I say. [She looks out the window concerned]
Trami:  [Muffled by the distance] Got it?
Farmworld Finn:  [Looking out the window, Finn sees a group of stylish thugs harassing his dad] Dad?
Trami:  I push you, you fall down. [Trami and another gang member table top him]
Farmworld Finn:  The Destiny Gang?
Finn's Mother:  Everything will be fine, Finn, I promise. Now just do as I say. [Walks away]
Farmworld Finn:  [Finn is now outside near the fields sitting on a tree root] [sigh] I'm sorry, Bartram. I guess Dad must be in real trouble to be doin' this. But, I bet there's a lot o' fine folk lookin' to buy a good mule. Why, I bet I could even come visit sometimes. Won't that be swell, Bartram? [Looks around and sees that the mule is gone] Bartram? Dang it Bartram! Bar Bar! [Finn walks through some bushes to find Batram in a dead tree] What the- Bar Bar, how'd ya get up there? [sigh] Whoa! [Finn falls through some bushes and into an underground cave. Jake follows. There is a frozen missile with a dead man under it] Jake, look! Golden crown! Unbelievable! We can sell it and keep Bartram! Bong, bong. [Finn reaches for the crown]
Marceline:  [She comes out from behind the missile and cocks her gun] Hold it right there!
Farmworld Finn:  Who are you?!
Marceline:  I'm a thousand years old and this is my crown!
Farmworld Finn:  Okay, okay! But, um, maybe I could just borrow it for a little while. [Finn reaches for the crown again]
Marceline:  Noooo! No! Noo! This crown is magic. Bad, terrible magic. Too dangerous for mortal fingies like yours! [Marceline has a flashback of Simon walking onto a hill to watch a squad of bombers.] One thousand years ago, my beloved friend Simon Petrikov gave his life to save this foolish, unworthy planet from annihilation. [A scene shows a mushroom cloud amidst a decimated city and a gang of demons surrounding the Lich walking away from it] A frightful bomb was poised to bathe the land in mutagenic horror, [Simon is show directly below the bomb using his not yet complete powers to freeze the bomb in midair] but using his mastery of ice and snow, Simon froze the bomb in mid-flight only inches from the ground, where it remains to this very day. [We see Marceline in the cave again] Today, ever ripe and ready to blow. [We see Simon being crushed by the bomb] But he alone was not saved. Trapped under the giant weight of the enormous bomb, poor Simon perished!
Simon:  [In the flash back] Little help?
Marceline:  [Simon is seen dead and the crown is firing laser-like beams of energy] And the horrible crown, grieving its lost master, loosed a spasm of magic so wild and crazy the entire earth was buried in ice for four hundred boring years. [First we see a city being frozen almost instantaneously and then we see the earth covered in ice. The flashback ends.]
Farmworld Finn:  Uhh, none o' that is true, 'cause magic is fake. Daddy says the false prophets of old used cheap parlor tricks to control the people. [Farmworld Jake is growling] And to get babes. Like 10 or 12 hot babes each.
Marceline:  No! Magic is real!
Farmworld Finn:  Lady! You been down here too long! Why don't you, just let me- [Finn goes for the crown again]
Marceline:  Step off! Or I will use this!
Farmworld Finn:  Lady! Quit it with that thing! [Finn reels back and Jake begins barking again]
Marceline:  I'm sorry. You must DIEEEE! [A laser beam is fired from the gun]
Farmworld Finn:  WAAAAAAAAAAaaaaah... ooo... uuum... [The laser is ineffective and passes right through him]
Marceline:  Oh, man! This thing! Dang it! [She hits it]
Farmworld Finn:  Go, Jake! [Jake jumps at her as a distraction while Finn grabs the crown]
Marceline:  Aaah! Go back to the underworld, ya beast. [She throws the gun weakly towards Jake]
Farmworld Finn:  Sorry, gotta save my dad! [They exit the cave]
Marceline:  Destroy the world more like it! [huff] Dummy. I give up.
Simon:  The crown. Go get it.
Marceline:  I know you're not really talking to me. I'm not crazy!
Simon:  Get the crown! Go get it!
Marceline:  [huff]
Simon:  Get the crown, Marceline! Go get it!
Marceline:  I can't. My knees!
Simon:  Oh, that's really disappointing I must say. I'm justuh, whatever, you're really letting me down right now.
Marceline:  Okay, alright. [farts]
Farmworld Finn:  [Finn is auctioning off the crown at the Junktown market] Cool crown! Who wants a cool crown? I found it on a dead magician dude!
Guy #1:  I'll take it!
Farmworld Finn:  Awesome! How much cash ya got?
Guy #1:  Ohhh, I'm poor. Uh, but what about I trade you for a personal concert at your house? I'll come over later and sing ya like, four songs. I mostly do covers, but I have originals too. Do you own any spoons?
Farmworld Finn:  No.
Tromo:  Let me see that! [He takes the crown]
Farmworld Finn:  Hey!
Tromo:  Heh!
Farmworld Finn:  [gasp] [Finn has a flashback of the D gang harassing his dad] Wait, Destiny Gang. I gotta sell that to pay you guys!
Tromo:  Trami, what you think? Is it my style?
Trami:  Big Destiny will know. Yo, boss! [Trami throws the crown to Big D who is looking off the cliff]
Big Destiny:  Snap! Huh? What is this? [He turns around] Are you tellin' me what to wear, Trami?
Trami:  No, boss, you look good! [He is sweating]
Big Destiny:  You think I should reinvent my style and put a stupid thing on my head?!
Trami:  No, man! You tell us what to wear!
Big Destiny:  Otherwise you would dress like an idiot! Bam! Crown shorts! [Big D puts the tip of the crown in his extremely short shorts]
Trami & Tromo:  Amazing! [Everyone begins clapping.]
Big Destiny:  Yeah-ha-ha!
Tromo:  Clap harder, trash bag! [He pushes down an old man who begins silently crying and clapping faster]
Farmworld Finn:  Okay, you guys. Gimme my money and leave my parents alone.
Tromo:  Property of old dead person go to Big Destiny. [Tromo grabs an apple from a stand and takes a bite] One-arm needs to learn the rules, unless you want your butt handed to you.
Farmworld Finn:  I guess it wasn't really mine.
Marceline:  [Tromo drops his apple] It's mine! I'm a demon... half-demon.
Big Destiny:  Tromo! Jack up crazy lady! Trami! Take mule back to crib for din-din.
Farmworld Finn:  Whaat! [Trami hits Finn in the face with his hammer knocking him off Bartram. He lifts up Batram and takes him] Bar Bar!
Trami:  Tough luck, One-arm! [He and Big D jump onto a ski-lift-like pully system up to their mansion]
Big Destiny:  See you soon, bad-style Junktown! [Big D laughs evilly]
Farmworld Finn:  Bar Bar. [Finn is about to cry]
Tromo:  End of the road, bat lady! [He kicks over Marceline]
Marceline:  Oh, my bones!
Tromo:  Haha! Ah! [Finn sticks his flute up Tromo's nose and plays, inflating Tromo's eye] My eye! I will junk your face! What the! [Choose Bruce hits him in the head with a head of lettuce]
Choose Bruce:  Destiny gang, get outta town! We're sick of bein' bullied around! [Everyone cheers]
Tromo:  You make biiig mistake! Especially you, One-arm! [He backs up to the lift and leaves]
Farmworld Finn:  My name is Finn Mertens! And tell big D I'm comin' for my stuff!
Tromo:  Ohhh, you come n' try!
Farmworld Finn:  Are you okay, lady?
Marceline:  You must promise topromise to return the crown to its hide-hole.
Farmworld Finn:  I promise.
Choose Bruce:  You'll need this Finn if you want to win. [He shows Finn a sword attachment for his robotic arm]
Farmworld Finn:  Choose Bruce, what is it?
Choose Bruce:  It's a weapon for your arm. With this you will defend from harm. [He replaces his grabber arm with the sword arm]
Farmworld Finn:  Feels natural. Like peeing outside. Sort of.
Choose Bruce:  Best not to take the lift my friend, else the D gang'll see ya comin' in!
Farmworld Finn:  No. I want them to see me. I'm-a go up there AND SHOW THEM MY FACE! [Finn rides up the lift and kicks down the door and runs in] Yaaaaaaaaaa-huh? Hello? [He doesn't see anyone, but hears Bartram bray] Bar Bar? I'm comin'! Bar bar! [He runs into the room, but Big D trips him on the way in] I want my stuff, ya big dump! [He charges Big D, but he is easily beaten]
Big Destiny:  You want Big D's crown, huh?
Farmworld Finn:  Yeah, and Bar Bar.
Big Destiny:  Here ya go then. [Hands him the crown]
Farmworld Finn:  Wha?
Big Destiny:  That is your final possession, the last thing you will ever own.
Farmworld Finn:  What do you...mean? [He walks over to the window with Big D]
Big Destiny:  Look down there, stupid.
Farmworld Finn:  [gasp] [The town is on fire]
Big Destiny:  Town is on fire! See? I made it on fire! Fix up Junktown! Look at old man cry! [laughs] That's what happens when you mess with Big D! You get crushed! Your family get crushed! Booya! [We see the Destiny gang throwing torches everywhere and Choose Bruce crying]
Farmworld Finn:  Suck my shirt! [Finn, throwing off his sword, slides down the lift with Bartram and rides up to Choose Bruce] Choose Bruce!
Choose Bruce:  All my stuff is gone! Now they're goin' after your home! [He is crying still]
Farmworld Finn:  Bar Bar, come on!
Choose Bruce:  Hurry, Finn! You can win! [Still crying]
Marceline:  Finn! Return thewhoa! [While continuing to ride Bartram, he lifts her on]
Farmworld Finn:  I will, but we gotta stop the Destiny gang first. Come on Jake! Good boy! [Jake is trialing them]
Destiny Gang:  Destiny! Destiny! Destiny! [Finn's house is on fire and the D gang are chanting]
Farmworld Finn:  Noooo!
Big Destiny:  Yeah! How did I even get here, son?!
Finn's Mother:  Nooo! [Finn's family are up stairs, trapped in the fire]
Finn's Father:  Fiiinn!
Farmworld Finn:  Mom! Dad! [He reaches into his pack and pulls out the crown] You said this thing is magic?
Marceline:  Yes. Powerful and dangerous.
Farmworld Finn:  But you lost your mind in a cave.
Marceline:  Whatever. You just gotta believe me, okay? For serious, ya donk.
Big Destiny:  I am Big D! Wooooo!
Farmworld Finn:  I believe you.
Marceline:  You do? [He puts on the crown and begins yelling in shock] Wait! Noooooo! Dang it!
Farmworld Finn:  Aaaaaah!!
