Lemongrab: Commence dinner.
Lemongrab: Dinner is concluded.
Everyone else: [in unison] Concluded. [clap twice]
Lemongrab: Up.
Lemon Person: Ooh!
Lemongrab: Mm. Lights out!
Lemongrab: Huh?!
Lemongrab: Bye.
Finn: Better get up here, Jake. It's about to happen.
Jake: Coming! Just gotta get this cocoa pipin'.
Finn: Your loss, man. The Dap of the Heavens only happens every 20 years. [looks through telescope] Oh, man. It's going down.
Jake: Okay. Let's watch some stars.
Finn: Hmm. You missed it. It was honestly a little disappointing
Jake: Oh. Okay. Hey, man, I think I hear something weird over there with my little doggy ears.
Flame Princess: Phew! You are killing, Cinnamon Bun! This routine is locked up!
Cinnamon Bun: Oh! Thank you, Princess. You are also killing.
Finn: You mean Flame Princess?
Jake: Naw, man. What I heard didn't sound like her. Give me a peek on there. This is pretty much just a tube. [looks through his flesh-scope and takes Finn's telescope] Huh. It's Lemongrab.
Finn: Uh, Lemongrab?! What's he up to at this time of night?
Jake: Uh... it looks like he's headed for the Mountain of Matthew. I hear beaucoup spookoo legends about that place.
Finn: Beaucoup spookoo, you say? We should follow him.
Jake: Huh? How come you care where Lemongrab goes?
Finn: He could, you know, he could be messing with crazy mystic power at that mountain. It's like seeing a baby playing with dynamite. Plus, seeing Flame Princess kind of messed me up. Now I gotta distract myself with work.
Jake: Okay, okay. I feel you. Let's do some things. [shapeshifts into a glider and flies Finn to the mountain]
Finn: There's his Lemon Camel. Lemongrease must be inside already.
