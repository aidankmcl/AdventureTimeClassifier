Finn:  [Laughs] Ahhh... YEAH!!! [Busts through living room door and lands on bridge.]
Jake:  [Entering] Heh heh. [Deep voice] Aw, yeah. [Chuckles]
Finn:  Jake, get ready for a slap in the jowls. [Slaps Jake's nose; Jake does a snorting laugh] Seriously, though... get ready... for a day filled with adventure!
Jake:  Whoa, really?!
Finn:  Yeah, man!! [He slaps Jake's nose again, making him snort and laugh again] I wrote on my arm this to-do list of cool junk. [The clouds begin to get darker and bigger] Number one: back flip off this bridge and do the splits. Number two: track down and slay a goblin horde. Number three...[Glances up at thundering clouds] storm clouds?
Jake:  [Examining] Hmmm... [Knives fall from the clouds and Jake gasps.] Finn... it's a knife storm!! [Finn slaps Jake's nose yet again] It's raining knives, man! Come on! [Exits]
Finn:  I've never seen a knife storm before... It's beautiful.
Jake:  Looks like we're stayin' in today, kid.
Finn:  Well, what're we gonna do?
BMO:  Who wants to play video games??
Finn and Jake:  BMO!!
Jake:  What's on the menu, BMO?
BMO:  I've created a new game called Conversation Parade.
Finn:  Hah! Alright!
Jake:  Start it up, BMO!
BMO:  [singing] What do you think about the stars in the sky?
Finn:  'S okay, I guess.
Jake:  Yeah, they're cool.
BMO:  That is an interesting response! Battery low... Shut doooowwwwn...
Finn:  Booooo.
Jake:  BMO, that was weak.
Finn:  What now?
Jake:  Ooh, ooh! Dude, I know somethin' totally rockin' we can do!
Finn:  Whoa! What?!
Jake:  Let's use our imaginations, man!
Finn:  Barf that! Imagination is for turbo nerds who can't handle how kick-butt reality is! I'm a kick-butt reality master!! I would rather die than be imaginative. I mean that.
Jake:  Eh. Your loss. [Beat] AAAH!!! Lava!! Lava all around us!! [Panicking and jumping around] Lava on the floor!
Finn:  Shut up, man...
Jake:  Seriously, man! There must be an enchantment on the house or somethin'!
Finn:  I'm not playing you child-style games, guy. Watch and learn as I master... reality. [Moves his foot nearer and nearer to the floor]
Jake:  NOOOOO!!
Finn:  [Places foot on floor; it suddenly catches fire] AAAAH!!! [Putting fire out] Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Jake! What the hey-hey?!
Jake:  I was just playin' around with my imagination... [In Jake's view, everything is on fire and lava is on the floor] ...and then everything got intense.
Finn:  It's like... whatever you imagine becomes real... That's bananas!
Jake:  [To himself] Don't imagine blowin' apart my own brain... Don't imagine my eyeballs coming alive and flying around with rocket packs...
Finn:  Dude! Imagine that BMO invented a better video game, and that he has new batteries.
Finn and Jake:  WHOA!
Finn:  But first stop imagining lava!
Jake:  I can't! My imagination's too amazing!
Finn:  Imagine turning your imagination off!
Jake:  I can't, dude... but I think I can imagine an imagination turning-off machine... that is upstairs, surrounded by a crud-load of traps, ghosts, monsters, and poison fountains, and... and... girls. Cute girls, and hamsters.
Finn:  Can't you make it easier to get to that machine?
Jake:  You can't hold this baby back! That's bad parenting, mamma!
Finn:  Then it's up to me to take your imagination downtown! Let's go to the den and suit up!
Jake:  Neat! [Finn and he enter the den] Grab that missile.
Finn:  Okay.
Jake:  And... get that cosmic gauntlet.
Finn:  Nah. There's a better one over by the desk. Ah! UNH! [Finn leaps into an invisible wall.] What did I just hit?!
Jake:  I'm imagining a wall. You can just go around it.
Finn:  Really? That's it? There isn't any invisible, angry troll or anything?
Jake:  Oh, there's one now. [Troll roars] Look out!
Finn:  Aah! I can feel it on my foot! [They stumble over, and Finn's shoe seemingly floats in midair.] I'll kill you, troll! Yah! Yah! Yah, yah, yah, yah!
Jake:  You're kickin' too high! He's shorter than you!
Finn:  Yah, yah! [Finn's blows finally start to land.]
Jake:  Alright! You're gettin' him, man! [Finn continues attacking] Uh-oh. Now you're uppercutting his family. [Finn kicks in the air and a scream is heard.] Heh heh heh heh heh! You just kicked his wife in the face! [Troll wife yells incomprehensibly.] She's comin' back for revenge.
Finn:  Cram this! We gotta book it to your imagination machine! Yah!
Jake:  The knife storm, remember?!?! [Finn frantically pulls himself and Jake up to the attic. They rest and pant heavily.] Oh, boy... Ooh... Finn, I found some candy. [Eats some] It tastes like banana candy, man. [Sips drink] Here, man. Try some.
Finn:  [Standing up] Okay. Try to imagine some kind of steel umbrella over the bridge so... we don't get knifed.
Jake:  Okay! [Does it] It is done.
Finn:  [Walks out cautiously] Haha! Ha! Hey, you did it, man!
Riddle Master:  No, voyagers. To pass this bridge, you must first pass the test of the riddle.
Finn:  [To Jake] An imaginary riddle master?
Finn:  [Sighs] Ask me your riddle, Riddle Master. I accept your test.
Riddle Master:  Then brace yourself, fool, for this riddle comes from a mysterious, far-away land.
Finn:  [Ready] LAY IT ON ME!!
Riddle Master:  Yes, um... The riddle, uh... It... cometh... uh...
Jake:  I can't imagine a riddle.
Finn:  Dude, just make it super easy.
Riddle Master:  THE RIDDLE COMETH! Tell me, voyager. What is simple, and yet also... a riddle?
Finn:  Man, that riddle sucks.
Riddle Master:  THAT IS THE WRONG ANSWER!! The penalty is... DEATH BY SNAKES!!
Finn:  YEAH, RIGHT! I'VE GOT A MISSILE!!
Jake:  You exploded the snakes right at us!!
Finn:  I can feel them all over my face! Imaginary poison coursing through my veins!!
Jake:  I'm sorry, brother! I'm so sorry!
Finn:  Let's just get to your imagination machine and we'll be okay!!
Jake: AAH! A big bowl of baby elephants, chainsaws, and doo-doo's flyin' towards us!! JUMP, DUDE!! [Finn evades the obstacle.] Here come's a soul-eater! Snap its neck! [Finn jumps up and does so. A weapon is heard charging up. Jake gasps.] The Bazooka Goblin has you in its sights!
Finn:  Hey! Don't shoot us with that bazooka!
Finn:  Don't you do it...
Finn:  DON'T DO IT, MAN!!!
Bazooka Goblin:  Hee... heehee... hee... Okay.
Jake:  YEAH!
Finn:  AW, YEAH!
Finn:  Alright, use your powers or something. This poison is about to kill me.
Jake:  Alright. Goin' up. My imagination turning-off machine is left of the bed.
Finn:  Is it clear?
Jake:  Yeah, I mean there's a bunch of cute girls... but they shouldn't bother you.
Finn:  Oh! I found the shut-off lever!
Jake:  Cool, man! [Invisible girl giggles.] Dang, girl. If you weren't a figment of my imagination, I'd want to have your baby. [Another girl giggles.] What're you laughin' at?
Finn:  Alright. I'm gonna turn it off. [Finn is suddenly hit by an invisible force.] UNH!! You said it was clear of danger!!
Jake:  Dude... I can't see anything... I must've imagined... an invisible monster!!
Finn:  What?! Well, how do I kill it?! [Finn gets beaten down.]
Jake:  I'm comin', buddy! Alright, Invisibo. Eat a piece of this! [Punches it] Hurry, Finn! Get to the lever!
Finn:  Okay! I'm doin' iiiit!! [Finn pulls the lever; Jake falls down; Finn's wounds are healed.] Aw, yeah! The imaginary poison is gone, Jake! Jake? [Jake groans.] Hey, come on. Wake up, man.
Jake:  [Completely regular tone] Hello, Finn. I am awake and healthy.
Finn:  Jake... what happened to your bombastic personality?
Jake:  I do not know what you mean. I am perfectly bombastic.
Finn:  Nah, man, nah. Somethin's wrong. Tell me something amazing!
Jake:  But Finn, I cannot tell you something amazing as there is nothing amazing happening around us that I could describe for you.
Finn:  Ah, see, man, you suck now! Crap, it's your imagination. You need that thing. [Sighs]
Finn:  Jake... Stop it, man. You're just playing one continuous note.
Jake:  One note is all that is needed.
Finn:  [Scoffs] I'm gonna turn your imagination back on. [Fidgets around and mumbles to self] Jake! Your imagination on-off switch has vanished!
Jake:  True. Doth thou not remember shutting down mine imagination?
Finn:  I remembereth.
Jake:  I am happy that my imagination is gone. It was purposeless.
Finn:  No! It was the opposite of that stuff. I know this now... [Saddened] ...only too late. Okay, man. I'm gonna try to imagine an imagination back-on switch for you, and so you know, if there's anything dainty inside my imagination, I'm gonna be mad. Imagination... go... [Finn appears in his imagination land.] What the stuff? Well... this isn't so bad. [Imagination back-on machine appears] Nothing lame, at least. Hey! And there's Jake's imagination switch!
Finn:  [Disappointed] Cram. Oh! Maybe I can try imagining something. [He imagines a penguin, and a bowl of spaghetti. The Lyre Player trips over the former and lands in the latter; Finn laughs.] Now for that switch.
Bellamy Bug:  [Entering] Good morrow, sir! My name is Bellamy Bug! Would you care for a crotchet doily my daughter made? She imbued it with her tears. You see, she recently broke up with a gentle dandy.
Finn:  No! How'd you get in my Imagination Land?!
Bellamy Bug:  [Giggles] I don't know, my young fellow! You tell me. Perhaps I represent your secret desire to be civilized!
Finn:  REPRESENT THIS! [Smacks Bellamy] And this. [Imagines two arms protruding out of Bellamy (one cephalopodic and one robotic) which both punch him.]
Bellamy:  Oh! I say! Oh! Ah! Ouch! Ah!
Finn:  Haha... Penguins... Hahahaha! Heh, alright. [Runs over to the machine] I hope this works, Jake! [Pulls lever; Jake's imagination returns.] Haha, yeah! [A fairy comes near the machine giggling.] Hey! Get away from that! Don't push that hyper drive button! [The fairy does.]
Jake:  [Jake's head grows rapidly] Aaaah!! I can imagine EVERYTHING!!!
Finn:  [Frustrated sigh] Take a hike, fairy! Normal style! [Pushes "NORMAL STYLE" button]
Jake:  [Head shrinks] Aw, man... I imagined my mom naked! [Finn appears next to him.] Yugh!
Finn:  You okay?
Jake:  I think so. Lemme check. Mmmm... Yup. She's clothed now. And hey, man! It's clear out now! We can go on an adventure!
Finn:  I don't know, dude. I think we got all the adventure we need right here... [Thinking] with... lava on the floor!
Jake:  Huh?! [Body starts melting] AAH! AAH! MY LEGS ARE MELTING! Just kidding. [Chuckles and reforms his body.]
Finn:  Hahahaha! Good dog. [He pets Jake, and the episode ends.]
