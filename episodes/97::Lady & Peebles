Lady Rainicorn:  heugheugheug andwae. naega wae geuraesseulgga? ("No, no, no. What did I do?") [Princess Bubblegum arrives at the base. Lady Rainicorn cries.]
Lady Rainicorn:  gyaenedeul cajasseoyo? ("Did you find them?")
Princess Bubblegum:  My GPS shows Finn and Jake over there [Points at the window where the Black Ice Cave is seen]. I think that's where the Ice King has them hostage.
Lady Rainicorn:  gyaenedeul anjeonhalggayo? ("Will they be okay?")
Princess Bubblegum:  I'm sure the boys are fine. The Ice King isn't usually a serious threat. [Digs in bag] Besides, this'll be easy with the two of us. [Holds up robotic kettle and cup] We've got science on our side.
Tea robot:  Your tea is ready. [Bubblegum pours.] Pouring. Pouring.

("I told him that his Vietnamese noodles were too tough before he went missing. Why did I say such a thing?! What if something bad happens to him?! The last conversation we had was that his noodles were tough!")
Princess Bubblegum:  It's okay, Lady. Jake knows you love him.
Lady Rainicorn:  mianhaeyo. naega gugsureul neomu manhi meogeossna bwayo. ("Sorry. I guess I've eaten too many noodles.")
Princess Bubblegum:  Don't worry. Just try to relax. [Lady lowers her head calmly.] I'll work on my holo-entry. [Recording herself] It's been three weeks since Finn and Jake disappeared while battling the Ice King. I've activated a secret GPS implanted in Finn's ear. It has lead us to an uncharted black ice cave... but I've spent hours calculating every possible danger and am well-prepared.
Lady Rainicorn:  geunomi kaleul deulgo deombimyeon eoddeoghaeyo?! ("What if he attacks you with a knife?!")
Princess Bubblegum:  [Pulls out her Electrode Gun.] Then I'll pull out my Electrode gun.
Lady Rainicorn:  geunomi gongjunimeul haeciryeogo hamyeonyo?! ("What if he tries to hurt you?!")
Princess Bubblegum:  [Pulls out her Ball Blam Burglerber.] Then... I'll use my Ball Blam Burglerber! Lady, it'll be fine. [Raises fist.]  We've got science!

("You're right. I worry too much sometimes. I always get haunted by this nightmare where zombies attack my house! My uncle, aunt-in-law, and cousins are all present in my house. I even hear the baby crying coming from the upstairs. If I could just protect my dear family. [Princess Bubblegum frowns.] I become too stressful during that dream. I even grind my own teeth! [Grinds teeth, then Princess Bubblegum gasps.] When I wake up in the morning, all my teeth are cracked up! I usually try to forget about it, thinking that it's just a dream or I'm being paranoid, but I was actually attacked by zombies before, twice!")
Princess Bubblegum:  Hmm. I suppose that's true. [Pours beverage out of cup] Let's roll.
Lady Rainicorn:  eueu, jal an boine. ("Ugh, it's hard to see.")
Princess Bubblegum:  Hold up, Lady.
Lady Rainicorn:  mweoyeyo? ("What was that?")
Lady Rainicorn:  eu! aa! geumanhae! dowajweoyo! ("Ah! Stop it! Help!")
Princess Bubblegum:  Don't worry, Lady! [Prepares gun] Ball Blam Burglerber-ber! [She fires a blast; the projectile explodes on the other side of the chamber. An arm pulls down Bubblegum's hood over her eyes.] My field of vision! [A tentacle takes her weapon; she gasps. Another takes her bag.] HEY!!
Princess Bubblegum:  Lady, phase through the wall!
Lady Rainicorn:  gongjunim mugideul! ("Your weapons!")
Princess Bubblegum:  Come on. There's no turning back now.
Ice King [off-screen]:  [Angry] This is total bunk! You copier! You're only in love with her because I'm in love with her!
Lady Rainicorn:  [Gravely] Ice King. (aiseu king.)
Ice King [off-screen]:  I've been playing this game a lot longer than you, pal! I've been workin' my moves, smooth-talkin' 'er, showin' 'er magic tricks! Don't ignore me! Come back!
Princess Bubblegum:  I'm picking up three heart signatures. Ice King must be talking to Finn and Jake. [The girls enter a giant air vent with a forked path.] Go to the right, Lady.
Lady Rainicorn:  gongjunim jeo ddamnage mandeusineyo. ("You're making me sweat.") [They exit the passageway and find a large room with many closed eyes on all the walls.] wa, i bangeun yebbeun sae sorie daehan nae sarangboda deo keune! ("Wow, this chamber is bigger than my love for pretty bird songs!")
Princess and Lady:  Ew.
Princess Bubblegum:  Lady! [Crawls towards Lady.] Lady, are you okay?
Lady Rainicorn:  eu, ne. geogjeong maseyo. jeo wanjeon, wanjeon gwaencanhayo. ja, gayo. ileonabsida! [Falls down] eu, an doegessne. honja gaseyo. jeon jimman doel bbunieyo. ("Eh, yeah. Don't worry about me. I'm perfectly, perfectly fine. Let's go. Get up! [Falls down] Guh. I don't think I will make it anyway. You should just go alone. I'll just be a burden for you.")
Princess Bubblegum:  No, Lady. I won't leave you while you're hurt. Come on. [She grunts as she lifts up Lady. She carries her into a dark room.]
Princess Bubblegum:  What are you playing at, Ice King? [Pants heavily] Three heart signatures. ...Getting closer.
Ice King:  Hey.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Dropping heart monitor] AH!
Ricardio:  Princess! What a pleasant surprise...
Princess Bubblegum:  Ricardio!
Ricardio:  Yes, it is I. Did you find my dungeon stimulating?
Princess Bubblegum:  [Angry] Where are Finn and Jake?!
Ricardio:  What do you see in those two? [Throwing the two in front of her.] A boy... and a dog. You deserve more mature companionship.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Gasps; to herself] Poisoned with Zanoits.
Ricardio:  You see, I thought I only wanted your heart, but I was wrong. I was unfair to you. I want the full package. [Princess Bubblegum looks appalled.] Princess...
Princess Bubblegum:  What...?
Ricardio:  I'm a man now. [Bubblegum repeatedly shrieks in utter terror.] I made myself this body for you, Princess, [The scene goes a flashback where Ricardio is still in Ice King's body.] Synthesized from Ice King's living tissue--his bones broken and reassembled.
Ice King:  [Feigning] It hurt, ooh, boy! How about a hug? Gimme a hug! I need it! [Ricardio steps on him.] Oh!
Ricardio:  Silence, Simon!  All for you, Princess! [He takes Lady away from her.] Now marvel at these powerful, articulate limbs! [He ties Lady in a knot.]
Princess Bubblegum:  [Horrified] STOP!
Ricardio:  Attached with supple and delicate sinews.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Gasps] AH! [In concern] LADY!
Ricardio:  Now, my darling, we can finally be united as man and wife.
Princess Bubblegum:  Okay, Ricardio. I'll do it. I'll be your wife. [Proceeds to take off coat.]
Ricardio:  Ah!
Princess Bubblegum:  [Taking coat fully off] If you can beat me [throws coat aside] at hand-to-hand combat!
Ricardio:  Oh, my... How Valkyrian. Princess, you are absolu-- [Princess Bubblegum punches him, while sweating and panting heavily.]
Princess Bubblegum:  You think we're intellectual equals?! It only took me seconds to get you off your guard! And this "body" you designed is self-congratulatory garbage! See, I know a thing or two about building a body out of biomass, [Detaching leg] and you don't... leave your heart exposed!
Ricardio:  I just wanted to impress you!
Princess Bubblegum:  You didn't. [She pounds Ricardio's face with his own leg.] Get out of my sight.
Finn:  [Waking up] Princess? PRINCESS! RICARDIO IS BACK, HE'S IN THE BLACK ICE CAVE, AND HE'S PEACOCKING HARDCORE!
Princess Bubblegum:  I know... and he poisoned you both with Zanoits, but I took care of it.
Finn:  What happened? How did we get here?
Princess Bubblegum:  I dragged you all here on Lady's back. [Jake wakes up.] It took two days. And another day to make you guys an antidote. [Goes to Ice King.]  And fifteen minutes to build the Ice King a new heart.
Ice King:  Hey, Finn. [The princess reveals Ice King's new heart.] Hee hee!
Princess Bubblegum:  I made it out of Ricardio's sinews... and some toffee and maracas.
Ice King:  Coochie coochie coochie!
Princess Bubblegum:  I'm glad you guys are up. Please make the Ice King leave.
Ice King:  Hahaha! Shooka shooka shooka! [Laughs then claps.]
Princess Bubblegum:  ICE KING, PLEASE LEAVE!!!
Ice King:  [Happily] Ah-hay!!
Princess Bubblegum:  How are you feeling, Lady?
Lady Rainicorn:  jeikeu ggaeeonasseoyo? ("Is Jake awake?")
Princess Bubblegum:  Yes. He's awake. [With regret] Oh, Lady. I should have never put you in danger. [Gravely] I saw on the heart monitor. I didn't know.
Lady Rainicorn:  [Hugging Princess Bubblegum] gwaencanhayo. bimilro han jega jalmosijyo. ("It's fine. It was my fault for hiding it.") [Flies to the three] Jake! (jeikeu!)
Jake:  [Happy] Lady! Oh, Lady!
Lady Rainicorn:  jagiya, na wanjeon jungyohan hal mal isseo. [Jake frowns.] na... ("Honey, I've got something terribly important to tell you. [Jake frowns.] I...") I am pregnant!
Jake:  ...I'M... PUPPIES!?
