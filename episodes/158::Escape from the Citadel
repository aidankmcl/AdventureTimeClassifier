Finn: Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Finn: Look, Jake. [Jake turns his head toward the Citadel] More guardians. The Citadel, I presume.
Jake: Likely so.
Finn: Hey. Do you think maybe one of them could be my dad?
Jake: Eh, I don't think so. We'll probably know when we see him.
Finn: Right, right that makes sense.
Finn: Hey! The Lich again! This must be where the prison cells be at. See? Good riddance to you. I hope you rot forever, you awful jerk clapper! Some people just make the world a worse place to be in just by being around, Jake. [The Lich starts to breathe gray smoke through the pink crystal. Bad omen.] That's right. Bad apples. Lock 'em all up, I say. At the bottom of the ocean where it's too dark to see 'em.
Jake: Look at that weird ol' kid over there. [It closes up on Finn's father.] Man, look at his clo
Finn: Daddy! [Finn immediately jumps towards his father. Jake turns into a slide and slides Finn into the crystal cage with his father inside and falls onto the floor of the pillar.] Aah! [Jake and Finn look up at Finn's dad silently. The take then zooms in on Finn. Then it zooms in on his caged father.] All locked up in there. D-Do you think maybe he's a criminal too?
Jake: [He walks towards Finn who is still on the floor.] Well, it had crossed my mind.
Finn: [He groans while slapping his head across his face, then gets up from the floor.] Jeez, man! Now I wish I hadn't said all that stuff before. Now my heart feels yellow and green. [He makes an angry sound while clenching his fists in the air, then he exhales.] Maybe we shouldn't even have come herewaah!? [Jake is beside Finn's dad while blowing on it. Black fire is melting the crystal cells and pillars.] Jake, what did you do?
Jake: It wasn't me! It came from up there!
Finn: [referring to The Lich] He's melting the crystal all up! [It zooms in on the Lich than other prisoners as Finn talks.] Breaking cats out left and right. Turning cats gray. Did he trick us again? I think he did.
Martin: Hey, kid! [He starts to blow on the crystal that's burning on the crystal close to his hand.] Hey, do me a favor. Get me out of here, huh? [Finn, bearing his teeth, goes to help his father.] This fire smells crazy! 
Martin: Thanks, kid. Now, where'd you guys park your Star Skipper? [As Finn's dad speaks, the guardians fire off their lasers to obliterate the criminals trying to escape. One guardian has fallen in the line of duty and is falling into the depths of space.] This place is coming down quick, and I mean quick, like zip zip. Like wow, like boom boom wow. 
Finn: Oh. We... we don't have a Star Skipper.
Jake: [turns back into his dog form] Also, Finn is your son.
Martin: Whaaat? No Star Skipper?
Jake: Ahem! I said, Finn's your son. He came along way to meet you.
Martin: Son? Oh, hey, good for you, kid. In other news, I still gotta get out of here and the ground is melting. Huh? [He pokes at a pink circle that has formed in the center of the Citadel.] It's all pooling to the center.
Finn: Hey, um... I... I wanted to ask you something. I... well... [Finn's dad jumps into the center.] Hey, wait up! [Jake brings himself and Finn into the center. They all swim upwards.] [underwater] Dad, wait! [At the top of the center, Finn, Martin and Jake gasp for air. Limbs of the guardians are everywhere. A guardian falls and makes a wave.] Dad, I need to ask you - aah! [The wave causes Finn, Jake, and Martin to a rock of the Citadel that is standing as an island. They all catch their breathe. Jake coughs up water.]
Jake: [coughs] [gasps]
Starchie: Whoa!
Void Caster: WEE-nah-nah-gah gah-duh-gah-gah-uah. [laughs]
Jake: [looks around] Finn, I know we normally come out of these things okay, but I got a bad feeling about this. Just promise me that if both my eyes get fried off, you'll fry off your eyes too.
Finn: What? No. [He gets up from the floor] Listen, you don't gotta worry about a thing, Jake ol' pal. [He points upwards] We just need to defeat those five space villains, hijack the shard they're hijacking and sail it home to safety. [Jake looks upwards.] Easy peasy.
Martin: Yeah, Jake, smarten up. Soon as the last guardian dies, the fighting stops. See? He's biting the dust right now.
Finn: Aahh! Uh oh! [he says it 15 times]
Martin: It's-- It's okay. It's okay. [Finn continues then stops.] You just gotta fetch me a gob of that guardian blood, son. It's got that good nooch that keeps us young in the crystal.
Finn: Nooch?
Martin: Come on now, partner. [breath] No dawdling, your old man needs ya. [winks]
Finn: [sighs]
Martin: Atta boy, Flynn! Do it for your old man! Yeah, yeah, just get right in there! Don't be shy. Yeah!
Martin: Hey, good job, son! Rub some of that sap on my leg there. Make sure to get it into the chicken wing hole.
Finn: [shudders] Dad...
Martin: Martin.
Finn: Okay, M-Martin. We need to talk.
Martin: Yeah, okay, kid, but hurry it up. I'm trying to act cool here, but this thing really stings!
Finn: [inhales, talks speedily] Why'd you abandon me in the forest when I was a little baby???
Martin: Oh... I mean... Heh. You know me. I'm a funny guy.
Finn: [groans unhappily]
Martin: I don't know. It was a long time ago. [Martin brushes his hair back while he talks] Who knows, [points at Finn] maybe you left me!
Martin: [sighs] But hey, daddy's back! [grunts] [Martin scoots over to Finn and put his arm around him.] You and me daddy and baby, or should I say...baby and daddy. [He lightly slaps his face. He then moves his leg closer to Finn.] Now slap that sap! [Finn takes some of the sap and spreads it on his leg bone. This renews his veins, muscle, then his skin.] Whoa! would you look at that! [He brings his leg near his face.] Smooth like new. [He holds his boot.] Pssh, couldn't fix the boot too, huh?
Jake: Dude! [Jake grabs at Finn's shirt] S'mores important junk happening! Look!
Finn: It's time to peel bananas on this fool, as a family! [In unison, Jake and Finn flex their muscles.] How about it, Martin? [annoyed] Mmmm! [An explosion throws Finn off balance. He turns around.] Wha?
The Lich: Fall.
The Lich: You are alone, child. [Finn falls and lets out a groan. There is a light now in the dark coming from the small crystal island that Finn and Jake lie on.] There is only darkness for you, and only death for your people. [The Lich points to the shard with crystal and criminals on it.] These Ancients are just the beginning.
The Lich: I will command a great and terrible army; and we will sail to a billion worlds. We will sail until every light has been extinguished. You are strong, child. But I am beyond strength. I am the end. [He reaches to touch Finn. Finn rolls to see the Lich. He balls his hand in a fist.] And I have come for you, Finn. [Finn slaps the Lich with the blood on his hand. The Lich starts to grow veins and muscle. This causes the blackness to go away. The Lich starts to spazz and make bizarre noises as he is tainted by what he is the opposite of: Life. Everyone who was under his spell aren't anymore.]
Finn: [Finn sits up.] Oh, you don't like this stuff, huh? [He reaches for more guardian blood.] Whoa! [His transformation goes faster and Jake wakes up. He falls over, now made of flesh.] Right in the doorbell. [He looks toward his dad.] Dad. [He runs toward him.] Jake, finish off the Lich. I gotta go catch my dad.
Jake: Finn, forget that loser!
Finn: Dad, wait!
Martin: Hey, cool guys. Looking for a new boss? [They look at him and then he winks at them. As Finn climbs up the shard, one of the criminals, a centipede, starts to cut at the shard Finn is climbing up.] Chew faster, that guy's really moving.
Finn: [grunting and disappointed] Dad! Stop!
Jake: [He glances over at the Lich, then he sees Finn in danger.] Finn! [He takes an arm and throws it to help Finn.]
Finn: [shouting] Martin! I won't let you escape!
Martin: [Martin runs toward a Void Caster] Hey, hey, you're a void caster, right? We gotta put some [pats his leg] gas in this buggy.
Jake: Finn! Let go! It's not worth it!
Martin: Oh, gross. Pedal to the metal!
Martin: Hey, what about air?
Jake: It'll be okay, dude.
Finn: [sighs] I mean, at least you finished off the Lich, right?
Jake: Oh, yeah, that's the good news: I didn't have to! One sec. [He runs behind the large piece of crystal.] Up you go! Check this out! [Finn is surprised, Jake shows Finn the new Lich. And so this is how the undead scourge ends.] Brand new baby. The Lich is super cute now, and he smells real neat! [The new Lich sticks out his tongue.] That sap rebooted him or something. [The Lich makes popping sounds with his mouth.] I like him a lot.
Starchie: Over here, fellas! Next stop, the Candy Kingdom. Previous stop, this weird place.
Tree Trunks: Mr. Pig, I think we should get a di
Jake: [whispering] Okay, run. Go, go, go!
Tree Trunks: Oh! [She hugs Mr. Pig while also spilling his coffee. Mr. Pig is smiling.] Oh, this changes everything!
The Lich: Hello!
