Jake:  Hey, what kind of coffee do you want?
Finn:  Hazelnut! Hazelnut! What if your name was "Zelnut"? And then I would be all like "Hey, Zelnut."
Jake:  That's terrible.
Finn:  Hey, Zelnut.
Jake:  Nooooo! Stop!
Finn:  You hear that?
Jake:  Yeah.
Finn and Jake [In unision]:  Susan Strong!?
Susan:  Finn, help Susan.
Finn:  Of course I will.
Jake:  Excuse us for a moment, Strong. [Jake takes Finn aside.] Dude, you know you're my bro, but that girl is bad news.
Finn:  What? Naw.
Jake:  She's crazy, man. She's a fish person!
Finn:  We don't know that!
Jake:  Dude, she tried to eat Peppermint Butler! She'd probably be worse if she was so scared of everything.
Finn:  Whatever, look, she needs my help... and I'm gonna help her whether you're coming with me or not.
Jake:  Oh, I'm coming with you if only to be disruptive and obnoxious!
Finn:  Susan, what can we do?
Susan:  I need your hero heart and your magic.
Finn:  My magic?
Susan:  [Points to fire boiling the water] Magic of red flower.
Jake:  [Scoffs] Fish people.
Susan:  Long ago, my people live in Beautopia... but driven out by Lub Glubs. We come here. We too scared to fight back. This why we need your hero heart. Hyoomans! [Hyoomans gasp.] I'll be back!
Jake:  Fish People! I'll be, um, a dolphin! [Turns his head into a dolphin shape; Hyoomen gasp and Jake chuckles and leaves.]
Susan:  Come on. We swim there.
Finn:  No, you don't understand. I'm not a fish person. I'm human.
Susan:  [Thinking he said "hyooman," she laughs] We go.
Jake:  Grrr...[Susan squashes him down out of the way.] What? Hey, hey. What?
Susan:  [Examining Finn's head] You no gills. [Finn puts his hat back on.] We take boat.
Jake:  Oooh... I'm on a boat with a couple of wackos. Shakin' my hips, and dippin' my fat toe... In the water! Dippin' in the water! This party's gettin' hotter! It's so hot... it's stupid. So where we headed, Susan?
Susan:  There. [Points to a raging whirlpool]
Jake:  Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no, no! No, Susan, no!
Finn:  [Laughs] That was awesome. See, Jake? We can trust Susan. She's on the trolley.
Susan:  Keeps looking for Lub Glubs.
Susan:  [Whispering] No move!
Susan:  Whew, we safe now. [Leaves to steer the boat; Jake looks at Finn.]
Finn:  [Irritated] What?
Jake:  Dude, she's crazy.
Finn:  She's not crazy! She's cool!
Jake:  Whatever, man. This is a crazy cruise, and Susan is our crazy captain... and I'm a crazy clam-shell! Woo-ep! [Morphs his head into a clam and starts dancing] Oh, doing the clam!
Finn:  [Laughs] Quit acting like a clam, you ham.
Jake:  Hey, you hearing that too?
Susan:  Getting close to the Lub Glubs' mash-'em-ups.
Jake:  [Closes clam head] Huh?
Susan:  Behold!
Finn:  Balzacs! 
Susan:  The clashing gates!
Susan:  [Rubbing Jake's head] 'S okay. Susan know when is safe to pass through.
Jake:  Uh-huh. Finn, let's get outta here.
Finn:  Come on. She knows this place. Trust. We're ready when you are, Susan.
Jake:  You know, I could just stretch us over this thing.
Susan:  Go... now!
Susan:  Oh, good. Still got some boat left.
Jake:  She's flippin' crazy! Come on, Finn. Let's bail.
Finn:  Chill out.
Finn:  Alright, Susan, what do we do next?
Susan:  Hmm... never made this far before. Just gotta get past Lub Glubs.
Finn:  Yeah, what are Lub Glubs, exactly?
Susan:  They... umm, look, they like this. [Draws an obscure picture with her finger on the boat wood]
Finn:  Hmm.
Jake:  That looks like... my father. ...Now I'm crazy!
Susan:  Yes. Lub Glubs crazy scary. Hyoomans scared so long. Even Susan. That why glad I meet you. You have brave heart. [Places her hand on Finn's chest and crushes it in her grip.]
Finn:  [Weakly] Thank... you...
Susan:  [Stops paddling] [Excited] We here? We at B-Beautopia! [Susan grabs Finn]
Jake:  Oh, thank Glob.
Finn:  Whoa... Ominous.
Susan:  We's be alls good once bring red flower to city heart.
Jake:  What's making all that swishing?
Susan:  Lub Glubs! They coming!
Jake:  [Laughs] It's just more pool floaties!
Susan:  [Panicking] Shh! Shh! Too many Lub Glubs to fight!
Jake:  Susan! Susan, Lub glubs are just pool toys! [Turns his hand into a pickaxe] Watch, I'm putting an end to all this craziness, with my Pickaxe Hand! [Jake stretches over to a "Lub Glub" with Susan making warning sounds] No more craziness.
Jake:  Ooooh... Jakey beefed it!
Jake:  Bad news, dude. There's only two of us and more than, um, [Looks at his hand and holds out all his fingers] this many of them!
Finn:  We gotta use the fire, like Susan said. Are you okay with that?
Jake:  Yes! I'm okay with that! I'll do whatever Susan says! [Jake is tackled by a Lub Glub.]
Finn:  Susan! We need you! [Piledrives a Lub Glub]
Susan:  [Whimpers] Susan scared... but Susan brave, too. [Grabs lantern] SUUSSSAAANN!!!!! [Jumps and tackles a group of Lub Glubs]
Finn:  Yeah, Susan!
Finn:  Susan!
Susan:  [Tosses the lantern] Finn! Jake!
Jake:  [Catches it] I gots it!
Susan:  Red flower! Throw it to city heart!
Jake:  Finn, win aide to fair Susan! Jake brings the fire!
Finn:  Humans and "Hyoomans" got to stick together!
Finn:  Huh?
Susan:  [Looking at Finn] Hmm.
Jake:  [Grunting] Almost... there... [At the top there is a furnace with straw that says "Light Fire Here."] Oh, so I just toss it in here? Pretty straightforward. Okay, well, here I go. [Swinging the lantern] one, two, three... [The giant Lub Glub grabs his arm and roars] [In a trance] That reminds me of... my mother. [Jake struggles against the Lub Glub and tosses the lantern into the furnace.]
Finn:  It's working, Susan! [Jake comes down.] Jake.
Jake:  Whoa. It is beautiful.
Finn:  You were right, Susan. This place is great. Well, we'd better get home.
Susan:  Finn, you stay.
Finn:  No, I can't. I'm not like you.
Finn:  Susan...
Jake:  [On the boat with pretzels] C'mon, Finn, let's go! I grabbed, like, 100 soft pretzels!
