Ice King:  Good morning, Breakfast Princesses. [He sneakily climbs in through the window. He comes up beside their bed with a jar of honey and a honey dipper. He drips honey on Breakfast Princess's waffles.]
Breakfast Princess:  Huh? [Ice King looks up at them, mumbling incoherently and then suddenly frowns.] Sis, give me the phone. [Toast Princess hands her a phone from beside their bed. Breakfast Princess dials a number.] [talking on phone:] Oh, hey, Finn. I got another Ice King situation here. Oh, yeah? That would be great! Thanks.
Finn:  Ice King?! How many times have we warned you about using love potion?
Ice King:  That's why I'm using honey.
Jake:  Man, who cares if it's honey? You stink anyways.
Finn:  [laughs] Yeah, you stink so much I'm gonna ground you for a week!
Ice King:  What? You can't do that!
Finn:  You're grounded for two weeks!
Ice King:  You're grounded for two weeks!
Finn:  [slowly] Three weeks.
Jake:  Oh, snaps!
Ice King:  Why? I didn't do anything.
Finn:  Four weeks?
Ice King:  [Ice King slaps his face and drags his hands down to his beard while facing the ceiling. He suddenly looks at Finn.] Fine. But I'm only gonna do it for a week.
Finn:  That just grounded you for four weeks.
Jake:  Oh, dang!
Ice King:  [sighs] Okay. [Ice King starts to walk out. He turns back to look at Finn and Jake. Jake gives him the peace sign on both hands while Finn just smiles at him.] What's up with the peace sign?
Jake:  Oh, nah, I'm just trying to show you how many weeks ya got.
Finn:  Get outta here, bubble-butt!
Jake:  Awesome. [Finn and Jake knuckle-punch.]
Ice King:  This is so unfair! They're the ones who should be grounded. Not me! [Ice King shakes his head quickly.] I'm so mad! I could just hit them! If only I could hit them without leaving the castle. [Ice King taps his crown while closing his eyes in concentration. He gets an idea and goes over to his computer. He starts typing.] [reading what he's typing:] H...I...T...M...A...N. [in his own thoughts:] Ooh! [A profile pops up. It is the Scorcher's profile. It reads:
Ice King:  Perfect. [reading what he's typing]
Ice King:  Whoa, you are fast. [The Scorcher looks at him and says nothing.] And quiet. [The Scorcher continues to look at him quietly.] And very good at dramatic silence. I like it. [Ice King gets up from his chair by the computer.] Alright, so, how do we do this? We shake hands or... [The Scorcher's hand lights on fire and Ice King screams in fright. The Scorcher produces a contract from the fires. He hands it to Ice King.] Oh-ho, paperwork! [The contract reads: Who shall I hit?] [reading off what he's writing:] Finn and Jake. [The contract is lit on fire and disappears. The Scorcher emits a black vapor and vanishes, taking the vapor with him. Ice King starts laughing. He flies over to his telescope.] Whoosh! [He looks at Finn and Jake's house. He sees Finn and Jake inside. He also sees the Scorcher outside, looking at them.] A-ha, there he is. Huh? What's he doing? [The Scorcher lights their Tree Fort on fire. The Scorcher then disappears while a fire rages.] What the?! I hired a hitman, not a fireman! [Ice King flies out of his castle.]
Jake:  Dude, you see my masterpiece coming together, right? [Jake's sandwich is almost as big as Jake's face.]
Finn:  Mine's whack. [Finn's sandwich has two pieces of lettuce, a tomato, and a slice of cheese.]
Jake:  Well, put some meat in there!
Finn:  Huh. What kind of meat is that?
Jake:  That's Meat Man's meat.
Finn:  Do you think it hurts Meat Man when he gives us his meat?
Jake:  I don't know. I can't read his mind.
Jake:  [yells:] No!
Ice King:  You guys, I
Finn:  What do you think "grounded" means?!
Jake:  It's wasted, man.
Finn:  Oh, great. Now see what you did to my buddy? So help me, Ice King.
Ice King:  Okay, okay. Goll. [Ice King leaves]
Finn:  It's alright, buddy. We can make another. [Finn puts him arm around Jake to comfort him.]
Ice King:  Sheesh, this Scorcher guy's got some weird ideas about hitting.
Ice King:  Hey, there you are! What's that? I already signed that. [Ice King slaps the paper away.] I thought I told you to hit them, not burn them alive! You big dummy! Goll! It's almost like you want to kill them! Lucky for them, I stopped the fire! [The Scorcher's eyes glow brighter. He runs out while Ice King rambles on.] You know what happens when you're burned alive?! Your eyeballs explode! Bleh! [Ice King turns around and doesn't see the Scorcher.] Hey wha?
Finn:  [while dreaming:] Punch, punch, punch!
Jake:  [while dreaming:] Rainicorn, don't eat 'im. [Jake snores loudly.]
Ice King:  Ice wind! Blow! Blow! Blow!
Jake:  [while dreaming:] Meat Man. Meat Man, I'm sorry, Meat Man, I didn't mean it, man. [Jake snores.]
Ice King:  Finn and Jake, I am just a dream. I was never here...[Ice King flies away.]
Ice King:  Okay, mister, you are really trying my patience. How clear can I be?! All I want you to do is hit them. On the shoulder or something. [Ice King shows the Scorcher by punching him on the shoulder.] Are you even listening? Oh, I get it. [Ice King pulls out a wad of dollar bills.] Here's double the grease to not kill Finn and Jake. [The Scorcher burns the money while Ice King laughs nervously.] You trying to hustle me, Scorcher? Okay, I'll play this game. How about this prized piece for your pad? [Ice King pulls out a deer head mounted to a plaque. He presses a button, and the deer starts singing 'I wanna live live live, I wanna live live live.' The Scorcher burns it.] [yells:] No! Okay, how about these bad boys? Night-vision x-ray goggles. For when you have a lady house-guest. [The Scorcher burns the goggles off his face.] Oh, come on! [Camera shows two Gunters looking at the Ice King, then the other Gunter, then back at the Ice King.] At least renegotiate the target! You can destroy my least favorite princesses. [Ice King holds up a picture of Lumpy Space Princess.] What about Lumpy Space Princess? [The Scorcher burns the picture.] Ghost Princess? [Ice King holds up a picture of Ghost Princess.] I can't even hold her with my love mitts. [The Scorcher burns the picture.] Aw, geez! Uh... [The Scorcher makes a fire in front of Ice King's face.] Oh! AA leg cramp! In my leg! Ow, ow, ow. [Ice King hops over to a door.] Oh, this is so embarrassing. I'll be right back! [Ice King exits.] [Scene changes to room near the entry room of Ice King's castle.] Ow, ow, ow! [Ice King hides beside the door.] Huh. Think, baby, come on. Ah! [Ice King pulls out a laptop computer out of his beard.] Alright, let's hit the hitman, right? There's gotta be a [Ice King searches 'Hitman Hitman'.] Ah! [A profile for 'Blastronaut' comes up. It reads:
Ice King:  Blastronaut. #1 solution for all Hitman problems. Sheesh, 99.95? That's nuts. [Ice King clicks the place order button. A new page pops up that says 'ENTER TARGET NAME:'.] [reading what he's typing:] Scorcher. [A new page comes up that says 'TARGET ACQURIED'.]
Ice King:  Sweet!
Ice King:  No! Come back, you wussy! [ Ice King realizes the Scorcher is watching him.] Ooh, that was weird. [The Scorcher turns his hand into a fist and lights it on fire.] Was that your friend, or something? [Ice King laughs nervously. The Scorcher only gets angrier. Ice King points above the Scorcher.] Look, a super model! Look, a hover-board! Look, the apocalypse! Someone got hit in the boing-loins! Hit in the boing-loins! [The Scorcher squints.] Boing-loins! Boing-loins. Somebody got hit in them. [The Scorcher turns around.] Peace out! [Ice King freezes The Scorcher and flies away. The Scorcher is shown melting his icy chamber.]
Ice King:  Freakin' butt! Butt, butt, butt!
Jake:  Hey, Finn, you awake yet?
Finn:  [while lying down:] I'm trying.
Jake:  I had a dream about Meat Man.
Finn:  Oh, yeah?
Jake:  I think I'm gonna stop eating Meat Man. [Jake turns around just as Ice King tackles him inside. Finn points to him.]
Finn:  You're grounded!
Ice King:  I know, but shush!
Ice King:  Okay, I hired a guy to kill you by accident.
Finn and Jake:  What?!
Ice King:  I thought he was going to just hit you in the gut and make you spit up your lunch. [Finn and Jake stare at him, wordlessly.] Well, I froze him in ice, but I think he's free now 'cause he's made out of fire. Or he commands fire, maybe?
Jake:  Good job. Good job, the Ice King.
Finn:  Oh, my life!
Jake:  C'mon, man, let's get outta here!
Finn:  Jake, do something. He's getting close!
Ice King:  You alive?
Jake:  Uh, I think so.
Ice King:  Whew! That was close.
Jake:  Uh, hey, guys? I don't think this ice dome is gonna last long.
Finn:  What do we do?
Ice King:  [Ice King closes his eyes in concentration. He gets an idea.] Ooh, got it! I'm gonna kill you guys!
Jake:  Hey, I'll kill you!
Ice King:  No, wait a minute, you two. I won't actually kill you. I'm just gonna lower your body temperatures so you seem dead. And after we fool that fool outside, I'll warm you up, good as new.
Jake:  No way, man! [Jake turns his back to the Ice King.] You already messed up enough stuff. You're probably gonna kill us, too.
Finn:  Yeah, we don't trust you!
Ice King:  You'll thank me later.
Ice King:  [to the Scorcher:] Stop! Time out! You don't need to do this anymore! Look! They're dead! I killed them myself! [Ice King starts hitting Finn's ice chunk.] Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead! They're dead. No pulses.
Ice King:  So, uh, looks like, you can go home now.
Ice King:  Oh, yes, of course. [He signs the contract.] There. [The Scorcher burns the contract and disappears in a black vapor. He leaves a paper that reads:
Ice King:  Oh, glad all that's over. [Ice King gets up on Finn and Jake's ice chambers.] Hey, guys, guess what? You're grounded. Underneath my butt! [Ice King laughs.]
