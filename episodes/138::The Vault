Finn: Wha--?
Finn: Wha--?!
Jake: What? Finn?!
Jake: I'm coming! [Jake stretches from his bed to downstairs.]
Finn: She's got me! She's got me!
Jake: [sighs] Yo, bro, you're sleepwalking again! Wake up! [He slaps Finn.]
Finn: Whoa. Jake? Was I...?
Jake: Yes, Finn. Again. Every time youse is screaming about "She's got me!" and all that.
Finn: She's got... Wha?
Jake: Wait, you don't remember? You just woke up, man! Recall it, baby! Come on.
Jake: That's too much; don't punch yourself.
Finn: Eh, it's gone. I don't know.
Jake: [sighs] [He grabs Finn.] You're repressin' the memory, dude!
Finn: I'm what?
Jake: You're hiding whatever she is in a mental vault.
Finn: Oh, yeah. The vault. That's where the stuff I can't handle goes. Kerplunk.
Jake: Okay, so you even know you're doing it? [He lets go of Finn.]
Finn: Yeah. [laughs.]
Jake: Listen, we gotta find out who this lady is. We gotta open the vault a little.
Finn: No, sir.
Jake: This is just gonna keep happening, man.
Finn: It's alright. I'm not hurting anybody.
Jake: Finn, for reals.
Finn: [Finn's entire body shivers and then stops.] NO!
Jake: Alright. Chill, chill. Don't sweat it, man. It's not even a thing.
Finn: Cool.
Jake: Why don't you clean up the kitchen now?
Finn: Okay. I'm sorry I did that.
Jake: It's alright. It's only, like, the fifth room you've train-wrecked this month.
Jake: Wow, that was fast.
Finn: Yup.
Jake: While you were doing that, I downloaded a new game on BMO.
Finn: There's a cricket in here.
Jake: [Jake places BMO on the table and sits next to Finn, giving him the controller.] Huh?
Finn: What is it?
Jake: I don't know. Lady said it's good.
Finn: Hmmm. She likes those games where you're, like, collecting materials to make stationary.
Jake: Naw, this is different. [Jake looks off to the side, unsure.] It's different.
Finn: A'ight, let's peep it.
[Finn presses a button. On BMO'S screen it says: Regression Simulator Press Start.]
Finn: Regression Simulator? Uh, okay.
Finn: Start.
Male Voice: Welcome, adventurer.
Finn: Whoa.
Male Voice: I am the Hypno-Priest. I will be your guide.
Male Voice:  Deep into your subconscious mind. Follow me now, adventurer.
Finn:  [gasps] The vault.
Jake: Go in there, man! Don't be scurred.
Jake: What do you see?
Finn: I see... my past lives.
Finn: I was a comet...
Finn:  A butterfly...
Finn:  A thing... I don't know what that is. Some kind of shape? Or a doodoo in another dimension?
Jake: Do you remember anything about the scary lady?
Finn: Scary lady?
Finn: Yeah. I was her! Except she was a chubby tiger.
Finn: No, no, no, wait, wait, wait. She was riding a tiger, and she wasn't scary.
Boss: Hey, girl.
Boss: Sniffin' around for that chedda?
Shoko: You know it. Got any work for me?
Boss: I might could, but it's a top-shelf shakedown. Know what I'm saying?
Shoko: I can step to that.
Boss: There's a rival camp down river. The leader's got some magic omelette, you know? [eats eye cucumbers] Mmm. You know? The kind you wear around your neck.
Shoko: I think it's pronounced "amulet."
Boss: Oh, don't get fresh with me, girlie. I talk good. Anyway, when I get my hands on that omelet, whoo-hoo! Forget about everything, baby. I'll be the biggest cheese in creation.
Shoko: Sounds cool. I'll take the job
Boss: Shake on it.
Boss: You pull this off, and I'll let you join my gang.
Shoko: Uh... that's okay. I'll just work for coin.
Boss: And, on the other hand, so to speak, if you screw up or chicken out, you're out of the game. Permanently. [He pretends to slit his throat with his finger.] Pretend my finger's a knife.
Shoko: Play dead.
Shoko:  Deader.
Banana Guard: Ah! Another attack!
Banana Guard: My leader! Another attack!
Princess Bubblegum: Bring them inside.
Princess Bubblegum: Hey, you're up!
Princess Bubblegum: I thought you might be hungry.
Princess Bubblegum: So, who knocked you out?
Shoko: Bath Boy Gang.
Princess Bubblegum: Ugh! I hate those boys!
Shoko: Yeah, they stole everything I had, but that's okay. My parents always told me that simple possessions aren't the most important things in life.
Princess Bubblegum: Word 'em up.
Shoko: [Puts her hand on her heart] They told me "all you really need is a good computer."
Princess Bubblegum: Amen. Wait, what?!
Shoko: They traded my arm to some tranch for a computer.
Princess Bubblegum: They what?!
Shoko:  What?
Princess Bubblegum: Parents should protect their children!
Shoko: What? Really?
Shoko: Do you have any kids?
Princess Bubblegum: All the Candy People are like my children, except young Mr. Cream Puff... he's like my boyfriend. Anyway, protecting my people is the most important thing to me. That's why I've got to take down the Bath Boy Gang.
Shoko: You think you can do that?
Princess Bubblegum: I got a plan--a secret, awesome plan. In the meantime, I've gotta cover this radioactive river with candy. Wanna help?
Princess Bubblegum: Thanks for pitching in, Shoko! You can stay here as long as you want.
Bath Boy: Psst! Psst! Shoko!
Shoko: What are you doing here?!
Bath Boy: I'm spyin' on you. Wait 'til I tell boss that you quit the life for a cruddy day job!
Shoko: I'm gaining her trust, you momo. Say... you can help me.
Bath Boy: Huh?
Shoko: Stay away from me you gang boy! Ahhhhh!
Princess Bubblegum: [gasps] A Bath Boy!
Bath Boy: What're you doing?!
Shoko: Be cool!
Princess Bubblegum: That was bananamas! Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Shoko: My parents took me to a dojo when I was little... they never came back.
Princess Bubblegum: Wow. Your parents are the worst... hey, come with me. I wanna show you something.
Princess Bubblegum: My secret project is in here.
Shoko: Whoa... what are they?
Princess Bubblegum: The Gumball Guardians. Wanna help me finish them?
Shoko: Yeah!
Princess Bubblegum: That's it! There's just one last step.
Princess Bubblegum: Hello.
Gumball Guardians: [In unison] Hello, mother!
Princess Bubblegum: Y'all go guard now, and don't let nobody mess with my stuff!
Princess Bubblegum: [To Shoko] Hey, guess what, thanks for helping me make those guys.
Shoko: I like feeling handy.
Princess Bubblegum: I want to repay you for your help.
Shoko: Oh, yeah? You gonna give me that amulet, maybe?
Princess Bubblegum: [laughs] No. No, dude, I made you a thing.
Princess Bubblegun: That's it. You can do it.
Shoko: You made me a man servant?
Princess Bubblegum: [to Shoko] No! In the box.
Shoko: Oh, no...
Princess Bubblegum: What do you mean "Oh, no"? I made you an arm! It's a dang plug 'n' play, girl.
Shoko: No, it's awesome... I can't believe it.
Princess Bubblegum: That's right, I'm a technical wonder-child.
Shoko: Yeah, I know. [She tears up.] I'm sorry, I gotta go to my room for no reason.
Princess Bubblegum: Okay! I thought we could do some two-arm stuff, but... uh, it's cool!
Bath Boy Gang Leader [flashback]: Pretend my finger's a knife.
Shoko: [sighs] I'm sorry, Princess Bubblegum...
Gumball Guardian: Are you okay, princess?
Princess Bubblegum: Ah, jeez, you're so loud!
Gumball Guardian: Are you in danger?
Princess Bubblegum: No! Don't just guard me! You need to protect everyone!
Gumball Guardian: Okay.
Gumball Guardian: I knew it. Princess, you are getting jacked.
Princess Bubblegum: Wha-hut? Whoa, hey!
Gumball Guardian: Halt!
Shoko: Ahhhhhhhh!
Princess Bubblegum: Get her out of there, quick!
Gumball Guardians: Yes, mom.
Gumball Guardian: Uhhh...
Princess Bubblegum: Alright. Take a break for the night.
Jake: How you doin', buddy?
Finn: The past was to be reckoned with.
Jake: That's cool. Whachu' gonna do about it?
Princess Bubblegum: [In German] Hallo, Bubblegum hier... [in English] atonement? Alright, Finn, I'm on my way.
Shoko: Ahhh... look at that. I got a new arm. That would be cool if I weren't about hit my reset button...
Finn: Hey, hey. This way.
Jake: What was th--aww, no. [covers himself with his blanket] Dog-drangit, Finn...
Finn: Okay, here you go.
Princess Bubblegum: Whoa, what?! My amulet?! Wait a second... [gasps] Is that...?
Finn: It's me, Shoko! And PB, you're like a bazillion years old. You're not freaking nineteen! What the heck?!
Finn: Weirdo.
Finn: Heh. My vault feels lighter.
