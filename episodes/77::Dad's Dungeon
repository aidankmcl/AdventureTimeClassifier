Jake:  Alright. Whaddaya wanna see next?
Finn:  A cheetah! A fart!
BMO:  A cookie! An external hard drive! Ooh, ooh! Change into Finn, but give him my body!
Finn:  BMO, your ideas are boring.
BMO:  What? Your head on my body isn't boring! It's weird! [Giggles]
Jake: Alright, I'll try to turn into a cheetah farting. [Turns into a cheetah and makes a long farting sound while moving his face and tail around his body.] I can't do the spots.
Finn:  Sparkles on the house? LET'S SQUISH 'EM!
Jake:  Did you squish the sparkles?
Finn:  No. They're around this holo-message player. It's got a cartridge with it.
Jake:  Oh, snap! [Claps once] Well, plop that cartridge in the slot, playah!
Finn:  Yeah! Okay! [Inserts cartridge into holo-player]
Joshua [On tape]:  [Clears throat] Hello, boys. [Coughs]
Finn and Jake [In unison]:  Dad!!
Joshua [On tape]:  If you're hearing this prerecorded hologram message, it's because I passed on, and my spirit sparkles guided you to its secret hiding place. Right now, I'm holding both of you in my hands. You're both still little squishy babies. [Finn cries and Jake chuckles. Joshua scowls at Finn who is still crying. He lets them both crawl away. Joshua has a disappointed look on his face.] I made you boys something. It's a dungeon. A proper dungeon. Full of evil monsters, traps, and magic. The whole kazoo!
Finn and Jake:  Whoa! Kickin'! Kickin'!
Joshua [On tape]:  Now, this next part of the message is just for you, Jake, so Finn, cover your ears. [Finn covers his hat's ears.] Jake... really, this dungeon is for Finn. I know I won't be around forever, and I wanna make something that will force Finn to toughen up.
Jake:  What?!
Joshua [On tape]:  Now, tell Finn to uncover his ears now.
Jake:  Dude, take your hands off your head.
Finn:  WHAT?!?!
Joshua [On tape]:  Alright, boys. Now to give you some incentive, at the end of the dungeon, I'm going to put the Family Sword. It's made out of Demon's Blood.
Finn:  Whoa, what the--?!
Jake:  Whoa, dang!
Blood Demon [On tape]:  Give me back my blood, Joshua!
Joshua [On tape]:  Kee Oth Rama Pancake.
Blood Demon [On tape]:  Waaaaah!! [Banished by Joshua's spell, he disappears in flames]
Jake:  Whoa!!
Finn:  Geez-louise!
Joshua [On tape]:  The dungeon's eighty paces west of here under a dumb-lookin' rock. And Finn, this dungeon's gonna kick your tail. I bet you won't even get past the first trial, ya whiny baby!
Finn:  What?? What was that about?
Jake:  Uh... [Makes an "I don't know" noise and shrugs]
Dumb Rock:  Duh... duh... du-ugh... duh...
Finn:  Whoo! [He reaches the floor and sees a pile of burgers and a pile of hotdogs. Jake drops down.]
Jake:  Whoa! Burgers and hotdogs! Yeah, yeah, YEAH! [Runs towards the food]
Finn:  Wait, Jake!
Jake:  [Stops] But... burgers and hotdogs..
Finn:  Didn't you say you were hungry for burgers this morning?
Jake:  Yeah, so?
Finn:  And I said I was hungry for hotdogs?
Jake:  Mm-hmm, I remember.
Finn:  I don't think those burgers and hotdogs are burgers and hotdogs at all.
Jake:  Aaaahh...
Finn:  [Slaps Jake] DUDE!! [Notices the next cartridge on a pedestal] Look!
Joshua [On tape]:  Finn, cover up those nubs on your head.
Finn:  Man... again? [Does it]
Joshua [On tape]:  Alright. Hey, Jake, I wanna remind you what this dungeon's for. [Holds up baby Finn who is crying] In order for Finn to stop whining, he needs to be put through a trial that forces him to take charge of a situation.
Jake:  But Dad, Finn's already figured that out. He's a good kid with a kind heart.
Joshua [On tape]:  Remember, Jake, this is a prerecorded holo-message. I can't hear you if you're talking to me right now.
Finn:  [His ears are still covered.] I'm gonna go walk around!
Jake:  Okay!
Joshua [On tape]:  Jake, I need your help. You gotta call Finn a whiny baby.
Jake:  But--
Joshua [On tape]:  Butts are for pooping! Do it for Poppy!
Jake:  [Putting player in backpack] Finn!
Finn:  Over here! [Jake runs towards him.] Check it out, Jake. I found two ways. This way has some kinda flower trap, and that way... has that guy.
Ugly Monster:  None shall pass!
Jake:  Ugh... Let's take the flower path!
Finn:  [Nodding] Mmm.
Ugly Monster:  Wait! Why don't you wanna take my path?!
Jake:  Because... you're super gross, man.
Ugly Monster:  Oh... [Sighs]
Finn:  Cheer up, man. We're only tellin' you you're gross because we're your bros.
Ugly Monster:  Really?
Finn:  Yeah! Bros are real with each other, and you're gross, brother. Take a bath.
Ugly Monster:  Thanks, brother. Hahaha.
Finn:  Hahaha, no probs. [He and Jake enter the Flower Path.] Hey, what did Dad say?
Jake:  Um... He said he's surprised a whiny baby like you made it this far.
Finn:  What?! Why's Dad sayin' all that jive??
Jake:  Mm...
Imaginary Joshua:  Jake, do it for Poppy! [Disappears]
Jake:  [Frustrated sigh] Because... you cry like a baby... Baby!
Finn:  Dude... you're pickin' on me, too?
Jake:  [Nods] [He turns and notices the fruit witches laughing.] Whoa.
Finn:  I don't even cry much. I only cry when it's healthy, like when people die.
Brown-haired witch:  Partake of the fruit... [She gets some of her hair in Finn's mouth.]
Finn:  Pff, blech... If I didn't cry when people died, I'd have a cold butt for a heart.
Blonde witch:  The fruuuuit...
Jake:  [Mocking Finn; feigning crying] Waaaah, I cry when people die. Waaah, I'm Finn.
Black-haired witch:  Partake of the fruit!
Finn:  [Grabs an apple] Maybe I will partake of the fruit.
Jake:  Dude, don't eat that!!
Finn:  Why not? All the people that I care about in this world are being wads.
Imaginary Joshua:  Don't you blow Poppy's cover!
Finn:  Whoa. [He picks up another apple]
Jake:  Time to go, baby. [Jake runs for his life.] Finn, come on!
Finn:  I'm gonna hang here. With these fruit babes. They'll be my best buds now.
Jake:  Rrrr... Yah! [Grabs Finn and runs]
Jake:  There's another cartridge. [Finn makes a long, sad fart noise.] Alright, man, Dad told me not to tell you this, but--
Imaginary Joshua:  Don't tell 'im!
Jake:  You're not real. [Turns the imaginary Joshua into an imaginary Lady Rainicorn which kisses Jake; she disappears.] Dad asked me to call you "Baby" because he wants you to be tough.
Finn:  But I'm tough! My whole body is a callus!
Jake:  [Sighs, grabs Finn and slides down a slanted wall with Finn] On this next holo-message we listen to, when Dad tells you to cover your ears, don't. [Lets go of Finn]
Finn:  [Falling off Jake's grip, laying on ground] Hmmph.
Joshua [On tape]:  Hey, hey! Finn! Jake! You made it past the fruit witches! Hey, did they make you cry, Finn? Huh? Huh? [Laughs] I bet they did. Alright, now cover your ears, Sue! [Jake shakes his head "No."] Jake, I'm almost done with this dungeon. I just have one last monster to fit into this pit I dug. I got him tied up in this building. It's really hard trying to fit him into this pit. He's pretty evil. Ha. [The monster's fingers extend.] You're gonna have a crazy time trying to defeat-- [The monster grabs him.] WAAAAAH!!
Finn and Jake [In unison]:  DAD!
Finn:  [In awe] Dad's sword!
Joshua [On tape]:  Hey, Jake, when Finn finishes this dungeon, play this tape for him...
Jake:  Finn! [The monster beats Finn badly.] Dude! Use your karate biz!
Finn:  Ugh... I-- [The monster hits him again.] I can't, man. I suck. I'm a whiny baby, and I'm fat, and all those things Dad said about me!
Jake:  Dude... Dad loves you!
Joshua [On tape]:  Finn! If you're seeing this prerecorded holo-message, it's because you finished the dungeon that I made for you. I'm proud of you. You're gonna do great things in this world. I love you, son.
Dumb Rock:  Duh... Duh...
Joshua [On tapes, which are being tampered with by Jake]:  I made you boys something. It's babies. Full of babies. ...the family sword. It's made out of--babies.
Jake:  You know I don't think you're a baby, right?
Finn:  Yeah. I know.
Jake:  That sword is sweet!
Finn:  Yeah! I'm stoked to slay some evil with it.
Blood Demon:  Joshua! Return my blood to me, or by demon's law, I will cut off your love handles!!! [Jake begins to activate the player] Joshua, we go way back. Come on! Just give me back my blood!
Joshua [On tape]:  Kee Oth Rama Pancake.
Blood Demon:  NOOOOOOO!!! [Disappears in a wall of flames]
Finn:  Man... Dad was cool.
Jake:  Yeah.
