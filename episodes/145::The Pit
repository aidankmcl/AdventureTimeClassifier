Kee-Oth: [laughs] Your butt is mine, Joshua.
Jake: What? My butt? Weird. Where are we?
Kee-Oth: This is my yoga room. And this is your new home. [Throws Jake into a pit.] Downward, dog!
Jake: Ouch!
Kee-Oth: Welcome to revenge, Joshua. You'll never see your loved ones again. Everything you need for survival is booby-trapped!
Jake: Hmm.
Kee-Oth: Now I'm gonna gank your blood the way you ganked mine.
Kee-Oth: Boo-yeah! How does it feel, dog? How does it feel that I've juiced your body and turned your blood into man dazzle?
Jake: Hmm. Not that great. I feel weird in my skin.
Kee-Oth: [laughs] Wait. Is that it?
Jake: Yeah... but I could get used to this.
Kee-Oth: What? No! You have to suffer.
Jake: Okay.
Kee-Oth: No "okay." When I say something, you're supposed to disagree! Okay?
Jake: Okay.
Kee-Oth: [groans] Sheesh. You're causing tension in my neck and shoulders. I'm gonna go stretch it out. You stay here and suffer.
Jake: Okay.
Finn: Jake? [Holds up the broken demon sword] Drat! Hmmmmmmm. [Looks around] Ah! [Puts the broken sword on his head and gets A phone and dials]
Lady:  ? (Hello?)
Finn: Hey, Lady. Listen. Your husband got abducted by Kee-Oth the demon.
Lady:  ? Jake? (Who are you talking about? Jake?)
Finn: Yeah, your hubby - your boyfriend or whatever.
Lady:  ,  !   !         ? (Oh, what are you talking about! He's my boyfriend! Why are you keep assuming my relationship between Jake weirdly!)
Finn: Yo, my Korean is not that good. Can you just get over here? We need to find a way to Kee-Oth's dimension ..
Lady:  [searches through video tapes] ! .       ! (Oh, right! I got something that can be helpful!)
Finn: Alright. That sounds...affirmative. See you soon. Bye. [hangs up and puts away phone, then sits on treehouse floor and closes eyes]
Jake: [hums, begins singing] Broke up dimension, you're breakin' my heart. I'm lookin' for broke-up girl to break me apart. [stops singing] Just kiddin'. I got a girl! [snaps fingers and produces image of Lady in hand] Lady Rainicorn, yeah! Hmm, that don't look right. [adds mane to image] That's better. [kisses image]
Little Buddy: [off-screen] Excuse me?
Jake: Hmm?
Little Buddy: Down here. Hi!
Jake: [looks down at his seat] Oh my fun. I thought you was a rock.
Little Buddy: I'm not a rock. I'm a Little Buddy. Can you get off me, please?
Jake: Whoops! [gets up] Sorry.
Little Buddy: [stands and begins walking] It's okay.
Jake: Cool. You wanna be friends?
Little Buddy: I'd like that. I've never had a friend.
Jake: Whoa. Seriously?
Little Buddy: My species spends its first twelve years sleeping. I just woke up today! [walks into electric barrier and explodes, leaving shell rolling towards Jake]
Jake: [looks into empty shell] Hello? [sadly realizes it's empty] I'm just gonna pretend you're sleeping. [turns over shell and sits on it, frowning]
Finn: [opens eyes] Whoop! She's here.
BMO: I thought my body was hopping up and down. But I was sitting still.
Lady: [flies in and hands Finn a video tape] ! (I've got it!)
Finn: What is it, Lady?
Lady:     .       .       ! (It's a video tape that was made by Joshua long ago. I remembered it because Jake recorded something else on top of it. Just skip past the front section!)
Finn: What?
Lady:       .. . (Just skip the front section of the tape.)
Finn: Eh, something skip? I don't know. Just play it, BMO.
Joshua: [on screen] Jake? Finn? Jermaine? Whoever is watching this?
Finn: Dad!
Joshua: [standing in front of a cave entrance] I just opened up an unexplored cavern deep in the underground grasslands complex. Please refer to my chart system, okay? I'm in cave 73H. In case I am overtaken by an enemy I need you to retrieve my corpse.
Jake: [on screen] Hey, Lady. You asked me to make you a video.
Lady: [panicking] ! !! (Skip!! Skip!!!)
Finn: BMO! Skip! [covers eyes] Skip!!
Jake: [on screen] ...saying JTD won't change his doggy ways.
Finn: [to BMO] That should be good.
Jake: [on screen] Okay, I love you girl. I hope you liked it. Bye! [kisses camera]
Joshua: [on screen] Over here, you see, the second half of the tablet I believe. Now, if I put this together with mine, I should be able to create a portal to the demon Kee-Oth's dimension and trap him in a circle of holy water. Okay, here we go. [puts tablet pieces together] Perfect. Okay, let's see. [reading tablet] Kee-Oth zaple myrups pama...
Finn, Lady: [groan]
Jake: [On screen] Okay, this is scene one and take one of Heat Signature 2. Ready? Action!
BMO: Father, it has been a year since I was on the submarine, but, I still hear the screams! I was forced to choose; the lives of my men, or the entire planet! Tell me father, what would you do? I'm a mess, man!
Shelby: Wait, what do I say? Mmmm, Check please-
Jake: No!
Finn: Hold on, BMO, I feel like we should watch more of this video for clues, but you gotta promise me that I'm not going to see more weird Jake stuff.
Lady:         . !            . . (I don't think there's any more weird Jake stuff.  Really!  But I can't promise anything, as I haven't seen this tape for years! Sorry for that.)
Finn: Okay, high-five! Play it, BMO!
Jake: Hmm, guess what, Lady? This dirt dog needs a bath!
Jake: Wawoo!
Lady and Finn: [Screaming]
Kee-Oth: [Screaming] This stinks!
Jake: What'a mean?
Kee-Oth: Come on, Joshua! Back in the old days, you would have been up here trying to take me apart!
Jake: Uh, what? That's my dad, Joshua, back in the old days.
Jake: I'm his son, dude.
Kee-Oth: Shoot.
Kee-Oth: Where is he?
Jake: He's dead, dude. Don't make me get emotional about it.
Kee-Oth: Then why you being such a wimp then? Come on up here and beat on me like your dad would.
Jake: Okay, that's weird.
Kee-Oth: What's weird?
Jake: You want to get beat up? That's weird. I'm not doin' your weird biz.
Kee-Oth: You won't fight?!
Jake: Nope.
Jake: What the!
Samantha: Hi. I'm Samantha.
Jake: I'm Jay T.the Dog. I'm Jake.
Kee-Oth: Only one can survive my pit! This bozo tried stealing my blood too! So youse better duke it out, and see who gets to live!
Samantha: But I haven't seen a man-dog in years! And now the universe has dropped one into my arms!
Jake: Whoa, lady, no way. This boy's got.
Samantha: But fate has brought us together! The stars have paired you with a goddess.
Jake: I like the way you talk, but you are crazy.
Kee-Oth: Kill or be killed, you two!
Samantha: Yes, if I'm so crazy, then let's fight!
Jake: [whispering] No, girl, we can bounce outta here. My friend Finn will save us any second now.
Samantha: I don't wait for rescue. I conquer till I am conquered. By love... or by the hand of an adversary.
Jake: Well, I guess we're gonna have to fight then.
Kee-Oth: Okay, take your time. I gotta do my daily sun salutation.
Kee-Oth: [grunts] Release me, Joshua! [grunts] I'll show you!
Kee-Oth: Dude, your blood is harsh!
Joshua: That's because I've been drinking so much holy water. It's in my blood, sucka! And naturally, I gotta go to the bathroom like crazy. Be right back!
Kee-Oth: If I can't suck you, I'll suck myself's blood.
Kee-Oth: Hehehe...Taste it, scrub! [Joshua runs back into the room and splashes his holy water on Kee-Oth.] AUGH!
Joshua: [Joshua picks up the sword.] Man, I can't believe it...I gotta wee-wee again!
Beemo: Would you like to rate this video?
Finn: No time, Beemo. [Turns to Lady] Let's go find the cave from the video. Maybe we'll find more clues there.
Lady: !      ! (Wait! I must cast a protective shield around you!)
Lady: .   . (Done, now you're good to go.)
Finn: Kee Oth Zaple Myrups Rama Mancakes?
Finn: Whoa.
Finn: Jake? [He sees Kee-Oth doing his sun salutation.] Yeesh.
Kee-Oth: Eh?
Finn: Jake?
Jake: Finn, yes! Help me!
Lady: Jake!       ! (Jake! Why is that ugly chick hugging you!)
Jake: This isn't huggingit's fighting! Fighting!
Finn: Jake, what do I do? Should I kill him?
Kee-Oth: With what?
Finn: With this! [He pulls out a pink Demon Blood Sword out of his pack.]
Kee-Oth: Demon blood...
Finn: That's right! Demon blood beats demon!
Jake: No, that is not correct!
Kee-Oth: Hahahaha! Oh yeah! Gimme that blood, stupid!
Finn: Lady! Don't break the circle of protection!
Lady: ! (Of course I won't!)
Finn: [Kee-Oth continues to try to suck Finn's blood.] Aw geez, he's sucking my sword off it's hilt!
Kee-Oth: Yeah, hahaha! Your circle can't stop my sucking! Now I have your demon blood as well!
Finn: Except it's not demon blood! It's a frozen grape juice that was blessed by the priest.
Finn: [Flashback to Finn grabbing the sword out of his freezer, and taking over to Shelby to "bless".] Bless this sword, fodder.
Shelby: Mmm, check please!
Finn: [He licks the sword.] Mmm, grape-y!
Kee-Oth: Wait... [His stomach starts rumbling.] Aaaaaah!
Jake: My blood! Woo!
Samantha: Coward!
Jake: Woop! Hey, hey! Lady! [He walks over to Lady and gives her a hug.]
Finn: Let's go, bros!
Jake: Samantha, you can come too, I guess.
Samantha: Very well.
Samantha: You've returned me to my world, so I recant my oath to destroy you.
Jake: You made an oath. Okay.
Samantha: [She starts walking out the door.] Let's fight again some time.
Jake: Nah, I'll just stretch into a tree.
Samantha: Hmm. Took you long enough to stretch outta that pit. [She runs off.]
Lady: ,    ?      ! (What is happening? Did you fall in love with that lady or what!)
Jake: Pshh, please! Not even.
Lady:        ? (Then why did you spend that long time in the pit?)
Jake: Uh, because... Kee-Oth was right there! An-and there were traps! I didn't have no blood this whole time, so I'm totally out of it. [He falls to the ground.]
Lady, Finn: Jake!
Jake: Woo...Sorry, I got a little light-headed.
Lady: ,  .  . (Ah, you little troublemaker, I love you, honey.)
Jake: I love you too, Lady.
Finn: Yo, guys, I still love Flame Princess.
Jake: Okay, big hug!
Finn, Jake and Lady: Hug!
