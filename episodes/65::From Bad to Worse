Finn:  Hurry, Lady!
Finn:  [Breathing hard] It's happening again.
Princess Bubblegum:  That's right, Finn.
Finn:  Princess!
Princess Bubblegum:  The zombie infection has spread across the kingdom once again, ...and once again, it's all my fault.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Narrating] I was testing a sample of the zombie flesh I had saved when Cinnamon Bun came into the lab. He said he was hungry.
Cinnamon Bun:  I'm hungry.
Princess Bubblegum:  Not now, Cinnamon Bun. I'm busy. [Turns her back on Cinnamon Bun to work with some chemicals]
Princess Bubblegum:  [Narrating] And that's when I made my mistake. I should have paid more attention to that poor fool. [Cinnamon Bun starts messing with the Candy Zombie flesh and eats it] The Candy Zombie flesh he ingested was highly contagious. [CB groans, falls to floor behind the counter, and begins groaning violently]
Princess Bubblegum:  Cinnamon Bun? Where did you... [Zombie Cinnamon Bun lunges from behind the counter at Princess Bubblegum] EEEEHHHHH!!!
Cinnamon Bun:  Sugar!
Princess Bubblegum:  I escaped, but I wasn't able to stop Cinnamon Bun from infecting the rest of the kingdom. The good news is I still have all my notes for making the antidote formula.
Finn:  Oh, sweet!
Princess Bubblegum:  Let's board up the windows then we can get started.
Finn:  Princess!!
Princess Bubblegum:  Don't worry, Finn. You have the notes to my formula. Just let Science do the work. Science... is... MAHHRRAHHH! [Turns into full zombie]
Finn:  Nooo!!!
Lumpy Space Princess:  Get that zombie outta here!
Lumpy Space Princess:  Aw, nah! I am not getting eaten by zombies tonight. [Starts to board up the windows. Zombies begin to peek through, and Lumpy Space Princess smashes them with a hammer] Get the lump outta here!!! Ahh! Ahh!
Finn:  Princess!
Jake:  These notes make no sense. It's all gobbledy-gak.
Finn:  Alright, we'll each make our own version of the formula. One of us is bound to get it right.
Finn:  Hmm?
Jake:  Hey, Princess Bubblegum trained her rat to dance. Neat.
Finn:  [Laughs] Done.
Lumpy Space Princess:  Done!
Jake & Lady:  Done!
Finn:  Bubblegum, I'm comin' for you!!!
Finn:  Mine first.
Winged Zombies:  Sugar!
Finn:  Cram!
Starchie:  Oh, my, that's a lot of zombies down there. Starchie's glad he's up here. [Starts to sing and dance; a winged zombie swoops down and grabs him] Dang it!
Jake:  Let's get out of here!
Finn:  Stairs! [They all run upstairs to the top room of a tower]
Finn:  Jake, try yours and Lady's next!
Lumpy Space Princess:  Move outta the way! My formula is going to cure the zombies because I made the prettiest formula.
Lumpy Space Princess:  Oh. My. Glob. Look at those luscious lips. I gotta go lick up the rest of that formula! Aaaaaaah! [Runs out of the tower and outside] My formula! [Pushes her way through the zombie horde] Formula! [Begins splashing the formula on her face] Oh, my Glob. Yes, I'm gonna be hot! So freakin' hot! [Her lips begins to swell and she laughs] Yeah!
Finn:  LSP, look out!
Lumpy Space Princess:  Huh. I know you want this body, but you can't have it! You can't have it! [They swarm her and bite her turning her into a winged zombie, she flies up and presses her faces against the tower window]
Finn & Jake:  LSP!
Finn:  Dang it, Jake. We only got one formula left. Try yours and Lady's.
Jake:  Right.
Jake:  Let's hope this works.
Finn:  Wh-... where now?!
Jake:  We can barricade ourselves in the lab!
Finn:  Did anyone get bit?
Jake:  I think we're good. That door is made out of candy steel.
Jake:  What's the matter? [Sees the zombie and screams]
Finn:  Jake! Did it get 'cha?
Jake:  I think I'm okay. It's just a little bite.
Lady:  Jake!
Jake:  It's all good, Sweetie. I can stretch forever. Hehehehe...[To Finn, under his breath] Hey, let's hurry up with that antidote, huh, pal? [The infection spreads ups his arm as Jake runs and continues stretching his arms] Whooa...
Finn:  Okay, let's see here...[Looks at Princess Bubblegum's notes]
Jake:  [Running] You should try one of them books. Over there by the lab rat.
Finn:  Ha! Yeah, okay. [Runs overs to the books and opens one] Yes! This book has a glossary of symbols.
Jake:  [Running] That's great, buddy.
Finn:  Jake, I think this little guy has serious dance fever.
Jake:  Don't come near me, Sweetie! [Gasps] Oh, man, I'm outta shape. I think I should just stay in here, ya know. Just in case. Ya oh.
Jake:  Hurry, dude!
Finn:  I am! Okay, Jake's probably going turn into a zombie, but that's okay. I just have to figure out this formula.
Lady:  Jake?
Lady:  Jake!
Finn:  Hang on, Lady! I'll have the antidote soon, but whatever you do, just don't let him out. He may look like the Jake that once loved you, but he's just a zombie!
Lady:  aniya. yaeneun nal saranghae. ("No. He loves me.") [Lady lets him out, he cuddles her face and bites her]
Finn:  Hey, Lady... [Screams]
Finn:  The book!
Finn:  [Sighs] Sorry, everybody. Sorry, LSP, PB, Jake, LR, peepee poopoo doodoo. [Sighs and looks at the lab rat] You know, it's funny; I don't even know your name.
Finn:  Yeah? What is it, girl? [The lab rat points at the label] "Sci... ence." Your name is "Science"? Could it be?
PB:  Just let Science do the work. Science... is... MAHHRRAHHH! [MY RAT!!!!]
Finn:  Hmm...
Finn:  Here goes nothing.
Jake:  Finn!
Finn:  Jake!
Jake:  You did it! I huh, uh... [See the zombies around him who swarm him and turn him back into a zombie]
Finn:  Don't worry, Science. I've got a disgusting idea. [Pour the antidote over himself and the zombies break through the shower and begin to bite Finn] OH, MY GLOB!!!
Jake:  Sorry about biting you, sugar.
Lady:  [Hugs Jake] nan nega ggaemuleo juneun ge joha. ("I like it when you bite me.")
Jake:  [Laughs nervously and blushes] Oh.
Princess Bubblegum:  And so the Royal Day of Apologizing has come to an end. [Princess Bubblegum takes a medal from a Banana Guard] And now I shall present the Royal Medal for Heroic Bravery. Finn the Human.
Finn:  Yes.
Princess Bubblegum:  Would you please move out of the way?
Princess Bubblegum:  Science the Rat, you have served your kingdom well. [Puts medal on Science] Citizens of Candy Kingdom, rejoice!
Citizens:  Huzzah!
Princess Bubblegum:  Rejoice!
Citizens:  Huzzah!
Princess Bubblegum:  Rejoice!
Citizens:  Huzzah! Huzzah!
