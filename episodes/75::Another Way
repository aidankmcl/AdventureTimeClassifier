Head Clown Nurse:  Who wants a cookie? [She moves it around, making airplane sounds.] Milk-dipped chocolate chip cookie?
Finn:  No thanks.
Head Clown Nurse:  Now, come on, Finn. You have to eat. Open Sesame...
Finn:  Uh, Jake, can't we get rid of these Clown Nurses? They make me feel ridiculous.
Jake:  No way, man.
Jake:  Well, now you know we can't jump off of birds. [The fat Clown Nurse waves a cookie around, mimicking airplane sounds and plops it into Jake's mouth.] I paid them up front. They don't leave until the job's done. Besides... [He honks the big Clown Nurse's nose.] They're funny. [He honks the big Clown Nurse's nose again, and she farts this time.] [laughs] Look, she just farted.
Head Clown Nurse:  Time for our love therapy.
Finn:  Wait, what are they doing? [The Clown Nurse starts smooching Finn's bandaged foot.] Whoa! Stop!
Head Clown Nurse:  [gasps] Oh my! Did that hurt, dear?
Finn:  NO!! I just don't want you kissing my toe!
Head Clown Nurse:  Now, now, honey, you gotta understand. This is the only way to "foo-foo" your boo-boo.
Finn:  What does that even mean??
Jake:  I don't know... but I'm feeling better already. Ah. That tickles.
Big Clown Nurse:  You want me to stop?
Jake:  No, keep going. [The big Clown Nurse continues smooching Jake's toes.]
Finn:  [Beat] You're gross, man. [He notices a page in the Enchiridion.] Look! Deep in the forest of trees, there's a Cyclops whose magical tears can heal any wound. See? See?
Head Clown Nurse:  Maybe you should leave the medical decisions to the medical professionals, and my professional prescription is... your toe needs crazy smooches! It's the only way! [laughs]
Finn:  Huh? Wha?
Finn:  Wait! Wait! Wait! There's another way! There's my way! Let me show you my way!
Finn:  Ahh! Let me go! [The head Clown Nurse is still smooching Finn's foot. He screams and then blacks out. Finn starts having a crazy nightmare about running from Clown Nurses. He trips and sees the head of the head Clown Nurse.]
Head Clown Nurse:  It's the only way! [laughs]
Head Clown Nurse:  [softly] It's the only way!
Finn:  MY WAY!!
Finn:  Hmmm...
Tree Stump:  Ring, ring! Look, there's only two choices, bro. Take your pick. There's the path on the left, Hair Fall-Out Path. No more hair again, ever! Or the path on the right, Smelly Path. Makes you smelly forever. Hoohoo, you won't believe it.
Finn:  Isn't there another way?
Tree Stump:  Nope.
Finn:  But what if I just went--
Tree Stump:  No, that's it! You have to choose! There's no other way! Choosing is the only way. Choosing--is the only--way.
Head Clown Nurse:  It's the only way! [laughs]
Tree Stump:  Hey, listen man, the Smelly Path's not actually that bad!
Finn:  NO! I choose MY WAY!! [He kicks the sign off of her head.] My way.
Bush:  Ring ring. Hello, dummy police? Yes, there's a strange dummy lurking around my house. Okay, yes. Thank you. Goodbye.
Finn:  Wha...? [Beats] I need to cross the river. The Cyclops is over there.
Bush:  You can't cross this river. It's impossible! Look! The current is so fast, it'll turn your butt inside-out for real, doofus. And the water's so acidic it'll crump your boat in half. It's like orange juice. It's gross. There's a bridge, but it's a trap! Plus, the water's jamming with electric eels. Wow, so weird. Anyway, that's it, there's no other way around, you dummy.
Finn:  But I need to get across.
Bush:  Listen what I'm telling you. There's no way. ...Ugly tramp.
Finn:  Glob, Glob it, Glob it, Glob it...
Bush:  Huh? What are you saying? "Globbit, Globbit"? Who's Globbit?
Finn:  MY WAY!!
Bush:  Glibby glob, man! You're crazy! We're not even half way across! You gotta go back, man! It's the only way, you ugly fat-smelling fat-head!
Finn:  NO, MY WAY!! [Frustrated, Finn tosses the now-barren bush all the way across the river. Then he dives in. He emerges from the river, screaming and steaming from the pineapple juice-like water. He then happens upon a strange little man standing next to a wagon with watermelons in it.]
Finn:  [panting] MY WAY! [He quenches the acid by smashing one of the melons over his head.] Oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob.
Pan:  Uhh, excuse me, friend. [Finn blabbers his lips together.] You're pretty tall, can you reach up there and get my wheel for me? Gotta get these melons home to my wife. You know how it is.
Finn:  [panting] MY WAY! [He hurls the wagon down the hill. The wagon shatters as it hits the ground, and the melons tumble down the hill.]
Pan:  Watch out, Rainy!
Pan:  [gasps] Rainy!
Finn:  Whoops. Uh... man, I'm real sorry.
Pan:  Yeah? [sobs] No doy... friend.
Finn:  But... I can still help. I'll fix your house for you.
Pan:  Just get out of here! Leave us alone!
Finn:  Uh... wh... I... [sighs]
Pan:  Psycho fink.
Finn:   I was wrong. Was I wrong? No. Yes... Yes... I was wrong. How could it be? I trusted in my guts, but ended up all nuts. I was wrong. How could it be? Listened to my brain, but ended up insane. The melons rolled...over that lady. I went too far. How could it be? [Finn puts his hat back on.] How did I go... too far? 
Forest Cyclops:  Hey! I know you're here for my magical tears, but you won't have any, because I never cry.
Finn:  I don't want 'em anymore.
Forest Cyclops:  What? Stop lying. You're here for my tears, aren't you?
Finn:  No. I hurt a small, hairy man's wife. I just wanna go home.
Forest Cyclops:  You're just trying to make me feel sad so you can steal my tears when I cry... but I've got a heart of stone, buddy. I'm EVIL!
Finn:  Dude! What's wrong with you? I said I don't want your tears!
Forest Cyclops:  YOU'RE LYING!
Finn:  I'M NOT LYING!!!
Forest Cyclops:  [Beat] You stink at lying.
Finn:  Fine. Whatever, man. Have it your way.
Forest Cyclops:  Okay... I WILL HAVE IT MY WAY!!
Finn:  Huh? [The Cyclops pounds him into the ground.]
Forest Cyclops:  Beg for mercy, or I'll kill you!
Finn:  [mutters]
Forest Cyclops:  Whuh... What?
Finn:  [mutters]
Forest Cyclops:  What? I can't hear you.
Finn:  I said... MY WAY!!
Finn:  Magical tear drops. [He pulls off the bandage. His foot has been healed completely. He wiggles his toes.] My way can still work! Yeah!
Rainy:  Huh? I'm okay.
Pan:  Yay!
Bush:  Huh? [The bush takes root, and all his leaves regrow.] Whoa!
Tree Stump:  Huh? Whoo-hoo.
Ham Sandwich:  Yeah!
Jake:  Oh, yeah. Huh?
Head Clown Nurse:  Have you come crying back for your proper treatment, Babylips?
Finn:  Kiss that!
Head Clown Nurse:  Oh, my! You look horribly injured! My kisses will make heal you. [She smooches the Cyclops' eye.] Now how does that feel?
Forest Cyclops:  Bittersweet.
Finn:  Hey, man. You want me to heal your toe with my magical goo?
Jake:  Ah, no thanks. I think the kisses work better. [To nurse] Excuse me, don't stop, keep going, please. [The big Clown Nurse resumes smooching Jake's foot.]
Finn:  You're gross.
Jake:  Hey! We all have our own ways.
Finn:  [realizing] You know what? You're... right.
