Jake:  BMO, turn the music down. BMO! Turn it down!
BMO:  [Increases volume.]
Jake:  [Groans] Come on, BMO you're messing up my game!
BMO:  [Continues dancing]
Jake:  Hey, dude, can I borrow that paper?
Finn:  Mm-hmm.
Jake:  [Whistles; rolls up paper; hits BMO with it] Bad computer! No! No! [Music stops.] Now go sit in the corner and think about your life.
Snorlock:  [Roars]
Finn & Jake:  Snail attack!
Finn & Jake:  Aaaaaah! Oof!
Snorlock:  [Crying and squirting fluids on Finn & Jake who are both coughing and gagging]
Finn:  Oh, sick!
Jake:  Ugh!
Finn:  Dude, how do you fight a snail?!
Jake:  Hold on! [Stretches his arm and grabs a saltshaker] I got this! [Grunts, brandishes saltshaker] Don't make me use this, man!
Snorlock:  Salt?! But I heard you guys were heroes.
Finn:  We are heroes. We thought you were trying to attack us. Why'd you break in here all mad, squirting that juice all over us?
Snorlock:  It's not mad juice. It's sad juice. My name's Snorlock, and I'm sa-a-a-a-d! [Sobbing]
Finn:  Stop squirting slime! Just tell us what's wrong!
Snorlock:  I need a girlfriend. I have no one to love.
Finn:  Jake, hero huddle. [They huddle] What do you think?
Jake:  I think our house is all jacked up.
Finn:  Yeah, but he's just an innocent goober looking for love.
Jake:  Yeah. Okay, let's help him. But he's got to lay off the house.
Finn:  Right! All right, man. We'll help you hook up as long as you--
Snorlock:  Yay!
Finn & Jake:  Whoa! Aaah!
Jake:  Lay off the house, man!
Snorlock:  [Sadly] You guys... won't help me? [Whimpers]
Finn:  All right! all right! We'll help you, dude! Just put our house back!
Snorlock:  Okay! Right after I get a girlfriend.
Finn:  Aw! All right, you big crazy. It's a deal.
Snorlock:  [Giggles]
Finn:  Jake, what time is it?!
Jake:  I don't know, but you're probably going to say...
Finn & Jake:  Lady time! [LADY TIME screen card; Wolf whistle]
Finn:  Okay, Snorlock, if you want a lady, you have to be yourself.
Snorlock:  How do I be myself?
Finn:  Uh, how does he be himself, Jake?
Jake:  Just do whatever you want, man, as long as it comes from the inside.
Snorlock:  Like sad juice?
Finn & Jake:  No!
Jake:  You keep that stuff inside you, brother. You just got to talk to 'em.
Snorlock:  Oh. I never done that.
Jake:  Finn, you see any hot mamas?
Finn:  [Looks through telescope] Ummm... Baaaaaam!
Jake:  Go talk to her!
Snorlock:  Uhmm...
Jake:  Go talk to her!
Snorlock:  [Sighs] Okay.
Snail Lady #1:  Oh! [See's Snorlock and inhales gut] Hello.
Snorlock:  Hi.
Snail Lady:  Mm. You seem like a reasonable male. We should go to a movie sometime.
Jake:  He's got this.
Finn:  Yeah.
Snorlock:  [Getting nervous] Uhh...
Snail Lady #1:  I like old movies. [Chuckles]
Snorlock:  Uh..uh uh...
Snail Lady #1:  Um, are you okay?
Snorlock:  [Screaming] Aaaaaaaaah! Girlfriend! Girlfriend!
Finn & Jake:  Aaah!
[Scene: inside of shaking house, objects are falling and breaking.]
Snorlock:  Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend!
Finn:  Dude! our house! We got to do something!
Jake:  Relax. I got it. Snorlock! Hey, Snorlock. You okay, buddy? Went a little nuts there, guy. You got to get that under control, 'cause you're scaring ladies and jacking up our house.
Snorlock:  I'm sorry. Are you gonna leave me?
Jake:  Aw, who could leave you? Come here, you big hot mess. [Hugs]
Finn:  Break it up, you two! We have ladies to attend to!
Jake:  Yeah, the ladies.
Snorlock:  Talking to ladies is hard.
Jake:  No, it's not. Check it out, Snorlock. Finn, you be the guy snail, and I'll be... [Shifts to appear like a lady snail] the chick snail.
Finn:  Ugh! gross, Jake!
Jake:  Come on, man. We're just pretending. Do it for love.
Snorlock:  [Whimpering]
Finn:  Okay. I'll do it for this guy.
Snorlock:  [Gasps happily]
Finn:  [Clears throat] What's up, lady snail?
Jake:  [High-pitched voice] Well, I'm just sitting here thinking about mating with snails.
Finn:  No! I can't do this, man! I-am-out!
Snorlock:  I'll mate with you.
Jake:  [Normal voice] We're just role-playing, buddy.
Snorlock:  Aww.
Jake:  Here, Finn. This time you be the chick and I'll be the snail dude.
Jake:  [Shifts into Guy Snail; flexes pecs] Hey, baby. What's up?
Finn:  Uh... WHA!
Jake:  Mm-mmm! [Sniffs Finn's hand] mm-mmm! [Deep voice] Girl, you smell good. Did you take a bath in rainbows and cupcakes?
Finn:  [Growing more uneasy]
Jake:  Say "yes"! [High-pitched voice] Say "Yes"! [Deep voice] Say "YES"! [High-pitched voice] Say "Yes"!
Finn:  Okay! Yes!
Jake:  [Normal voice] See, Snorlock? Talking to ladies is easy. Just act like me.
Snorlock:  Uh... girl, you smell good.
Snail Lady #2:  You can smell me?
Snorlock:  May I smell you more?
Snail Lady #2:  Uh, okay.
Snorlock:  [Sniffs] Cupcakes...
Snail Lady #2:  Uh, I have to go.
Snorlock:  Did you take a bath?
Snail Lady #2:  Don't ever talk to me again.
Snorlock:  Please don't go! Don't go! Aww.
Jake:  Aw, it's okay, buddy. Come here and give us a hug.
Snorlock:  Man, I wish you guys were ladies.
Finn:  Uhh.
Jake:  Stay focused, Snorlock. You have any cool talents that ladies might like?
Snorlock:  No.
Jake:  Umm, hey, Finn, teach him how to use swords. The princesses always love this one.
Finn:  [Preforms stabbing motions and flips] Yah! yah! yah! yah! Yaaaah! hyah!
Jake:  Do you think you can do that, Snorlock?
Snorlock:  I don't know.
Jake:  Hmm. Maybe you're musical. Can you do this? [Inhales deeply, begins beatboxing] Try doin' all that.
Snorlock:  Hmm. [Grunts then begins beatboxing and twirling swords]
Finn & Jake :  Whoo-hoo! yeah!
Snail Lady #3:  My word, Eleanor! What is that alluring sound?
Eleanor:  I have no idea.
Jake:  Yeah, Snorlock! Show us that talent!
Finn:  Whoo-hoo!
Snail Ladies:  Oh, my! What is that? What is that wonderful sound? Do I see swords?
Finn:  Jake, these chicks look pretty serious.
Jake:  Let's just let Snorlock do his thing. Go to it, buddy! [Grabs Finn and sits on top of observatory boat]
Snail Ladies:  [Snorlock beatboxing continues] Ahh! Ooh! Ahh.
Jake:  Look at him go! Bringing in the ladies.
Finn:  Uh, he's bringing in a lot of ladies.
Snail Ladies:  [Crowding around Snorlock and begin grinding on him] Mm!
[Scene: inside of shaking house, objects are falling and breaking, BMO is sliding around.]
Finn & Jake:  [Both screaming]
Finn:  Snorlock! These ladies are ruining our tree house! Stop!
Finn & Jake:  Whoa!
Jake:  Wedge, dude!
Finn:  [Grunting] [Sticks sword into house's top to pull it off Snorlock]
Jake:  [Grunting] It's no use, man. It's stuck with snail slime.
Finn:  [Gets shoved back and forth between the Snail Ladies]
Jake:  Finn! Aah! [Also gets shoved back and forth between the Snail Ladies]
Finn:  How are we gonna get our house back?
Jake:  [Jake flashes back to the salt shaker, cue Snorlock yelling "Salt!"] Dude, I'm going in.
Finn:  Wha? Jake! No! You'll get slimed or grinded on!
Jake:  [Runs and then jumps into the house window] Hmph!
Finn:  [Gasps as he sees what Jake has] [Nods]
Jake:  Snorlock, I'm gonna give you till the count of three, mister!
Jake:  One, two, three!
Jake:  Fine. I didn't want to have to do this. [Taps out a single grain of salt onto his palm] [Inhales deeply and then blows it in Snorlock's direction]
Snorlock:  Aaaaaah! [Bucks the house off his back] Ow! ow! Owwwwwww!
Snail Lady #4:  Oh, my gosh! He's naked!
Snail Ladies:  [Laughter]
Snorlock:  What? I'm naked? But I've never had a shell.
Jake:  Snorlock, you never a shell? That means you're not naked. You're a slug!
Snorlock:  Me, a slug?
Finn:  Yeah, man. That's why you have trouble with snail chicks. You need slug chicks.
Snorlock:  [Pouting] I don't known any slug chicks.
Slug Lady:  Actually, I-I'm not really a snail. I'm a slug. My shell's made of peppermint.
Snorlock:  [Laughs happily]
[Scene: Snorlock and Slug Lady smooching]
Finn:  That's gross!
Jake:  I don't know why they have to make out so close to our house.
Finn:  I don't know. Come on, let's finish rebuilding it. I got some ear plugs you can borrow.
Finn:  Where's that music coming from?
BMO:  [Watching the two slugs] Go! go! go! go!
Finn:  BMO! Get over here and help us rebuild the tree house.
Jake:  Yeah. You live here, too!
BMO:  [Increases volume]
Finn & Jake:  Oh, BMO!
