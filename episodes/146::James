Finn: Jake...? Jake? [opens storage closet] Hey, man.
Jake: Hey, dude.
Finn: You still thinking about...
Jake: Yeah.
Finn: Yeah? Me, too. Princess Bubblegum's ready for us, so we should go.
Jake: Okay. Just give me a few more months in here and I'll be ready.
Finn: It's okay, man. Justjust play it off. Just make aa normal face. [passes hand over face] See? Normal face.
Jake: [passes hand over face] [he starts crying]
Finn: [starts crying]
Princess Bubblegum: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming. We may begin the ceremony!
[Time card: ONE WEEK BEFORE]
Finn: Thanks for bringing us along on the trip, Preebs.
Jake: Yeah. It's unfortunate we can't enjoy some of these cool things we're passing by, but I guess we could do that the next time we're in the Desert of Wonders, whenever that is!
Princess Bubblegum: We're on a mission to collect samples only. I want to start colonizing this area by the end of the year.
Jake: You are killing me, PB!
Princess Bubblegum: James, give a readout on fuel.
James: Right away, Princess. [makes whirring noises] Boop! Boop! Boop! Boop! Beet! We have a surplus of fuel, so after we collect samples, we may explore.
Finn & Jake: Yeah!
Jake: I'm glad James is on this trip. Hey, James, thumbs up, buddy!
James: [returns the thumbs up while making robotic noises]
Finn: Heh. Dude, James is kind of, uh, goofy.
Jake: I wasn't gonna say anything, but yeah. Maybe when we get to know him better, it'll be charming.
Princess Bubblegum: James, slow down. We're here.
James: I'm registering mondo mega rads down there. I'll ready the radiation suits upon landing.
Princess Bubblegum: Excellent. Take us down.
James: Hold on to your sack lunch!
James: [walking robotically] Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt!
Princess Bubblegum: Okay. You guys collect as many surface samples as you canrocks, plants, dirt, anything.
Jake: Mostly looks like it's just dirt here.
James: This'll be fun. [picks up a rock] Jake, open up the basket. I'm gonna make a shot!
Jake: Do it!
James: Chk-chk! Whoop! [throws rock]
Jake: Ha ha! [rock hits his helmet] [growls quietly]
James: Wah-wah!
Princess Bubblegum: [lifts up a rock, revealing some green substance] Hmm. [pokes it with a stick]
Princess Bubblegum: Aah! Ach! Brownstadt!
Princess Bubblegum: Guys, run!
Princess Bubblegum: James, speed up that sack lunch!
James: [accelerates] Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt!
Princess Bubblegum: Ugh! [starts up the engine]
Finn: Ugh! Everyone okay?
Jake: [pointing behind Finn] [stammering fearfully]
Finn: Huh? [turns around, seeing lots of monsters climbing on the vehicle's windshield.] Oh, my garf! What are they?!
Princess Bubblegum: Uh, they're toxic creatures from another time. [checking monitor] Okay, let's seesuspension's all donked, navigation's lost, and the ship's legs are kaput. We're dead in the water.
Finn & Jake: [gasp]
James: [makes whirring sound] Chk! Ah-oogah!
Princess Bubblegum: Oh, yuck! Come on! Manners! [presses a button, engaging the blast doors] Gotta brain out the situation.
[A digital clock displays 6:45 and counting.]
Princess Bubblegum: Those goo monsters will barf their way through the hull in mere minutes. Finn, what should we do?
Finn: [taken aback] Uh... let's radio for help.
Princess Bubblegum: Good idea, but looks like the radio's kerplowed.
James: [whirs] I can fix that radio. Mrow-row-row! Pling! [pulls out a coin] With this! It's a lucky coin! Bam! [places coin on radio] When I bust out my coin, great stuff happens, like when I was chosen to go on this mission with you guys! [giggles]
Jake: Mnh. Mnh. James, that's not helping!
Finn: Don't panic, baby.
Princess Bubblegum: Yes. James is very resourceful. He'll work it out.
James: [picks up coin] Vrrt! Veet! Vrrt! Vreet! Vrrt! Gzzzh! Jzzt! Bwr! [turns screw with coin] Look, Princess! I invented a coin-operated coin screwdrive-e-er!
Princess Bubblegum: See what I mean? Good job, James. [gives thumbs up] Come on, guys. Let's take inventory of the emergency gear.
James: [opens radio] Lucky coin strikes again!
Finn: Hey, Preebos, I know things seem bad, but I'll figure out a plan.
Princess Bubblegum: I know, Finn.
Jake: Dude, I found us some flares! I saved us!
Princess Bubblegum: Right on!
James: Hey, dudes, the radio is fixed!
Jake: Good Grod! I love you, James!
Princess Bubblegum: I knew you could do it, James!
Jake: You know, James, I wasn't sure about you at first, but you're okay.
James: Thanks, Jake. I wasn't sure about you either. [clicks tongue]
Princess Bubblegum: James, the radio's still not working! I'm not getting any signal.
Finn: [opens radio] What the skunk?!
Finn: James, it's all sanched up!
James: James is like, "Wha?!" It was working just a second ago, I swears! I went, like, "Choo-choo-choo!" and the radio was like, "Pch-choo-whichoo-whichoo-whichoo-whichoo," and then I was like...
Jake: [to Finn] I take it back. [shape-shifts to look like a bird] This guy's totally cuckoo! This is my cuckoo face.
Princess Bubblegum: He did his best, you guys.
Finn: Right, right. Okay, time for plan B. James, pass me them flares.
James: Chk-oo! Boop! A flare for m'liege.
Finn: [opens flare box and sees that it is empty] James, where are the flares?!
James: What?! Maymaybe they're, uh, invisible flares.
Jake: [growls in frustration] Finn, PB, can I speak to you in the other room, please?!
Finn: You want to do this trust-huddle style, buddy?
Jake: [nods] Hm.
Princess Bubblegum: So what's all the hubbub?
Jake: What's up with that James dude?
Finn: Yeah. Do you think James could be breaking things on purpose?
Princess Bubblegum: No. James wouldn't do that.
Jake: Wake up. Dude's a saboteur.
Princess Bubblegum: It's not James.
James: What's not James? [beat] I got lonely up front. I wanted to see what y'all are up to.
Finn: Hey, that gives me an idea.
James: Me, too! Vrrt! [laughs] Just kidding! I don't have any ideas.
James: Diversion. [pushes buttons] D-d-d-d-d-d-diversion! Time to set up a diversion.
Jake: You see anything, brudda?
Finn: [looking through binoculars] Ah, I got bunkus. Wait. If we jam up to that cliff face, I think we can climbwhoop. [sees monsters] More goo bros.
Finn: What the?!
Princess Bubblegum: That won't hold them for long.
Jake: It can't end like this. I got a lady and five kids! I thought I'd outlive at least one of them!
James: Here, man. Take this. [offers coin]
Jake: Your lucky coin?
James: Yeah, man. It always keeps me calm.
Finn: [accusingly] Who shot that flare, James?
Princess Bubblegum: We don't have time to point fingers.
Finn: [growls] You're right. There's only one way out of this jam. One of us has to eat the big one so the others can survive.
Finn: And I'm gonna be that one. I'll run up there and get the creatures to chase me, and while they're busy noshing on my teen-boy body, you three can climb to safety. Don't try to talk me out of it. I got crystal certainty. This is what it means to be a he
Jake: Wha?
Princess Bubblegum: [knocks out Jake too] James. We need to talk.
[From Finn's POV: Finn opens his eyes, just barely, and hears Princess Bubblegum talking to James.]
Princess Bubblegum: So, what do you say?
James: Sure thing, Princess! [breaks off a corner of his head, hands it to Princess Bubblegum, salutes, and jumps down the hatch] Byong!
Finn: Ugh! Huh? Why didJake?
Princess Bubblegum: [grunts]
Finn: Whwhere's James? [looks back at the ship]
Finn: James! [falls unconscious again]
Finn: [wakes up] Aah! James, look out! Ohh. PB! What's going on?
Princess Bubblegum: Finn, I need to explain something really heavy. I was the one who sabotaged all your escape plans. I calculated the chance of success for every possible escape plan, and none of them were going to work. You said it yourself: there was only one way out. Someone was going to have to eat the big one to save the others. James did something really noble to save us.
Finn: But I wanted to do it. Why didn't you let me?
Princess Bubblegum: There's a reason. With this sample of James, I can clone a new one. He's candy, but you're not. I can't clone another you.
Finn: Whoa.
Princess Bubblegum: I made the best choice available.
Princess Bubblegum: James served the Candy Kingdom on a dangerous mission, and even though he is gone and it's super sad, I would like to honor James... with this new James I whipped up in the lab!
James' Clone: Jeet!
Princess Bubblegum: Here you go, James[pins on him a Medal of Valor] an award for bravery. Let's hear it for James! [claps]
Candy People: [cheering]
Finn: Is this right or wrong? I can't tell.
James' Clone: Hey, cool. Did I do something cool? Do I do something cool?
Jake: I don't know, man. [walks up to James' clone] Here's your coin, James.
James' Clone: Wow! This day keeps getting better and better!
Jake: Ehh.
