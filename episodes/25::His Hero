Swamp Giant:  AAAAH!
Finn:  Last chance, Swamp Giant! Tell us where you hid the Mini Queen!
Swamp Giant:  NEVER!!
Finn:  Huh? [He finds the Mini Queen.] Hi, Mini Queen! Jake! I've got 'er!
Jake:  Then hold my hand, dude! [Finn does so.] Whoooop!
Swamp Giant:  Aaaah! Oof!
Finn:  My inflatable angel.
Jake:  Heh heh heh. [They jump off the giant.] How's the Mini Queen?
Finn:  I dunno. Can't understand a word she says. [The Mini Queen promptly writes a message on Finn's hand that says, "THANK YOU 4 SAVING ME, XOXO CALL ME." The Mini Queen shapes her antennae to look like a heart.] Aww! My pleasure, ma'am! I just like beating up evil! [Finn performs a "handshake" with one of her antennae. She squeaks.] Okay... Didn't... catch any of that either.
Jake:  [Sniffs] Mini Queen must've stepped in somethin' funky. [Sniffs] No... It's not tiny feet I'm smelling! This way! [He sniffs the ground and follows a scent. The scent leads him to a sword.] Whoa!
Finn:  What?
Jake:  [In awe] Do you know whose sword this is?! This is the sword of Billy!
Finn:  Billy?!
Finn and Jake:  [Singing] BIIILLYYYYYY!!!
Young Billy:  Nothung!
Finn:  Oh, yeah! That was the most mathematical thing ever!
Jake:  Oh, yeah! Hahaha! He fought a bear!
Finn:  This is so cool!
Finn and Jake:  Whoa!
Finn:  It's Billy's legendary crack!
Billy:  [Sighs] Hello.
Finn:  [Whispering to Jake] It's him! It's him!!
Jake:  [Whispering] I know, I know! Be cool!!
Billy:  Yep. It's me.
Finn:  Man! I'm such a huge nerd for you! Please take us on as hero apprentices!
Billy:  What for?
Finn:  So that we could learn to kick evil's butt... just like you!
Jake:  I wanna be the dog version of you!
Billy:  Ahh, that'd be a waste of time.
Jake:  Heh. Yeah. I-I'm a little paunchy... but I could do some sit-ups!
Billy:  No, I was talking about beating up monsters. It's as pointless as a dog chasing his own tail.
Jake:  Heh. See, that's where you're wrong... 'cuz watch! [He tries to catch his tail, of course to no avail.] Ah... ah...
Finn:  What do you mean, "pointless?" We just saved the Mini Queen from a monster!
Billy:  You know where she is right now? She's probably being eaten by a different monster. She's probably dead. [Finn gasps.] In my youth, I was much like you. Motivated. Headstrong. Wore a silly, little outfit. Even had a magic dog.
Jake:  [Scared, yet smiling] Heh... I'm gonna pass out... [Falls backward]
Billy:  All my life, I've beaten on evil creatures. [Deep sigh] But new evil keeps popping up. Kicking their butts was a hopeless effort!
Jake:  What other way is there?
Billy:  Nonviolently. Help people by being active in your community.
Finn:  Nonviolently?? [Sighs] I gotta try being nonviolent... the Billy way...
Jake:  Me, too!
Finn:  Billy, I won't let you down!
Jake:  I love you, Billy! I got a secret crush on you, Billy!
Finn:  This is gonna be tough, Jake. I'll have to suppress my every warrior instinct.
Jake:  Relax. It'll be easy not to beat up on monsters and still help people.
Cobbler:  Help! Help! [Finn and Jake notice his cries.] A monster! [The cobbler runs into Jake's leg. Jake retracts.] Oh! Thank goodness! Heroes! I'm being chased by a horrible Dragon! Please, please help!
Finn:  Oh, uh...
Jake:  Oh...
Cobbler:  Act quickly! He's almost upon us!
Jake:  [Straightforward] Sorry. We don't beat stuff up anymore.
Cobbler:  No, but please! [Stammers frantically]
Finn:  [To Jake] Dude. We gotta do something to help him.
Jake:  I could teach 'im how to not be such a spaz.
Finn:  [To cobbler] Hey, Mister. Besides being chased by a monster, what else is wrong?
Cobbler:  Well... I've been running all day. I guess I'm pretty hungry.
Jake:  Say no more. [Walking away, pulling Finn with him] Come on, Finn.
Cobbler:  Where're you going?!
Jake:  To make you somethin' to eat!
Cobbler:  AAAH!! NO!! HELP!!
Finn:  I still feel weird about not fighting off that dragon.
Jake:  Trust me. This is a way better way to help 'im. [Yelling out] Gruel! Get your free gruel!
Lady:  [Walking up to stand] What's this all about?
Finn:  Free gruel, ma'am. I can't beat monster butts, but I can beat your hungry guts. That's for sure!
Lady:  Hahaha! [Eats gruel] I didn't throw up! This gruel is very adequate.
Finn:  [Victoriously] YEAH!!!
Finn:  This is great, Jake!
Jake:  Yeah, we're really helpin' people!
Finn:  Whoa! Look who it is!
Jake:  Dude! You're alive!
Cobbler:  [Angrily] No thanks to you two!! That dragon chased me for two days!! ...And then I was lost for... uh, three days... and then I... I fell under a spell of a beautiful enchantress for... [Unsure] a week? So that's two, plus three, plus a week
Jake:  [Deliberate] Dude. Gruel.
Cobbler:  Oh, thank you! [Eats it] Hahahaha! Hahaha. [His hand suddenly becomes encased in stone.] AAAH! WHAT'S HAPPENING?!
Finn:  Huh? [Holds up glass with potion in it] Oh, that's probably the stone skin potion I added to the recipe. It gives your body the power to grow armor.
Cobbler:  Wha? Ah... uh?!
Jake:  Dude... how much of that potion did you use?
Townsperson:  AAAAH!! MY TUMMY IS BREATHING FIRE!!!
Finn:  [To Jake] Geez... I thought people would like that.
Cobbler:  Why?! Why would anyone want that?!
Finn:  So you can defend against evil monsters!
Cobbler:  You're supposed to beat up monsters so we don't have to defend ourselves!
Finn:  No, see? I'm helping you nonviolently!
Cobbler:  Helping?! I can't even move my hands! I'm a cobbler! How'm I supposed to cobble with these useless chunk mitts?!
Finn:  Sooo... the village needs the help of a new cobbler, eh?
Finn and Jake:  [Thinking] Hmmmmmm...
Cobbler:  WHAT?! NO
Finn:  Alright! We're cobblers!
Cobbler:  No, you're not!! You're just watching my shop while I go to the dermatologist! [Leaving] And don't try to cobble anything!
Jake:  [To Finn] What does "cobble" mean, anyway?
Finn:  I think it has something to do with shoes...
Fine Lady:  [Entering shop] Excuse me! Can you help me? I need a broken heel fixed. I'm going to a fancy funeral.
Finn:  [Taking shoe and heel] Of course I'll help!
Finn:  There! [Rolling over to lady] Whah! [He puts the shoe on her foot.] Pa-kow!!
Fine Lady:  Ah!
Finn:  Now you can fight off evil if it shows up at the funeral!
Jake:  [To Finn] Did you fix that shoe with a magic nail?
Finn:  Maybe... [The shoe arms axes, an extra blade, and a lasso.] Whoa!
Jake:  Cool!
Fine Lady:  I cannot go to the funeral in these!
Cobbler:  [Entering shop] Hey, everyone! I'm back from the doctor! [The lady's shoe lace lasso's the cobbler.] WHY?! [The lace forces the cobbler to the ground.]
Fine Lady:  [To Finn and Jake] ...And I'm not supposed to bring a guest.
Cobbler:  [To Finn and Jake] GET OUT!!
Finn:  Apparently, I suck at being nonviolent.
Jake:  Dude, suckin' at somethin' is the first step towards bein' sorta good at somethin'. You and I are like little baby Billys right now, and we're "sucking" on our first bottle of nonviolent milk!
Finn:  [Frustrated sigh] Totes. I'll stop "pooping" my diaper.
Jake:  Whoa, what?!
Townsperson with fire-spitting belly button:  HELP! I NEED MEDICAL HELP!!
Finn:  Medical help? Hmmmmm...
Finn:  How can we help?
Lumpy Space Princess:  I want surgery to make my body hot.
Finn:  Yikes...
Lumpy Space Princess:  Yeah. I know I'm already pretty smokin'... but I bought this swimsuit, so I need a swimsuit body.
Jake:  [Whistles] [To Finn] You up for some serious plastic surgery?
Lumpy Space Princess:  Aw, yeah! This body's hot! And powerful! [Suddenly, machine parts form on her body like a cyborg.] Huh?! Aw, what?! [Her legs turns into a wheel. She makes pained noises.]
Jake:  Dude, did you use a magic nail again?
Finn:  I've got three left!
Lumpy Space Princess:  Ohhhh... [She gains a robotic eye.] What did you do to me??
Finn:  We transformed you into a cyborg fighter! That's hot, right?
Lumpy Space Princess:  No one thinks this look is hot!!
Cobbler:  [To Lumpy Space Princess] Oh, my laces! You're the most beautiful [He suddenly gets shot with a laser from her robotic eye.]
Lumpy Space Princess:  Huh?!
Finn:  ...Jake...?
Jake:  ....Yeah...?
Finn:  I think us being nonviolent... is hurting people. Man... Billy is gonna be so bummed out...
Jake:  Not if we run away, Finn! We'll have to live in halfway homes and be cannibals! We'll survive!
Finn:  I just wanna sit here and moan.
Jake:  Then I'll moan with ya, buddy.
Finn:  [Moaning] Thaaaanks, buuuddy...
Jake:  [Moaning] Yoooouuu'rrre weeeelcooome...
Old Lady:  AAAH! AAAH! HELP ME!!
Swamp Giant:  Hahaha! Relax! I'm just gonna grind you up!!
Old Lady:  AAAH! AAAH!
Jake:  [To Finn] Aw, man, this grass-bag again?? [Heroically] HEY, EVIL-DOER! [Weakly] Um... could you keep your evil-doing quiet? Finn is dealing with some heavy stuff over here.
Swamp Giant:  It's not evil!! When they get this old, they wanna be ground up!! Hahaha! Right, you old bat?!
Old Lady:  Help!!
Swamp Giant:  Right?!?
Old Lady:  Oooh!! Aaah!!
Finn:  Huh?? A fist raised in righteous anger?! Oh, no! It's my fist!! I've gotta think of a way to save this old lady without punchin' this guy in the face!! Hmmm...
Swamp Giant:  [To Old Lady] Yeah, you wanna get ground up, right?!?
Finn:  [Furiously] WRONG!!!! [He punches and uppercuts the Swamp Giant, saving the Old Lady.] [Quietly, to Jake] I couldn't think of anything...
Old Lady:  Whooo! [Falls in Finn's and Jake's arms]
Finn:  POOP!! I saved her with violence...
Old Lady:  What's your huff, son?
Finn:  The greatest hero in the world told me to help people without being violent... and I promised I would do that and not let him down... but I did let 'im down.
Old Lady:  Stuff and nonsense! You sure helped this old gal out! And you did it with violence! Like a true hero, you were born to punch evil creatures! [Punches Finn] Just like I was born to be an old lady! Don't deny your rowdy nature, paladins! [Starts dancing] And don't take advice from old people! [Continues dancing]
Finn:  Yeah... Yeah...! YEAH!! That old lady has a point!
Jake:  Wait, didn't she say not to take advice from old peo
Finn:  It's all so clear to me! Back to the cave of Billy!!
Jake:  Cha!!
Finn:  It's us again.
Jake:  And we've got exciting news!
Billy:  Aw, I don'tI don't wanna buy anything.
Finn:  Billy, an old lady told me that I shouldn't listen to you because you're old. Also, that I should do what I was born to do... which is kickin' buns.
Billy:  Don't you see how pointless it is? You know what's probably happening to that old lady right now? She's probably dead!
Jake:  She's right here. [Turns around, revealing her]
Old Lady:  Hello!
Finn:  We saved 'er, Billy.
Jake:  You saved 'er.
Finn:  I saved 'er, Billy. I saved 'er using violence. And that's not a bad thing, Billy! This old lady is alive because of these! [Holds up fists and leg] And look how happy she is, man! She's elated!
Billy:  Hmm. Perhaps you're right. [Pained groan] It's... it's as if your words are filling a void in my very being... You wanna watch? [He reveals a literal void in his stomach. Finn and Jake gasp. The hole starts filling up with body mass.] Nothung! [The sword comes back once again.] Finn and Jake... truly, you are my heroes. [They laugh excitedly.] Now you're freakin' me out... [Finn, Jake, and the old lady climb on Billy enthusiastically. Finn and Jake are taken off.]
Jake:  We're his heroes!!
Billy:  Huh... Hello.
Jake:  Ha! Haha! I love you, Billy!!
Billy:  Get outta here!!
