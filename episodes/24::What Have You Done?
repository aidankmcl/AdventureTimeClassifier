Finn:  Our secret mission to capture the Ice King is underway. Though I probably shouldnt say stuff like that out loud.
Ice King:  [Singing] Who is it? [Starts shooting ice lightning] Zap zap zap zap zap zap zap! [Sees a can on the ground] Ooh, someone left me a gift. Peanut brittle? But I'm on a diet. [Shakes can, snickers and opens the can; Jake pops out and takes his crown]
Jake:  Should have stuck to your diet!
Ice King:  [Throws can on the ground] Oahh! Finn, you have destroyed my faith in canned peanut brittle! Zap! [Nothing happens] Oh, no, my crown has all my powers in it!
Finn:  [Tackles Ice King with a giant wrapper strip] Wrap attack!
Jake:  [In baby talk] How about I swaddle you up like a sweet baby.
Finn:  We finally captured the Ice King!
Jake:  [With Ice King tied to his back] Why'd we do this again?
Finn:  Princess explained it all when she sent us on the mission, remember?
Princess Bubblegum:  Go capture the Ice King, and bring him to me.
Jake:  Hmm... That didn't really explain anything.
Finn:  I'm sure she's got a good reason.
Finn:  Where is everybody?
Jake:  Yeah, this place is deserted, except for that guy.
Princess Bubblegum:  Ich bin hier, Finn. ("I'm in here, Finn.")
Princess Bubblegum:  It's me, the princess. Did you bring him?
Finn:  Sure did.
Finn:  So, what did the Ice King do to--
Princess Bubblegum:  [cutting him off] Ah-bababap! No time! Now quickly, with me!
Princess Bubblegum:  Ttubllaw!
Stonesy:  What's the password?
Stonesy:  [Laughs] Oh, you got me! [Opens his mouth into a doorway]
Finn & Jake:  Secret door!
Princess Bubblegum:  This stairway leads to the dungeon where we'll toss that lousy Ice King!
Finn:  What awful thing did he do to get tossed in there?
Princess Bubblegum:  Chhh, he didn't do anything. Not a thing.
Finn:  Wha?
Princess Bubblegum:  It's a long story, Finn. You see, the Ice King...
Manfried:  [Over an intercom] Princess Bubblegum, you're needed at once in the Grand Hall.
Princess Bubblegum:  No! I need more time! [Flips over a table]
Manfried:  [Hanging over on a tree with a bullhorn] Gosh, I'm sorry.
Princess Bubblegum:  Alright, alright, I have to go. You two just guard the Ice King until I return [Creepily] and be prepared to make him howl with pain.
Finn:  You got it, princess!
Ice King:  Oh, this is a total rook!
Jake:  Settle down, prisoner! We gotta record your belongings. One magical crown, [Whispers to Finn] probably stolen.
Ice King: I didn't steal it! I made that item! ...Made it with the magic that I stole! So hand it over, or I'll strike menacing poses at you! [Starts striking poses and Finn sprays him with a hose]
Finn:  Cool it, inmate! [The water begins to whip Ice King]
Ice King:  These bars can't hold me forever! Hey there's only like two of 'em. You fools have no business guarding prisoners.
Finn:  Oh, yeah?! Well how 'bout these helmets we found? And we got the Oculus of Rehabilitation!
Ice King:  Hmm?
Oculus:  Be better!
Finn:  And the shelf of penitence!
Ice King's crown:  [Sobbing] I'm sorry...I'm so sorry...
Ice King:  How about you just hand me my crown. I'll create some ice bars.
Jake:  [Running with the crown] Okay!
Finn:  No, Jake! It's a trick.
Ice King:  I'm toying with you, ha ha, psychologically. [laughs]
Finn:  Finished!
Ice King:  So what am I being charged with?
Finn:  Umm...
Jake:  Five counts of jerkateering. Ha!
Finn:  Yeah, what does it matter?
Ice King:  Gah! Of course it matters! The way things work is first, I transgress your meaningless rules and then you maliciously persecute me!
Finn:  That makes sense. You do bad stuff, we punish you.
Ice King:  [Pokes Finn's face] Fool! You have disrupted that order, for--are you ready for this?--I have committed no recent crime!
Finn:  Really? Umm...
Ice King:  [Laughs] I'm rockin' your worldview!
Finn:  Jake, he is starting to convince me we're doing a bad thing.
Jake:  Dude, [Licks him] be calmed by my saliva and think of all the terrible things he's done.
Finn:  Yeah... yeah! You're still a jerk that deserves to be in jail.
Ice King:  Oh, yeah? You know who really deserves to be in jail? I will show you the true jerks! [Pulls out a mirrored covered with a blanket behind his jail cell bunk bed] Behold! [Lifts the blank off the mirror but in doing so extinguish the candle in the cell]
Finn:  Uhh, it's too dark.
Ice King:  Behold! [Brings the mirror into the light but it shatters at the bottom when he slams it on the floor] Wha, Behold! [Holds it in the air but it falls apart, Ice King groans and gasps and walks up to the cell bars with a mirror piece in his hand and puts it in Finn and Jake's faces] Behold the true jerks!
Finn:  The jerks are us? Jake, am I going crazy? It seems like the Ice King is right about this. But if he's in the right, that means we're in...
Jake:  The Candy Kingdom!
Finn:  No, it means much, much worse.
Finn:  On your feet.
Ice King:  [Gets out of bed] Is it time for my hour in the yard, boss?
Finn:  No, we're letting you go. We decided that it's wrong to imprison you.
Ice King:  This is a trick, huh?
Finn:  Get out of here before I change my mind!
Ice King:  [Walking out of the cell] There must be someone waiting outside to beat me. Ooh, is that my crown over there? [Goes offscreen]
Jake:  [Sighs] I'm glad that's all taken care of.
Finn:  No, quite yet.
Jake:  Awww...
Finn:  Sorry, but since we're the bad guys this time, we gotta go to jail.
Jake:  This sucks.
Ice King:  Hey!
Ice King:  Get out of my room!
Finn:  You're still he-- [stutters] ...Just get out out of here, man!
Ice King:  So, you're really breaking me out?
Finn:  Like I said, it's wrong to imprison you.
Ice King:  [Tearing up] You mean, you believe me? Oh, can it be? Has all the hatred between us transmuted into something more? A friendship? A best friendship. [Sticks out fist for a fist tap] Knucks? [Finn slaps his fist away] Oh, ho ho, slaps in disgust, eh? Let's call them "Slappy D's"! Okay, see you later, my bosoms!
Finn:  I am no man's bosom.
Ice King:  Cast "Detect Secret Door"! [He shoots a magic blast and a tunnel opens under the stairway] Success! [Runs away into the tunnel] Wa ha ha ha!
Princess Bubblegum:  Sorry for the delay.
Jake:  Man, there are a lot of secret door around here.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Puts on pink iron gloves] And now, Ice King, prepare to howl with [Sees he's gone] pain?
Finn:  Wow, she's so proud we did the right thing, she almost looks enraged.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Takes off the gloves] Where is the Ice King?
Ice King:  Finally! Freedom and friends FOREVER!!!
Princess Bubblegum:  What have you done?! [Flips over a table and snarls]
Finn:  What have we done?
Princess Bubblegum:  I'll show you. [Carries them away]
Finn:  AHHH!!!
Starchie:  Heah, even old Starchie's sick.
Princess Bubblegum:  A plague of Freezer Burn Flu.
Finn:  Ice King did this?
Princess Bubblegum:  Well, yes and no.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Narrating] It happened 3 days ago.
Ice King:  Hey, hey, Princess, check out my new trick! [Starts rubbing flakes out of his beard] It's snowing it's snowing for you!
Princess Bubblegum:  [Narrating] We don't think he was trying to spread disease, but soon the entire kingdom was infect by his beard flakes.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Narrating] Through my research, I quickly discovered that the only way to cure my people was to obtain the pained howls of the Ice King himself.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Narrating] But when I pleaded with him directly...
Princess Bubblegum:  Please, I beseech your aid. In the name of common decency!
Ice King:  So let me get this straight... You're hitting on me.
Princess Bubblegum:  No!
Lady Rainicorn:  , !          ! ("Are you joking? You are not even worth my Lady's disdain.")
Ice King:  I think I heard the word "Virile" in there. Oh, she is definitely hitting on me.
Princess Bubblegum:  No!
Lady Rainicorn:    ! ("No!")
Ice King:  Be gone, you biddies!
Princess Bubblegum:  [Narrating] He had his chance to help and he did nothing!
Ice King:  Oh, my gosh, she came to me this time.
Princess Bubblegum:  I had no choice but to try and take his wails by force.
Jake:  By getting us to beat the tar out of him.
Finn:  I can't just beat up the Ice King for nothing. That's against my alignment.
Princess Bubblegum:  I know, I know. You're right. [Starts to cry]
Finn:  But I'll get him to give up those howls. Voluntarily. I swear it.
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, thank you, Finn. I... [Cries]
Finn:  [Places hand on her face] Shhhh...
Jake:  Dude, how are we gonna get those howls?
Finn:  Oh, I gotta plan to trick him, but you won't like it.
Jake:  That sounds ominous. I don't like it!
Finn:  Ice King, come forth!
Ice King:  I'm coming forth! Hee hee, is that the voice of friendship I hear? [Walks in the room with a board game] So, are you fellas ready for game night?
Finn:  Game night? Well, that's weird.
Ice King:  What? Why?
Finn:  You do know how friends act, right? You've had friends before.
Ice King:  I... yes?
Finn:  Yeah, so you know how friends are always howling in pain for each other.
Ice King:  Yeah... right! Everyone knows that! [Laughs awkwardly]
Finn:  [Holds up the sound device] Will you howl for me, pal?
Ice King:  Oooh, of course, friend. Awoo-hehehehe! Oh, I've got the sillies! I couldn't possibly without giggling uncontrollably. I'm just so giddy about you being here! [Laughs, falls on his back and grabs the bottom of his cloak and rocks back and forth] I'm a banana! [Laughs] Don't slip on me!
Jake:  We're out of options. Let's just beat it out of him.
Finn:  No, Jake! We...
Ice King:  [Gets up] Wait a sec, there's a bug on you, friend. Smack! [Smacks Jake and in doing so hits Finn]
Finn:  Grrr... Biscuits, now's my chance!
Ice King:  [Shuffling through the board game, picks up a game piece] You know, I carved these game pieces from my own teeth.
Finn:  Boo hoo, boo hoo, boo hoo, boo hoo...
Ice King:  Huh? Crying?!
Finn:  Boo hoo. You hit me, Ice King. I don't think I could live any more knowing my best bosom hit me.
Ice King:  I was only saving you from poo poo palms!
Finn:  I'm dying because I know you care not for me. [Plays dead]
Ice King:  No! No, my...my bosom! What hath I done?! My friend! [Picks up Finn] My only friend.
Jake:  Hey, what about me?
Ice King:  Why?! Why?! WHY?!!!
Starchie:  Starchie's feeling healthy again! [Grow muscles] A bit too healthy if you ask me.
Princess Bubblegum:  They're all getting better! Finn and Jake did it! Ich bin so glucklich, ich koennte, ich koennte... ("I'm so happy, I could, I could...") [Almost flips over a cot but faints on it]
Ice King:  WHY?!!!... Ah, well. Gunter! Dispose of Finn's carcass.
Finn:  [Sad] Harumph.
Jake:  Good job! Those wails must have reached all the way to...
Finn:  Did you see how fast he dropped my lifeless body? That's just mean.
Jake:  Finn, if I came across your lifeless body, I'd clasp you dramatically for a kajillion years.
Finn:  Thanks, man.
Jake:  [Grows] Hey, why wait?! Play dead, Finn!
Jake:  Why?! Heh heh heh heh. Why?! Heh heh heh heh. Why?!
Finn & Jake:  Adventure time!
