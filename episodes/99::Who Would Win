Jake: What'cha think?
Finn: I can make that driz, no problem.
Jake: It's crazy far, man.
Finn: Naw, that's just a perspectal illusion. It looks far 'cause the cliff's lower.
Jake: Eh, go for it.
Finn: Whoo! Shoot!
Finn: Almost.
Jake: Not really.
Finn: What? Watch me, fool! [jumps again] Hup. WAAAAAAH!
Finn: I did it! Psych. [smacks lips] Hey, you know what? This is cool, just having bro time for once.
Jake: What, like, no ladies?
Finn: Or dudes, or whatevs. It's just a chore sometimes.
Jake: Yeah, two people is mad efficient.
Finn: Whoa.
Jake: It's a beach brawl!
Finn: Looks like they're trying to drown a barn.
Jake: That's not a barn. That's a dude!
Finn: Holy fizzle! [to a Marauder] What's goin' on here, tough boy? [sits on the Marauder's arm] What is that huge dude?
Marauder: He's the Farm, the legendary fighter of the Shiney Isles. I came here to participate in his open challenge, but this mother can't be beat!
The Farm: Give up, worms! My fight power is supreme! [punches water] I'm too freaking legendary for you! [drops Farm animals and punches a Marauder.]
Marauders:  [chanting] Train, Train, Train, Train!
Finn: Whoa!
Marauder #1: I love you, the Train!
Marauder #2: You're almost as legendary as the Farm, the Train!
The Train: The Train is gonna smack you down on his tracks! Whoop! [jumps down from cliff into lake] Your caboose is mine! [runs toward the Farm] Choo-choo. Choo-choo!
Finn: Oh, my Glob.
The Train: [now under the Farm] Choooo!
The Train: Ow. My legs are backwards! Oh! [the Train kicks him ashore] Oh, you're mean! [farts]
Finn: Did you just die?
The Train: No... the Train will chug on. My friend makes bionic legs. I'll be better than before.
Finn: [gasps] I want bionic legs! Who's your friend?
The Train: Yeah, right. It's secret! [begins dragging himself away] Ah! Don't follow me. [continues] Oh! The Train can do this. [continues moaning]
Jake: You don't want bionic legs. It ain't natchy.
Finn: I don't care about natchy.
Jake: Let's discuss this later.
The Train: You guys wanna fight me?
Finn: [to Jake] You think we can beat him?
Jake: Yeah way, we can't! He's the ultimate!
Finn: But if we beat him, we'll be crazy legends.
Jake: Man, I already am a legend in other aspects of life. Third highest score in Kompy's Kastle, bro. [holds up three fingers] Third... in the Candy Kingdom.
Finn: Jake, that's your legend. This could be our legend. Brogend!
Jake: Okay. How are we gonna beat him, then?
Finn: Train!
Jake: He can't even walk.
Finn: No, man, train up, like, get ripped!
Jake: Yeah, I was just kiddin'. Let's destroy that guy! [points to the Farm]
Finn: We're comin' back for you, the Farm! After we train!
The Farm: [coughs] Yeah, that's cool.
Finn: We're gonna annihilate you, the Farm!
The Farm: Mm'kay.
Finn: I'm gonna do a finishing move on you! Alright! Yeah! [laughs] [runs off] C'mon, Jake!
Jake: [follows Finn] Whoof. [coughs]
Finn: Hyah! Hyah!
Jake: Let's see your Chokey Brokey Style!
Jake: [strangled] Nice one.
Finn: Yes!
Jake: Now watch my... Something Style. [closes his eyes and punches Finn]
Finn: Huh?
Finn: Jake, you're playing Kompy's Kastle?
Jake: Huh? Whoo! Uh... yes.
Finn: Winning this battle could take our reputation to a whole new level!
Jake: Look, I'm a full-grown dog of my own, and I need to play Kompy's Kastle every day so I can maintain my rank.
Finn: So, you don't care about fighting the Farm?
Jake: I never really take anything seriously... 'cept Kompy's Kastle.
Finn: Hi-yah! [karate chops Jake's game out of his hands]
Jake: KOMPYYYYY!
Jake: I'm gonna break every bone in your body, then heal you later with that magical goo we got from the Cyclops' eye! [grows huge fists] AAAH! [smashes Finn]
Finn: Ouch.
Jake: [now giant-sized] [picks up Finn] Apologize!
Finn: [trying to escape Jake's grip] Never! [punches and grabs Jake's finger flesh]
Jake: I'm gonna turn up the juice!
Finn: [shaped Jake's flesh to look like Jake's face] And I'm gonna drink it! [punches the face]
Jake: [gasps] My little face!
Jake: Ouch! [punches his head where Finn is, but Finn climbs onto his nose] Ow. [punches his nose, but Finn jumps off] Oh! [starts spanking himself] Where are ya? Huh?
Finn: [laughs]
Jake: Huh? [sees Finn]
Finn: Apologize for not taking training seriously!
Jake: Come out, you chicken nug! [stretches into tree]
Finn: [turns around and punches Jake] Huh!
Jake: Ow.
Finn: [groans]
Jake: Apologize to Kompy's Kastle!
Finn: [weakly] No. You apologize for not taking training seriously.
Jake: Ehh, gross!
Finn: [laughs]
Jake: [groans]
Jake: Ow! [pushes Finn down and slaps his head]
Jake: AAH! My eyes! [wiping mud away] Cheap move, you butt rag!
Finn: You! You're the cheap move!
Finn: Huh? Pants! [kicks Jake away] Huh!
Jake: Oh!
Finn: I'm really gonna wipe you now.
Jake: [growing his buttocks] Bring it on, bro! [squishes Finn underneath his buttocks]
Finn: [chomps]
Jake: OUCH! Ow! O-o-o-ow! No bities! [stretches to normal size] Grrrrr! [barks]
Finn: [pulling up his pants while walking away] I'm gonna down the Farm without you.
Jake: I'm gonna knock down the Farm just so you'll never know the taste of downing the Farm!
Finn: Yo, guess what? Guess what, homey? I put in the time. I'ma make you mine.
Finn: Yeah, that's right. Come and get this.
The Farm: [yawns] [smacks lips] So, what? Both at the same time? I'm cool. You gonna fight this, the Farm? [laughs] Okay.
Finn: Just me. I don't need this [points to Jake] clown-town.
Jake: The only way you're gonna win is if you use your cheap moves.
Finn: [yawns, falls asleep, and starts snoring]
Jake: Hey. [touching Finn's hair] Come on! You gotta fight the dude!
Finn: Ah! I can't see! Walk me to the light!
Jake: Yeah, that's what you get.
Finn: [sleepily] Cloud looks like a car. [closes eyes]
Dream Warrior: Awaken to your dream, Finn and Jake.
Finn: Whoa. Who are you?
Dream Warrior: I am the Dream Warrior. I've summoned you to hang with me in your together dream.
Finn: Are you gonna show us a move to beat the Farm?
Dream Warrior: First, listen. Then, wake up.
Finn: Alright.
Dream Warrior: I have cheap cars. My cars are che-e-eap.
Finn & Jake: [trance-like, with closed eyes] My cars are cheap.
Dream Warrior: But they drive bad when I turn out the lights! [punches a headlight]
Finn & Jake: Turn out the lights.
Dream Warrior: [now wearing green pants] These sweatpants have another name.
Finn & Jake: Another name.
Finn: Yeah. Don't you always call sweatpants "give-up-on-life pants," Jake?
Jake: I do, because peeps need to respect themselves when they leave the house... even if it's just for ice cream, or TP, or whatev.
Dream Warrior: [holding two gold apples] Two shiny golden apples, ripe enough to bite.
Finn & Jake: Bite.
Dream Warrior: [bites the apples] That's all I gotta say for now. Get lost.
Jake: What is going on here, Dream Warrior?
Finn: Yeah, what's this all about?
Dream Warrior: [sprays a hose at them] Nap's over, sorry.
Finn: Ow!
Finn: Whoa. That... was a good nap.
Jake: Hey, did you dream about Dream Warrior?
Finn: Yeah. What was he trying to tell us, exactly?
Jake: I don't know; I didn't get it. But listen, man. I'm sorry I got mad at you. Who cares about my high score at Kompy? It ain't important.
Finn: No, man. It is important. Being the third best at something is math and deserves respect. Not like I did to Kompy. Anyway, I think we both got cranky after all that training.
Jake: Well, good thing we're rested, 'cause now we can beat this beast.
Finn: Yeah. Oh, hey! Look!
Jake: Dudes came back to watch us fight!
Finn: A'ight. This is it. Let's use what we learned in training.
Jake: Uh, all we did was fight dirty with cheapwait.
Dream Warrior [flashback]: My cars are che-eche-e-eap
Jake: Dream Warrior was telling us what cheap moves to use on the Farm! Headlights mean eyes!
Finn: Mud in the eyes!
Jake: Give-up-on-life pants!
Finn: [pants down] Pull down his pants like you did to moi!
Jake: Two golden apples!
Finn: Hm. I think I know what that means.
Jake: Well, sure. I can make a wild guess.
Finn: You ready, man?
Jake: Yeah, dude!
Jake: [whispering] Put your pants on.
Finn: [deep voice] Okay.
Marauders: [cheering]
