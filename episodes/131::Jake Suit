Finn:  Yup! Yeah, totally stuck that landing!
BMO:  Yeah! Woo woo!
Finn:  Man, it's been so long since I've worn the Jakesuit. I forgot how awesome your bod is, bro. Stretchy-arm power! [Finn uses Jake's stretchy arms to grape a can of grape soda. He drinks it and crushes the can on Jake's muzzle.] I feel unstoppable! [Finn jumps over and crushes a stack of wooden logs, leaving splinters in Jake] Bam! And I don't even feel it! [Jake cringes.] [Finn jumps over to BMO.] BMO, throw your plate at me!
BMO:  Okay! [BMO throws plate at Finn in the Jakesuit.]
Finn:  Yeah, BMO, show me the stuff, keep it coming! [BMO throws the rest of his tea at Jake's stomach.] Yeah, BMO, unleash the beast!
BMO:  Yah! Unleash the beast! [BMO starts kicking Jake's leg.]
Finn:  Come on, BMO, bring it, that's nothing! [BMO starts scratching Jake's leg.] [yells] You're weak, BMO!
Finn:  You OK, BMO?
BMO:  I am no match for the Jakesuit.
Finn:  That's right!
Finn:  Dog, the Jakesuit is mad strong! This junk could protect me from anything!
Jake:  [muffled] Uh, sorta. Wait, bro, what are you doing up here? You know I'm not actual armor, right?
Finn:  Septuple flip off the tree house! [Finn jumps off of Tree Fort.]
Jake:  Nooo!
Finn:  Ride 'em cowboy! Woo!
Jake:  You were a little rough with the Jakesuit today, bro. You mashed up my doggy bag pretty hard.
Finn:  Why didn't you stop me?
Jake:  When you're in my body, it pushes out my brain, so I have no control.
Finn:  C'mon bro, taking pain is easy. You just have to imagine that every bruise is a hickey from the Universe. And everyone wants to get with the Universe. [raises eyebrows up and down]
Jake:  I bet you wouldn't be saying that nonsense if I wore you as a suit.
Finn:  I bet I would be saying that nonsense.
Jake:  OK bro, let's see how you like it. I'll bring the pain!
Finn:  Do it bro, get in here!
Jake:  Haha yes! Time to bring the pain!
Jake:  Eh?
Finn:  [laughs] Man, are you kidding?
Jake:  You give up?
Finn:  You have to like, punch me in the face.
Jake:  Hmm. I thought I was. This is hard. I can't even make a fist. How do you control my body so well?
Finn:  Dude, I'm graceful. Mom raised me graceful.
Finn:  [laughs] Dude, what the Bjork?
Jake:  A-ha! Here we go! Dream Journal of a Boring Man, Volume 12.
Finn:  Uh, Jake, what are you doing?
Jake:  There's all kinds of pain, Finn.
Finn:  Dude, come on, don't do this.
Jake:  Ah. Okay, let's see. Ooh, this one looks good. And it's not too long, only seven pages! [laughs] Okay, here we go. [clears throat] [reading off page] "In my dream, I was eating jasmine rice. But it was also brown rice. And it was also my mother."
Jake:  Huh? Where am I? [looks around] Oh, yeah. Hey, Finn, how long have I been out?
Finn:  I don't know. A couple hours
Jake:  Say what?! Why are you still reading?
Finn:  It's actually not that bad. There's a bunch where he knows he's dreaming. Here, let me read you a little. [reading off page] "So I said to the first guy, if everyone in my dream is me, then you are me. And he said, I am who? And I said, me. And he said, who is me? And I said, you. [Jake sighs and flops down in exasperation.] And he said, what about you? And I said, no you!" [stops reading] It's like he's trying to solve a mystery that doesn't exist! You want me to keep going?
Jake:  No, I'm hungry.
Finn:  Yeah, I'm hungry too. How about a truce while you go make us some lunch?
Jake:  Oh, I didn't know we were allowed to call truces. I'll totally remember that the next time my doggy bag is hurtling towards a fence post.
Finn:  You know, you could use the opportunity of cooking me food to mess with me.
Jake:  [gasps] Wait a sec, you just gave me an idea!
Finn:  Yeah? [Jake laughs evilly.] Uh-oh. Oh, look out, you gonna make me something gross? Soemthing spicy? You know I can take it! [Jake blindfolds Finn while BMO is dancing to music in his headphones in the background.]
Jake:  Ta-da!
Finn:  Meatloaf? That's my favorite dish.
Jake:  Mmm-mmm.
Finn:  What did you do to it?
Jake:  I assure you, it's delicious.
Finn:  Okay, well, you're really terrible at this. [Finn grabs a bite of meatloaf and holds it up to his mouth. Jake snatches it up before he can eat it. BMO dances in the background.]
Jake:  Yummy!
Finn:  Oh, that's just mean.
Jake:  Admit you're wrong, and you can have some of this delicious meatloaf!
Finn:  Nah, I'm good.
Finn:  Jake, it's my special occasion phone! Someone's calling me to tell me about a special occasion.
Jake:  So?
Finn:  So can you walk me over there? I wanna see who it is! [Jake walks Finn over. Finn looks at the back of the phone.] Oh, it's Flame Princess. [laughs] I'll talk to her later. I don't want you embarrassing me or, uh, anything.
Finn:  Jake! Seriously, don't do this!
Jake:  Tell me I win, dude!
Finn:  No, absolutely not.
Jake:  Alright. Say goodbye to Flame Princess thinking you're cool! I'm gonna embarrass the Bjork outta you!
Flame Princess:  Oh, hey, you came! I got worried because you didn't answer special occasion phone. My relatives are waiting inside.
Finn:  What?
Flame Princess:  Well, that's why I called on special occasion phone. All my less-evil family members are here for dinner. Come eat!
Flame Princess:  Finn, this is my family. [Flame Princess gestures at table.] These are my two younger brothers, my brother who's home from the military, and my judgmental aunt and uncle. [Camera shows each family member as she described them.]
Finn:  [whispering to Jake] Jake, whatever you're about to do, please don't do it.
Older brother:  What are you doing in front of my family?!
Flame Princess:  Hold on, bro. Perhaps it is a non-flameish custom unknown to us.
Jake:  [as Finn] Nope! Just doin' the kind of stuff I do all the time!
Older brother:  This is a nightmare come true for me, sister.
Flame Princess:  What are you doing?!
Jake:  [as Finn] Don't you wanna see more?
Flame Princess:  Oh, my Bjork! No! I don't want to see more! Wait, what's that in your mouth? Jake?
Jake:  [in normal voice] Oops! Busted.
Flame Princess:  Are you controlling Finn?
Jake:  Yeah, I'm causing Finn pain. We have a bet going on.
Flame Princess:  And you made him dance like a baby, semi-nude, in front of my family? Wow, that's pretty hardcore.
Jake:  [chuckles] What?
Flame Princess:  Good luck, Finn. Hope you win!
Finn:  I will!
Jake:  Hmm!
Lady Rainicorn:  [in Korean] Finn! Oh, of all days! Where are you going? Jake, where are you?
Jake:  I'm right here.
Lady Rainicorn:  [in Korean] Oh!
T.V.:  'Sup?
Jake:  What's T.V. doing here? I thought all the kids found apartments.
Lady Rainicorn: [in Korean] No matter what, I think he's stay-at-home.
Jake:  Ha-ha! That's my boy. Momma's basement baby. [Jake makes Finn sit down.]
Lady Rainicorn:  [in Korean] Jake, what are you doing? Please tell me.
Jake:  Oh, it's this bet we're doing. It's not really a bet. It's more like a showdown. I'm trying to get him to admit that it's hard when someone wears you as a suit. How do I win the bet, Lady?
T.V.:  Hey, Dad? Why don't you try jumping in a volcano? [resumes typing]
Jake:  Yes!
Finn:  So, what are we doing, bro? [Finn shoes start to melt to the ground.]
Jake:  The Universe is going to have a full-on make-out session with you, bro. I'm talkin' minimum tier 8. Behold!
Finn:  Fire Wolves? That's your plan? Please.
Jake:  Oh no, bro, that's just fortuitous circumstance! [Jake makes Finn take some kibble out of his backpack.] Allow me to take advantage! here, pup pups! Want some kibble? Want steak flavor? Steaky-steaks?
Jake:  How you like it, bro? Pretty painful, huh?
Finn:  Eh, whatev.
Finn:  Hmm. Looks hot.
Jake:  Oh yeah, bro! The pain-train has arrived at the station! Choo-choo! [He wraps one leg around a rock on top of the volcano and lowers Finn down into the volcano.]
Finn:  I'm ready, bro! Bring it! You're nothin', lava! You're a bum! I can handle you!
Jake:  Look, just say stop, and you won't get burned.
Finn:  [yells] Never!
Jake:  Okay, bro. This'll pretty much wreck up your whole life, so think about it.
Finn:  Bring it! Yeah, baby, feels good, love it, lovin' that heat on my skull!
Jake:  Okay...I'm gonna lower you some more...probably gonna cook up your brain.
Finn:  Oh, yeah, give it to me!
Jake:  [thinking to himself] Dang, he's flippin' crazy! This isn't gonna do anything, he's never gonna give up!
Finn:  What happened? You robbed me of the win!
Jake:  You're right, man. My bruises are hickeys from the Universe. And I should just accept that.
Finn:  Yeah boy! In yo' face!
Jake:  Yeah, in my face.
Jake:  Dangit, Finn.
Big Clown Nurse:  Who's ready for rehabilitation?
Head Clown Nurse:  We'll start with full-body immersion therapy. [starts making kissing noises]
Finn:  [screaming] No!
Jake:  [quietly screaming to himself] Yes!
