Finn: SLAM!
Jake: [Jake makes his cat pretend to say:] Hey! I was trying to read that!
Finn: That book is above your level.
Jake: What business are you into?
Finn: None of your business!
Jake:  Talk about it over lunch?
Finn:  Heh, if you're buying.
Jake:  Hey!
Finn:  Hey!
Finn and Jake:  Fight!
LSP: Ahh! it's terrible!
Finn, Jake and Princess Bubblegum:  Lumpy Space Princess!
Princess Bubblegum:  Whats wrong?!
LSP:  You guys! Somebody stole something from me! Something I can't live without! [starts making noises and grunting]
Princess Bubblegum:  I'll get something to calm her down. [Princess Bubblegum walks away]
LSP:  I've been robbed! I've been robbed!
Princess Bubblegum:  [yells] Out of the way!
Princess Bubblegum:  [Princess Bubblegum tries to inject LSP with a green serum.] I need help! Can you guys hold her down?
LSP:  Do something! I've been- ooh! [LSP is injected with the serum. Her voice drops pitch and slows down] Ohh! [mumbles incoherently]
Princess Bubblegum:  Oops.
Finn:  LSP! Who robbed you?
LSP:  [in normal voice] It...was...puh...pee...pete...sa...sas...as...[mumbles incoherently and falls down to the ground]
Princess Bubblegum:  I think I gave her too much.
Finn:  Jake. A crime has been committed. We must find the criminal.
Jake:  We must.
Finn:  [looks up] And retrieve whatever it is that was stolen from Lumpy Space Princess.
Jake:  [looks up] Stolen. But all we have to go on is part of a name. Pete something. [Jake transforms into a magnifying glass] Need more clues! Hold me! [jumps into Finn's hand]
Finn:  Clues, clues, clues.
LSP:  [mumbles incoherently and holds up a golden key.]
Finn:  What's that? I can't see it.
Jake:  Oop, sorry. [opens mouth so there is a hole where the glass would be if he were really a magnifying glass] Aah!
Finn:  There's something in her hand! [picks it up] A key! A key to...what? Three zero three. Hmm.
Jake:  [closes his mouth so he can look at the key] Ooh, turn it around! [opens mouth again.]
Finn:  Ah! [the key says 'The Coolest Hotel' with a picture of said hotel.] Looks like we've got our first lead!
Finn:  Hmm. Find anything, Jake?
Jake:  [pulling out a plastic bag from inside another plastic bag] Got some bags and...wait- [pulls out another plastic bag] more bags. But no leads on Pete something.
Finn:  [shining flashlight on can.] Same here. BMO. [BMO pops out of Finn's backpack.] Start marking evidence.
Jake:  Hmm.
Finn:  Hmm.
BMO:  [drawing hand turkeys on the wall] Hmm.
Finn:  [Finn lifts a wooden log and finds a red substance.] Dude, check this! [Jake walks over.] Is this blood?
Jake:  Yeah man, that's definitely blood.
Finn:  Hmm. LSP's injuries were 100 percent emotional. So it has to belong to Pete Sa-something. BMO, take a sample and do a full blood analysis. [in a Jersey accent] The works. [in normal accent] Hey, if that guy cut himself during the robbery, he might have gone somewhere to buy a mini adhesive bandage. There's a drugstore across the street!
Jake:  [Jake jumps into Finn's hand.] Let's roll. [Jake morphs into a blob and consumes Finn within his body.]
Finn:  Woah!
Ann:  And if the oozing persists, just come back [leans over] [in a slightly hushed tone] and I'll give you something a little stronger.
Finn:  [Finn comes up from under the counter, pushing the customer out of the way.] I'm Finn. This is my partner, Jake. [Finn pulls up Jake who is in the form of a police badge.]
Jake:  Hello, citizen. Had anyone in here looking to buy some mini adhesive bandages today?
Ann:  A lot of people come through my store, gentlemen. You can't seriously think I'd be able to remember any one particular customer among the countless others I see on a daily basis, now, can you?
Finn:  I guess not. Fair dues. C'mon, Jake.
Ann:  [holding her finger up] Wait! Now that you mention it, there was this one guy in here earlier. Real suspicious type. Had a nosebleed. Said it was the first one he'd had in years. [As Ann is talking, Finn gets out a notepad and pencil.] Used to get them all the time as a kid, he said. [Jake slaps away the real notepad, and turns into a fake notepad for Finn to write on. He jumps into Finn's hands.] Can never remember if he was supposed to pinch his nose and hold his head back, or pinch his nose and hold his head forward. [As Finn tries to write on Jake, Jake blocks the pencil from writing on his body.] Maybe it was a case of being boxed on the nose too many times. [Finn finally pokes Jake, who stifles his laughter.] Made the blood vessels in his lower septum weak and vulnerable to hemorrhaging. Anyway, his mammy always said it was because he couldn't keep all those picky little fingers out of his dirty little nose holes. [As Ann is talking, Jake climbs on top of Finn's head and turns into a police hat.] He didn't buy it though. He always thought it had-
Finn:  Ma'am, can you give us a name?
Ann:  Mmm, nope. No wait, yes I can. Pete Sassafras.
Finn:  Did you catch which way he was going?
Ann:  Of course! He said he was catching a train at 11:27, Candy Kingdom Station, Platform 5. Heh. Sorry, I wish I could remember more.
Jake:  See anyone who might be our guy?
Finn:  [sighs] Nope. [Camera angle changes so we can see what Finn sees through the binoculars.] Nobody's suspicious here. Just a load of decent law-abiding folk. [Jake pushes binoculars away from Finn's eyes.] What the-?! Jake! What's with all the turning into stuff today?
Jake:  I really like turnin' into cop stuff. I literally can't stop turning into cop stuff. [Scene changes into Jake's perspective. Jake puts on binoculars and looks at Platform 5.] Hey, there's Platform 5! [He looks down and sees a guy in an overcoat, and hiding in his clothes. Jake gasps.] I see a nasty tranch!
Finn:  Let's book him, son.
Finn:  [at the man] Stop right there! What's under that skeezy trenchcoat ya-
Blueberry Cop 1:  [shouts] Crook! [Finn and Jake grunt loudly.] Busted! For attempting to board a train without a ticket.
Finn:  Oh, guys, he's getting away!
Jake:  We're not criminals, man! We're working the beat, just like you!
Blueberry Cop 1:  Jimmy?
Blueberry Cop 2 (Jimmy):  [licks Jake] Yup. Checks out. He tastes like police.
Blueberry Cop 1:  [sighs] Sorry about that, officers, it was an honest mistake.
Finn:  [looking at train] Ugh. We lost him.
Jake:  Not yet we didn't! [Scene turns to show Jake in a police car form, standing over Finn. He lowers himself and eats Finn, which transports Finn into the driver's seat of the car. Finn looks horrified as Jake makes siren sounds. Jake drives himself along the railroad.]
Finn:  Ugh! It's too far ahead! We'll never catch it.
Jake:  If we cut through the forest, maybe we can head it off at the pass.
Finn:  Sweet thinkin'.
Finn and Jake:  Yeah!
Finn:  Are you Pete Sassafras?
Pete Sassafras:  Wha-? Uh, I got a lot of names. Who's askin'?
Jake:  [Jake turns into a gun inside of Finn's hands. He makes a clicking sound like Finn cocked a gun.] Give back what you stole from LSP!
Pete Sassafras:  Who? What's that, an acronym or somethin'?
Finn:  Cuff 'em.
Jake:  Ehh, I got this. [Jake morphs into handcuffs and climbs up the man's hands, breathing heavily.] You have the right to remain...[breathes heavily] busted.
Pete Sassafras:  Alright, you listen, flatfoot. There's been some kind of crazy mistake here. I didn't do nothin'!
Jake:  Save it for the candy judge, Pete.
Finn:  Look, you can cut the act and drop the sass, Sassafras. We've got an eye-witness and your blood at the scene of the crime.
Jake:  You do the crime, you do the time, man!
Finn:  Roll the dice, you pay the price.
Pete Sassafras:  What dice? Oh, you guys are donkers.
Jake:  Burgle our friend, it's the end. [morphs his hand into a giant fist] For you!
Pete Sassafras:  I wanna see a lawyer.
Lawyer:  I'll handle this, Pete. You're upsetting my client. Just look at that face. That constitutes harassment, so give him some space. Don't worry buddy, I got this case.
"Lawyer":  [in a menacing voice] Welcome to the next twenty-five years of your life.
Finn:  [sighs] We deserve donuts.
Jake:  Let's ball. [Finn and Jake start to leave.]
Pete Sassafras:  No, wait, please! You guys!
"Lawyer":  Guilty! [The door closes.]
Finn:  Man, we didn't just crack that case, we crunched it! Crumbled it!
Jake:  We are awesome at being cops! [while eating a donut] No question about that.
Finn:  [sighs] Call me crazy, but I was thinking maybe we should actually become detectives. Like, as a job! When we were out on the streets back there, getting those leads, busting that perp, it just felt so...I don't know...right.
Jake:  [Jake forms a lump under Finn's coffee and puts his face on it. He eats Finn's donut.] I know, man. I actually totally do know exactly what you mean.
Finn:  [Finn looks inside his donut bag for another donut. He pulls out a yellow one that turns out to be Jake. He starts to bite it, and then takes it out of his mouth.] Aw, dude. [Finn is shown sitting on the street with Jake in his hands.]
Jake:  I told you: I have a problem. I can't stop!
BMO:  [BMO walks by Finn sitting on the street.] Howdy, partner.
Finn:  Oh hey, BMO. What's going on?
BMO:  I finished processing the blood sample. And I have the result.
Finn:  Nice!
Jake:  Yeah, good work, BMO!
Finn:  It's Pete Sassafras's blood, right?
BMO:  No. It doesn't belong to anyone because it's not blood. It's tomato sauce.
Jake:  Tomato sauce?
Finn:  Hmm... [As Finn is thinking, Jake turns into a smoking pipe and climbs up Finn. He puts himself in Finn's mouth like Finn is smoking, reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes. A translucent LSP flies across the screen saying "Pete...sass" over and over.] Oh my mind! LSP wasn't trying to say "Pete Sa-something", She was trying to say "Pizza something!"
Jake:  But how would pizza sauce end up in a hotel room?
Finn:  [snaps his fingers] Unless it was delivered.
Finn and Jake:  Pizza Sassy's!
Finn:  Where's the delivery guy?!
Man behind the counter:  Oh, you mean Petey. He's out. He's makin' deliveries.
Jake:  [whispering to Finn] Or maybe he's out tying up loose ends!
Finn:  [gasps and screams] LSP could be in danger!
Jake:  Danger! [Finn and Jake walk back to the counter.]
Finn:  Phone?
Man behind the counter:  Phone. [He smiles and points to a phone in the store.]
Finn:  [Gasping, Finn grabs the phone. He makes sounds like he is typing in a number. He somehow makes a call to Princess Bubblegum without pressing anything.] Princess! Have some Banana Guards outside of LSP's hospital room!
Princess Bubblegum:  Huh? Why?
Finn:  LSP could be in danger!
Princess Bubblegum:  LSP woke up and went back to her hotel room.
Finn:  [screaming] OH MY JAM!!!
Finn and Jake:  He's already here! [They both run towards the hotel, screaming and gasping.]
Woman behind counter:  Can I help you?
Finn and Jake:  [screaming] LSP! [They run, screaming down the hallway to room 303, where they here LSP yelling "Oh no!" and "What are you doing?!" Jake breaks down the door and both Finn and Jake look in. They see LSP laying on top of the pizza delivery guy.]
LSP:  It was you! You did it!
Petey:  Help me! I was just delivering the pizzas she ordered. And now she won't let me leave.
Finn:  LSP, what is going on? You said he stole something from you.
LSP:  He did! He stole...my heart! [LSP starts sobbing]
Finn:  Hurry up, dude!
Jake:  Shh!
Finn:  Right.
Petey:  Thanks!
Finn:  Shh. Go, go!
Petey:  [while walking out] Yeah, no tip, huh? That's great. That's how it is, around here. Fine.
Jake:  [morphing into police car] Huh, huh? Come on pal. Turns out the only case here is just another case of LSP being nutty!
