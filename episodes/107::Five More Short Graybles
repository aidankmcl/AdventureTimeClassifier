Cuber:  Hmm? Oh! Hello there! Bayble navel! Its great to see you! Here for more graybles, I reckon. Well, alright. Just like last time. [Like in Star Trek, the window doubles as a digital screen] Well watch five separate stories, each relating to one special theme. [The visualizer is divided into 5 sections like a food pyramid. Each section with a picture representing each chronological grayble] Guess the theme by the end of the episode and youll be the freshest mint-whistle! [laughs] Now, look to my visualizer screen and let this exciting grayble dribble all over your mind-label! [laughs] [Fade into first grayble]
Jake:  [Jake pushes aside the chicken and it flies away] Okay, so- scooch! Okay so Im still pretty sure this old book is some warlock spell book or something .
Finn:  [Jake blows off the dust to reveal a nursery rhyme book] Messed.
Jake:  Warlocks, dude! [Jake sits down and opens the book] You ready for some ancient feel good spell craft?
Finn:  Yeah, Ill try it. Could always stand to feel better.
Jake:  [Jake reads over the page, which is Little Jack Horner] Leeeeets seeeee. You got your bibby?
Finn:  [Finn has a bib] Check it! [Jake stretches some of his skin to make a bib]
Jake:  [Jake uncovers the pie] Yup! [Finn and Jake hold up their thumbs and the background goes black. Jake begins reciting the rhyme as though it were a spell]
Jake:  [They look around for something to happen] I dont feel like a good boy.
Finn:  You sure you read that spell right?
Jake:  [Jake is eating his plum] Yeah. Still though. Pretty sweet.
Finn:  Wanna keep stickin our thumbs in stuff til it works?
Jake:  Yeah! [They high five with plums on their thumbs]
Jake:  [They burst out the barns doors] Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [Sticks his thumb in an ant hill]
Finn:  Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [Sticks his thumb in a birds nest]
Jake:  Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [He pokes Ladys baby bump with his thumb and Lady kisses him]
Finn:  Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [Sticks his thumb into a tree. Finn seems somewhat agitated now]
Jake:  Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [Sticks his thumb into a flower]
Finn:  Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [Sticks his thumb in a bottle]
Jake:  Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [Finn is holding a chipmunk arms up and Jake sticks his thumb in its armpits]
Finn:  [Finn has his thumb in a mushroom and when he puts his thumb down, it breaks] Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-a Do you feel like a good boy? [Finn and Jake are sitting on rocks by a pond]
Jake:  No, I dont.
Finn:  Hey check out that gross toad! [There is a toad with holes in its back with baby toads hoping in and out of them]
Finn and Jake:  [They walk over to it and start poking the holes with their thumbs] Oh-what-a-good-boy-am-I. Good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy.
Toad:  [Finn and Jake talk over him] Gross! Ahahah! Cut it out! Quit stickin your thumbs in my back! Ahhhh! [Marceline is hovering several feet above them, watching.]
Marceline:  Yeeeaaah, I dont know. [She pulls out her map and flies forward] Uhhhhh, jeez! Im never gonna find this place! Hmmm. [There is a rock giant playing drums up ahead, but instead of drum sticks, he uses his massive fingers. Marceline flies towards him] Hey! [He ignores her and continues playing] Hey! Hey rock giant! [He stops to listen] You seem cool! Do you know where wizard Bills music shop is? I cant find it anywhere! Hes got a guitar that plays the most savory licks in Ooo! [He points into the clouds and his finger is seen moving extremely quickly past several landmarks]
Wizard Bill:  [The giants finger bursts through Wizard Bills shop door and Bill is startled] Whaglgalgaw!
Marceline:  [The giant pulls back his finger, but Marceline couldnt see through the cloud cover.] Huuuuh. Ive got an idea. [Marceline sits on his finger] Okaaay, point now. [She is blowing in the wind and yelling cheerfully] Wahahahoh yeah! Woowhohaha! [She gets off and fist bumps him] Thanks man! [She enters the shop and Wizard Bill hands her the guitar and she plays it]
Jake:  [Finn and Jake are poking some marshmallow kids] Lets find some more holes.
Tree Trunks:  [Tree trunks has a pie on her back as she meanders along] La da da la da da mmm deedle dee...
Finn and Jake:  [Finn and Jake poke the pie] What-a-good-boy-am-I!
Tree Trunks:  Oh! He he! Boys. Your manners. [Tree trunks bumps into a statue and her pie falls] Oh! Whoops! Oh!
Shelby:  Hey, Tree Trunks!
Tree Trunks:  Excuse me sir. I wasnt looking where I was-
Shelby:  Tree Trunks! Up here!
Tree Trunks:  [Tree Trunks looks up at the fist in the air] Oh no! Heavens no!
Banana Guard:  [Tree Trunks is with a Banana Guard at the police station] Im glad you brought this matter to the authorities mam. Now what exactly happened?
Tree Trunks:  [She is wiping away tears] Yes thank you. I-I heard a man calling out to me Oh Tree Trunks! So I said whos calling? I dont know. So I looked and he was making a RUDE gesture. [Sounding as angry as a pie-making old lady can] It left a sour taste in my mouth!
Banana Guard:  Alright, ma'am. [He pulls out a pen and paper] Lets see. How do you spell your name?
Tree Trunks:  T...
Banana Guard:  Okay.
Tree Trunks:  R...
Banana Guard:  Okay.
Tree Trunks:  E...
Banana Guard:  Okay.
Tree Trunks:  E...
Banana Guard:  One sec.
Tree Trunks:  E! [She is mad]
Banana Guard:  Hold on oone second.
Tree Trunks:  Uggh! Im sorry, but the wheels of justice spin too slowly! [She storms out of the door] Im going to have to take the law into my own hands!
Tree Trunks:  Thank you all for coming! The police have failed me in my time of need! So Ive brought you here together. A posse! [She hands the Gumdrop Lasses pantyhose filled newspaper] I made you all blackjacks [Police batons] in case things get...uuugly. I stuffed some of my stockings with balled up newspapers. I made a big one for you, because youre so strong. [She hands one to Cinnamon Bun] Alright then! [They are swinging their blackjacks patrolling the street] Lets clean up these streets! [She falls on her side and kicks her little elephant legs as helplessly as possible] Oh there he is! Oh my goodness!
Gumdrop Lasses:  [They run past Tree Trunks and start hitting the Cranky Cookie statue] Weeeee! [grunting]
Tree Trunks:  [The banana guard comes up] Oh. Why. Its just a statue. I-I-I dont understand. I-It was so rude before. [Cinnamon Bun is in the background wearing his blackjack]
Shelby:  Hey Tree Trunks! [Shelby is on top of the statues fist]
Tree Trunks:  Oooh!
Shelby:  Hey! Tree Trunks! How are you!
Banana Guard:  Sheeelbyy! Have you been up there all day?
Shelby:  Yeeeeesss. Just readin this book. [Holds up book]
Banana Guard:  Uhh, well can ya read somewhere else? Ya kinda offended Tree Trunks here.
Shelby:  [Looks around and finally understands] What? I-uh. Uh. Oh. Oooh! [laughs] I get it! [laughs]
Tree Trunks:  [laughs] Wonderful! [Shelby crawls away and Ice King is seen flying in the background]
Ice King:  [The Ice King flies into his window and calls together his penguins] Family meeting! Family meeting gather round. [He squats down and the penguins look up at him] Things are gonna change around here very soon! Youre gonna have a new mommy to help BOSS ya around! Well, I mean- I havent exactly asked her yet. Welp! No time like the present! [He pulls up the helm of his tunic to reveal his foot and he hums while doing so] Ya deh deh duh duh duh deh. Sweetie, are you awake? [There is a poorly drawn female face on his foot] Great! Because I have a query Ive been meaning to inquire of you. [He is flustered] Well, uh. [giggles] When two people, eh- will- Will you marry me! [He looks at his foot] Oh yah! [He begins crying and the penguins start licking up his tears] Yes! Yes drink up the tears! Drink up those good luck tears! [Gunter approaches, but Ice King smacks him away] No, not you Gunter! Youre on a low-salt diet! Huh? [He looks down at his foot] Uh-a-whats that dear? Oh! I almost forgot! [He makes a fanfare tune] Do do-do do-Do! [He pulls out a ring and puts it on his toe] Its a wife ring! [He pulls out another ring and place it on his own finger] This ones for me. Im the husband. That means I get the remote control THREE days a week and you get it four! [laughs excitedly] [He has his foot pulled up to eye level and turned around as if it were sitting next to him on the balcony] Ahhh, Sweetie, this is bliss. It feels so math to finally be normal. Not like those two freaks. [He points to Finn and Jake sticking their thumbs in a snowman] What are they doin over there? Anyway! I-oh, whos that? [He looks at his other foot and there is a winking face on it] Oh. Oh my. [He looks nervous]
BMO:  [Now we are at the Tree Fort] Poor Football, youve come so far, but still have so much to learn.
Football:  [BMO is talking to his reflection in the window] But I dont understand BMO. Im a real baby girl now. I can smell the reddest lilacs. I can hear the screaming squirrels! Screaming for nuts! Oh my gosh! I cant believe its true!
BMO:  No, Football. Thats not enough. You have to learn manners too. Otherwise, youll be all alone!
Football:  Alone? But-but what about you BMO?
BMO:  I will not always be here to protect you Football. No, you must learn. Here look! [Pulls out grapefruit spoon] This is a grapefruit spoon. It is only for eating grapefruit. [Pulls out a salt shaker and shakes salt into the air] This is a salt shaker. Here, you try. [BMO and his reflection are both shaking the salt up into the air and laughing] [BMO pulls out a strange contraption] Now this is a turnip grincher. [Football looks at it quizzically] For grinching. Aaand, this is how you drink tea. [BMO sticks out his pinky and sips the tea] Ahhh. [The tea pours over his face]
Football:  Like this? [Does not have pinky out] Yuck! [giggles] Its bitter!
BMO:  No, no. Football like this. [BMO shows Football again]
Football:  Like this?
BMO:  No, like this. [BMO is getting frustrated]
Football:  Like this? [Both BMO and Football begin sparking from the liquids]
BMO:  Like this! [BMO is angry]
Football:  Like this, right?
BMO:  No Football. Do it like- huh? [BMO sees Finn and Jake outside through the window] Sorry Football. Lessons are over for tonight!
BMO:  [Finn sighs. Finn and Jake walk up the ladder to find BMO, all charred, sitting on the couch] Why so glum fellas?
Finn:  [Sounding depressed] We stuck or thumbs in almost every hole today.
Jake:  But we never felt like good boys.
BMO:  I know a thing or two about good boys. Why dont you try sticking your thumbs in these holes? [BMO is holding his fingers to form a hole over the controllers start buttons]
Finn:  [He looks at BMOs fingers] Controllers? [He looks up to find a video game start screen called Super Good Boys] Haha! Oh yeah! Super Good Boys!
Finn and Jake:  [They use their thumbs to push the buttons through BMOs fingers] Bawmp! [The characters in the game start picking up trash and cleaning the digital house while BMO giggles]
Cuber:  So, did you guess the theme? Go ahead and pause your viewer now if you need a few more glayble to think about it a little. [A pause viewer now card appears for a second] Oho! Now youve got it! I can tell! Thats right, the theme is the five tastes. [For each example, a still from the corresponding grayble appears] You see, Jake ate a SWEET plum. Marceline played some SAVORY licks. Tree Trunks had a SOUR taste inside her mouth. Oh my. Gunter wanted to drink the SALTY tears. And Football's tea was BITTER. [He laughs until he supposedly hears something] Huh? Whats that you say? You thought the theme was the five fingers? [he laughs] Dont be silly! No ones had five fingers for twenty blablillion glaybles. Five telepathy glands maybe. [he calms down] Ah... slimmin. Well anyway, looks like its that time again. [waves goodbye] Ill see you crimpy glimmers on triode flimpin the diode! [he laughs as the screen cuts]
