Magic Man: Bzzz, bzzz, bzzz, bzzz. The waffle doll shall fall lest you eat the yellow dough. [injects Jake with syringe] Bzzzzz... [flies away]
Jake: [stops humming] Hmm. [rubs eyes] I'll... I'll finish this later. [yawns and lies down] So tired. And also hungry... [rubs belly] Maybe I should... eat some [starts snoring]
Jake: Huh? Uh... [touches yellow grass] Huh. Hmm. Everything's made of... me.
Jake: Pretty neat. I bet there's, likelike a cool city or something around here.
Jake: Nice. Jake City. [walks into city]
Jake Person: Hi!
Jake: Oh, uh, hi!
Jake Person: Jake! How you doing, Jake?
Jake: [waving] Uh, good, man! Good!
Jake: Man, this place is awesome! [approaches a storefront] Ooh! [looks through glass] Cool dolls! They look like the rare antique kind. Maybe my kids will like them. Mm. Wonder what my kids are gonna have for dinner. Maybe pizza...
Jake: Whoa-oh! Some kind of Jake-quake...
Goose: Eh? Is that Jake?
Jake: [turns around] Hey there, um...
Goose: C'mon, man! It's Goose! Your best friend, Goose!
Jake: Oh, uh, of course! Goose!
Goose: Aww, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, ya big goof! How long's it been? Two, three years?
Jake: Let's see, uh... [counts on fingers] one, two, uh... I've never been here.
Goose: [laughs] "I've never been here." You've still got it, Jake.
Jake: [fake-laughs]
Goose: C'mon! Let's get you home. Everyone's waiting for you at the party.
Jake: Ehparty?
Goose: No. Par-tay!
Jake: [laughs] Do it again, Goose!
Jake: [laughs]
Goose: Hey, Jake.
Jake: Hey, what?
Goose: Now that you're back, how 'bout that five bucks you still owe me?
Jake: Uh, what five bucks?
Goose: Cheeseburger cheesecake ring a bell?
Jake: What? What is that?
Goose: Oh, oh, that. Don't worry about that. Do notdon't worry about that.
Jake: [thinking] Guess I'd better not worry about it. [aloud] Hmm. I'm hungies, Goose.
Goose: I think there's a leftover nacho basket or something in the fridge.
Goose: [leaving] Just a sec. [gets food from the fridge and returns] Cold cut-and-nacho sandwiches!
Jake: All right! [takes a bite] Ow! Something's wrong, Goose. Jakey can't eat any of these nachos... [ground rumbles] but Jakey needs nachos! Aah!
Urchin: Mr. Jake! Mr. Jake! Mr. Jake, the Mayor wants to see you straightaway.
Jake: Alright, lad, show me the way! [follows Urchin]
Finn: Jake! Hey, I got a for-real important question: do you like cereal in your cake? Jake? [pats him] Hmm... [shrugs and smiles] Mm-mm-mm.
Urchin: Mr. Mayor.
Mayor: Urchin, thank you for your help. Help yourself to the herring cakes.
Urchin: Right-o!
Mayor: [shaking Jake's hand] Hello, Jake. Thanks for making it.
Jake: Heh. Okay.
Mayor: Now look, we're at orange alert here. Below us are gathered the city's top minds.
Jake: Hmm.
Mayor: And they've noticed that our seismographic troubles have increased exponentially since your arrival.
Jake: Mayor, uh, I want to meet these minds.
Mayor: Here are some of the minds.
Scientist: Jake, we want to perform some tests on you to discover the cause of the quakes.
Jake: There's no need. I've got it figured out. The tremors are happening because Jake is hungry, [pats belly] and his stomach is growling. And the hungrier he gets, the worse the quakes will become.
Jake: I'll prove it!
Scientists: Huh?
Jake: Mention a food item.
Scientist: Omelet.
Jake: What's in the omelet?
Scientist: Chili! It's a four-egg chili omelet!
Scientist: Watch out!
Scientist: Analysis, Tim!
Tim: It's too early to say; this evidence is anecdotal!
Jake: Look, just let me stretch outside to get something to eat, and the quakes will stop.
Tim: That doesn't sound very science-y.
Scientist: No, but you have my permission to test your idea.
Dr. Erik Adamkinson: I don't like that idea.
Scientists: Huh?
Dr. Erik Adamkinson: If Jake leaves, that would mean the utter destruction of our world. I believe that Jake is an extra-dimensional being, a Glob if you will, whose psychic field holds our world together. If he leaves, his flesh will reconfigure, and everything and everyone here will disappear completely!
Tim: Oh, Dr. Erik Adamkinson, you're just a fringe scientist, well known to have a crackpot of crazy theories.
Dr. Erik Adamkinson: Hm! Perhaps I am. And maybe I am wrong... but are you really willing to take that chance? We should imprison Jake immediately!
Jake: What?! No way! The world's not gonna end just because I go get a bagel.
Mayor: Seize him!
Jake: Uh, peace! [grows in size]
Jake: Why?!
Mayor: Finish him.
Jake: [sadly] Mm. [longingly] Bagel.
Dr. Erik Adamkinson: Don't worry, everybody. I will journey to Jake's Glob world, which, legend would have us believe, lies beyond the great sky-hole, and bring back the food of the globs to appease Jake's appetite, thus saving everybody.
Dr. Erik Adamkinson's father: Wait! Wait! [hugs Dr. Erik Adamkinson] I want to go with you, Son!
Dr. Erik Adamkinson: I-I'm sorry, Dad. Y-you can't; i-it's too dangerous. Your mind is unprepared.
Dr. Erik Adamkinson's father: My son. [weeps]
Dr. Erik Adamkinson: Huh? [grabs balloon] Yeah!
Dr. Erik Adamkinson: There it is, the sky ho-o-o-o-ole!
Dr. Erik Adamkinson: Phew! Oh, my stars! It's just as I envisioned! Almighty Jake Globs, I beseech your aid! Do you have bagels? Hello? Hmm. Maybe those aren't the true globs. Yeah, they're too ugly to be [gasps]
Dr. Erik Adamkinson: [screams and then weeps] I thought you'd be beautiful. But you're not! [cries] You're hideous! Hideous! [melts into Jake's body]
Finn: [points to projector] BMO, resume.
Jake: Spaghetti... [stomach rumbles]
Guard: Don't!
Guards: Huh?
Guard: Hey, you're a le
Jake: [sighs] Huh?
Jake: Goose?
Goose: Go.
Jake: Butbut what if Erik Adamkinson is right? What if you and all the Jake peeps disappear and I can't bring you back?
Goose: Then you won't have to pay me back that five bucks.
Jake: But
Goose: Go eat, Jake!
Finn: Uh, Jake? What's going on, man? Feeling okay?
Jake: [eating beans] Just getting a snack, Goose. [sheds a tear] Just getting a snack.
