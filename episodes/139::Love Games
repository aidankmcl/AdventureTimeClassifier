Jake: If I hear another peep, there's gonna be trouble! Final warning. Okay, go ahead, BMO.
Jake: Okay, welcome back to the program. We're talkin' with our special guest, Finn the Human.
Finn: Hello.
Jake: Now, Finn, before the break, you were sayin' somethin' interestingthat you're gettin' outta the romance biz. So, what happened?
Finn: Well, I don't want to bore your listeners...
Finn: But let's just say the time has come to stop dating princesses... and return to savin' 'em.
Jake: And you're not just sayin' that to, uh[someone knocks on the door several times] [Jake talks over it] make yourself seem more attractive?
Finn: Yeah, of course. No games goin' on here.
Jake: Hold on, hold on. [takes off headphones] What's that noise?
BMO: I think someone's knocking at the door.
Jake: Can you see who it is?
BMO: Yes, Jake.
Jake: So, it's goin' pretty good, huh?
Finn: Yeah, but maybe we should stop talking about this "love" junk and get back to adventuring.
Slime Princess: Finn! Jake! I need your help; it's an emergency! [cries]
Finn: Now we're talkin'! Don't cry, Slime Princess. We're at your service.
Slime Princess: I need Finn to marry me.
Finn: I'm sorry, SP, but I've given up the dating scene.
Slime Princess: You don't understand. If I don't get a husband, I'll lose my kingdom.
Ice King: [pulls back shower curtain] I'll do it!
Jake: What did I tell you?!
Slime Princess: Please let me explain.
Slime Princess: Recently, my much hotter younger sister, Blargetha, married a Slime rogue named Guillermo. As a result, Elder Plops decreed that if I was not married by tomorrow, rule of the Slime Kingdom would pass to my sister...
Slime Princess: ...which I'd be, like, totally fine with...
Slime Princess: Except, I recently discovered they are both evil. Evil to the core! They plan to militarize the kingdom and begin a campaign of aggressive conquest, [Tanks roll over the Hot Dog Kingdom.] sacking our neighboring kingdoms, [Slime People fill a sack with treasure.] stealing their resources, [Blargetha stands atop a Gumball Guardian] and eventually taking over the entire world! [The Gumball Guardians spray slime all over the Candy Kingdom.]
Jake: Ew.
Slime Princess: Finn, this will happen unless someone marries me.
Finn: No.
Ice King: [pulling back curtain slightly] Psst! [points to himself]
Jake: Hmm!
Slime Princess: Please, Finn. I know I've crushed on you in the past, but I have no intention of locking this down. Our marriage will be in name only.
Finn: Hmmm...
Jake: [running after them] Wait, I'm coming, too! I'm gonna eat popcorn and make hilarious jokes. [empties the last kernel from his bag into his hand] Aw, who ate all my popcorn?
Ice King: [eating popcorn] You call this a room? There's not even a window. Oh, wait. Are we rolling?
Jake: [munching popcorn] How much farther? This popcorn's not gonna last all day. [shrinks] Alright, now it might.
Slime Princess: We're here. [They have arrived at a bubbling cesspool of slime.] Welcome to my little oasis in the wasteland.
Jake: Oasis? More like, "No way, sis!" [laughs]
Finn: Huh?
Jake: [gasps] [climbs into Finn's mouth]
Finn: Whoa! This is amazing! You okay, buddy?
Jake: You could say I got out of there [Finn lifts him out of his mouth with his tongue] in the "lick" of time. Zing!
Slime Princess: Quickly. We're already late. [leads them to a colorful building with dance music playing inside] This is the most important place in the kingdom.
Finn: The royal palace?
Slime Princess: No, it's where me and all my main splurts hang out. Hi, girls!
Slime People: Hi!
Finn: Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig, what are you doing here?
Tree Trunks: Oh, we always come here when we want to shake it, Finn. It's the only triple cray-rated disco in all of Ooo.
Slime Princess: Get your face pretty, Finn. My people are already assembled in the courtyard. [walks onto balcony above a crowd of Slime People] [clears throat] Greetings, loyal slimejects!
Slime People: [cheer]
Slime Princess: I would like to introduce my new husband, [Finn enters] Finn the Human!
Slime People: [cheer]
Slime Princess: [to Finn] What did I tell you? Piece of cake.
Blargetha: Attention, my loyal slimejects!
Slime Princess: [gasps] It's Blargetha. [A mustached Slime Person in a hat pops up beside her.] And that's the mysterious Guillermo. He hails from a faraway, much more somber Slime Kingdom where people have strange customs and no love in their eyes. Their discos aren't even rated one cray.
Blargetha: My husband would like to say something. And, uh, he would, too, if not for his extremely sore throat. So I will say it for him. We challenge you to the Trials of Glarb.
Slime People: [gasp]
Slime Princess: I object! Ancient traditions such as the Trials of Glarb are no longer relevant in our modern self-indulgent society.
Elder Plops: [entering on a third balcony] Order, order! I demand order. I, Elder Plops, being the coolest guy in the room, will settle this dispute. The matter will be settled on the battleground...
Finn: Alright!
Elder Plops: ...the battleground of love.
Finn: Aw.
Elder Plops: The couple that I deem most truly in love shall rule the Slime Kingdom for life. [taps scepter] Plops out. [exits balcony]
Finn: [sighs]
Jake: This is, like, the opposite of what you wanted.
Elder Plops: Welcome to the Trials of Glarb, hosted by me, Elder Plops. The first trial will be Crooning. You guys are gonna get into these sweet boats I made and croon for each other on the lake. The most loving and heartfelt song, judged by me, Elder Plops, will win.
Elder Plops: I really want to hear some emotional song work here. The people want to hear emotional stuff. So let's see some stuff, alright? [claps thrice]
Slime Princess: Okay, Finn, you can do it.
Finn: I don't know. I'm still jacked up over my lady biz.
Slime Princess: Well, just lose yourself in your own mind and go numb. Then let it all out.
Finn: Eh. [exhales deeply] Okay. Just let it all out. [sings "I Just Can't Get Over You"] Why can't I get over you?
Elder Plops: Finn, way to go. I could tell the people were really impressed. Guillermo, you're up.
Blargetha: Hmm? Okay, Guillermo. I'll ask, I'll ask. Uh, Guillermo still has a sore throat! Uh, may I sing on, uh, his behalf?
Elder Plops: Elder Plops thinks that's okay.
Blargetha: [clears throat] [sings tunelessly] I want to touch your hand with my hand. I want to rub your cheek with my cheek. Maybe later we can get "Do not disturb." I'm done!
Elder Plops: As Elder Plops, I have heard many songs in my life, and I can only say this... Finn, you win this one.
Slime People: Hooray!
Blargetha: [growls]
Finn: Whoo!
Slime Princess: Yes!
Elder Plops: Welcome, everyone, to our second trial... [The sheets are removed, revealing mattresses.] Spooning. When I say go, the big spoon will put his arm around the little spoon and cuddle. I will be watching you spoon, measuring and assessing your love by posture and overall vibe. The best cuddle, or spoon, wins.
Finn: Wait, what?!
Jake: [laughs]
Elder Plops: Spooners, get in your futons.
Finn: Uh, I don't feel good about this.
Elder Plops: Ready, set...
Elder Plops: Spoon!
Finn: [gasps] No, wait. I don't wanna do this.
Slime Princess: Wrap those gorgeous pythons around me!
Finn: No! This feels weird!
Slime Princess: Come on, Finn, they're crushing us!
Blargetha: [moving around on the mattress with Guillermo] Huh! Huh! Huh!
Elder Plops: Blargetha and Guillermo, very nice.
Finn: Nooooooooooooooooo!
Elder Plops: Yeesh. Alright, everyone, stop. I've seen enough. Blargetha and Guillermo's love was way-off-the-charts good. They win.
Blargetha: Yes! I love you, baby. You spoon so good!
Finn: [pants]
Slime Princess: No!
Elder Plops: The score is tied. There's one more trial after Spooning and Crooning: Smooching. I'm sorry it doesn't rhyme with Crooning and Spooning. We will begin our next trial on the morrow!
Slime Princess: [sighs] This is not going well.
Finn: I'm sorry, Slime Princess. I'm just gonna mess this next trial up.
Slime Princess: Is it because you haven't done much kissing? You don't have to be embarrassed by your innocence.
Finn: Pretending to be in love is making me sad. It makes me think about Flame Princess.
Slime Princess: What If I pretend to be your ex?
Finn: That's worse, I think.
Slime Princess: Well, it looks like I'm losing my kingdom to the forces of evil.
Finn: [sighs] No, Slime Princess. Let's practice this smooch. [picks up Slime Princess]
Slime Princess: [puckering] Mmmm.
Finn: [groans and gags] [vomits] I'm sorry. II can't! [sets Slime Princess down] [groans] Bunk this.
Slime Princess: Wait! Where are you going?
Finn: I'm going to punch Guillermo in his stupid face until he agrees to leave the kingdom.
Slime Princess: I want to come!
Finn: Hey, Guillermo! Can you come out here for a... quick meeting?
Jake: More like a quick beating! Hey-oh!
Blargetha: He says "Eat a fat dollop and buzz off!"
Slime Princess: Blargetha!
Finn: [jumps into room] Hyup! [looks around] Hmm. [gasps]
Blargetha: Finn, you shouldn't break in to a woman's room.
Finn: Hyah! Everyone okay?
Jake: Yes. "Tank" you.
Finn: Huah! [climbs in, finding Blargetha and Guillermo]
Blargetha: Huh?
Finn: Guillermo! [punches him, apparently killing him] Hyuh! [gasps] Are you dead, man? Aw, jeez, bro. [picks up one of his "eyes"] Huh? These are olives.
Blargetha: Uh-oh.
Slime Princess: Blargetha, why would you make a fake husband? You're so hot.
Blargetha: You don't know how hard it is to be this hot. Women don't want to talk to you, because they're intimidated, and guys don't want to talk to you, because they're too scared. You're alone in the hottest, most sexiest prison. So I stuck some olives in a glob of gelatin and called it my lover.
Finn: Well, I'm sorry, Blargetha, but you're going to have to spend more time in your metaphorical prison in a real prison 'cause what you're doing is illegal.
Slime Princess: Uh, no, it just disqualifies her from challenging me.
Finn: Whoops.
Slime People: [cheer]
Elder Plops: By the authority of Elder Plops, [lifts Slime Princess' crown] I officially declare... [puts crown back] you are still the Slime princess.
Slime People: [chanting] Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Slime Princess: Finn, what do you think?
Finn: I don't want to disappoint all these people.
Slime Princess: I'm sorry! I can't do it! [continues vomiting]
