Morty Rogers: [ Sighs ]
Bmo: Dinner?... [Runs to Finn and Jake] Please can we invite him to dinner?!
Jake: No.
Bmo:  But, Jake, I never ask you for anything. When did I ever ask you for anything?
Jake: Yesterday. You said, "Jake, please take me to see chips and Ice cream! It's a Broadway smash!" And I believed you.
Bmo:  [ Crying ] You don't understand me, Jake.
Morty Rogers: [ Sighs ]
Bmo: Please come over for dinner! I love you! [ Squeals ]
Morty Rogers: Yeah. Dinner sounds great! [ Chuckles ] Yeah! Wait. The place where you eat dinner, does the moon shine through the window at night?
Finn: Sure.  
Morty Rogers: All right! Let's do it!
Bmo: Oh, ooh! And when Chips trips over the turtle, it was so funny! But also sad. It made me think about the fragility of my own life.
Morty Rogers: Just a little more...
Jake: Y'all ready for some Sushi burgers?
Morty Rogers: I don't eat burgers. Got any chips and ice cream? 
Jake: Uh...Sure. I just sculpted these buns, though.

Chips: Chips chips? 
Ice cream:  Ice cream... It worked! I'm a free bear! [ Laughs hysterically ]
Jake: Well, now I'm a guy with these things on my head. I guess I'm just gonna roll with the punches.
