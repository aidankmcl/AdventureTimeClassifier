Finn:  Careful! You'll wreck my gift for Princess Bubblegum.
Jake:  Whoops. Hey, what's it supposed to be, anyway?
Finn:  It's... a scale model of the Candy Kingdom, made out of my saliva! [Salivates]
Jake:  ...Sooo this means you wanna give 'er your spit, huh?
Finn:  Yup! [Realizing what he said] HEY, NO--
Jake:  It's okay, dude. I totally get it. Haw haw haw.
Finn:  I just wanted to give 'er somethin', uh... to celebrate her science... thing.
Jake:  You mean her... Super Science Barbecue?!
Finn:  You think it's science-y enough for 'er?
Jake:  Relax. She'll love it! [To himself] And then she'll love you. Heh heh heh...
Finn:  Wha?!
Jake:  Hey, there's Bubblegum! [Princess Bubblegum dumps charcoal on a grill.] Hide it behind your back, man! [Princess Bubblegum feeds Flambo a piece of charcoal.] Princess!
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh. Hi, guys! Just gettin' the grill cookin' for tonight's BBQ!
Finn:  Oh!
Princess Bubblegum:  What's that you got behind your back there, Finny?
Finn:  Oh, I... I made you somethin'.
Princess Bubblegum:  Really? Can I scope it?
Finn:  Yes. Close your eyes.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Doing so] A'ight.
Finn:  [Holding gift in front of her face] Get ready to open your eyes!
Princess Bubblegum:  Achoo! [She sneezes and pops all of the model's spit bubbles, destroying it.] Can I open my eyes?
Finn:  [Distressed noise] No, wait, uh, keep 'em closed for, like, three more hours!! [He salivates on the tray, attempting to make another model.]
Princess Bubblegum:  I'm gonna open my eyes. [She does so then gasps.] Oh, Finn! It's pink! I love pink! Oh, thanks, Finn!
Chet:  [Running up to the three] Princess! Princess!
Peppermint Butler:  [Walking up] Better not say nothing, you!
Princess Bubblegum:  Yes, Chet?
Chet:  Um... So, I called grill-meister for the BBQ, but Pepper won't give up the spatula!
Peppermint Butler:  Fine, fine. You can have it... [Running away] ...when you pry it from my cold, dead hands!!
Chet:  [Chasing after him] NOOOO!!
Princess Bubblegum:  Hey... If you two aren't watching the grill, then who's watching the.... [Noticing the grill is on fire] ...GRILL?!?!
Finn:  MEAT!! WAH!! [He knocks some steaks onto the fire then stabs a bunch of them so that they cling to his sword.] DIE, YOU FIRE!!! [He puts out the fire by piling the steaks on it.]
Princess Bubblegum:  [Walking up to him] Finn! That was awesome.
Finn:  Oh. Heh... Thanks, Princess. I'm always happy to help.
Princess Bubblegum:  I see. Your heroic brain is fascinating in a scientific way. Many scientific minds are going to be speaking at my barbeque. You should talk about something, too. You'll do that for me, right?
Finn:  [Mesmerized] Anything you want...
Princess Bubblegum:  Thanks, Finn! [She notices that Chet and Peppermint Butler are still fighting over the spatula.] Listen, I have to deal with this. [Walking away] See you tonight?
Finn:  [Blushing] Uh... Yeah! [He takes a reality check and starts breathing hard.]
Jake:  [Now a paper bag] Buddy, just breathe into me.
Finn:  Ah?
Jake:  [Turns back to normal] You're just gonna give a speech to a buncha' brainiacs.
Finn:  I can't hang with those guys. I'm full of stupid.
Jake:  Then we'll just borrow some brains by goin' to the place where knowledge liiives!
Finn:  Oh, Brain Town!
Jake:  Uh, no, the library.
Finn:  [Mysteriously] The Library of the Undead...
Jake:  No... Just the regular library.
Jake:  Hey, Finn, let's split. This turned out to be boring.
Finn:  But I have to cram this info!
Jake:  Okay, okay... I'll just keep readin' this book about figs.
Finn:  And I'll just read this book about pigs.
Jake:  Haha! Whatcha doin'?!
Finn:  I'm bored now, too!
Turtle Princess:  [Whispering] Shh! Hey! That's completely inappropriate! [She shoves them out.]
Finn:  But... w-w-we were just enthusiastic about learning!
Finn:  Hmm... So, if I can't book-learn for beans, we'll just get some smarty to explain scientific junk to me!
Jake:  Yeah, then you can at least sound smart... but where're you gonna find someone like that?
Finn:  Jake... we're goin' to college.
Professor worm:  And the great question endures... "Who would win in a battle between Nietzsche's Ubermensch... and Mandroid?" The answer is... [Angry] WEREWOLF QUEEN! IT'S ALWAYS WEREWOLF QUEEN!
Finn:  [Whispering to Jake] Rad!
Jake:  Heh heh heh heh heh.
Finn:  Jake. You can just shrink yourself down.
Jake:  Oh, yeah.
Professor Worm:  And when I finally meet the Werewolf Queen, she will take me on as her royal consort and we will rule in blood!
Finn:  Hey, teach. Can you talk more about scientific... uh... stuff and things?
Professor worm:  Well... sure, I could... [Irritated; raising voice] if this wasn't a class on THEORETICAL FIGHTONOMICS!
Finn:  [Awkwardly] Ohhh...
Professor worm:  Are you even in this class, Mister....
Finn:  Uh... Wormy... uh, Wormy McSquirmy!
Professor worm:  [Skeptical] McSquirmy, huh? Well, we'll just see about that, I-- [Pleasantly surprised] Oh! There you are. W. McSquirmy. I'm sorry. Yes, you're registered and you haven't shown up for a single class!
Worm:  Truancy hurts us all, McSquirmy!
Finn:  Hey! Ow! Please! Where's your compassion?!
Professor worm:  Let's kill 'im!!
Worms:  ASSAIL!!
Worm with glasses:  Excelsior! [He gets jabbed by Finn.]
Finn:  Jake, let's get outta here! [The professor worm strikes Finn's finger with a book.] OW! [He takes his hand out.]
Professor worm:  [Peeking out of apple] And stay out of Academia! [Goes back into apple]
Finn:  [Walking away with Jake following] Well... that's it. I'm all outta ideas on how to learn this junk.
Jake:  OH! Let's just solve this thing with magic!
Finn:  No... That's the easy way out.
Jake:  [Not seeing anything wrong] Yeah. It's the easy way out!
Finn:  [In realization] Oh! Oh, yeah! Let's go visit Choose Goose and his magical shack!
Choose Goose:  Magic, you say?! [Chuckles]
Finn:  Yeah, Choose Goose! I need magic! Some kind of mind-enhancing magic.
Choose Goose:  Ah, yes, the quest you are on, requires [Revealing them] the Glasses of Nerdicon!
Finn:  So... I just put those on, and then I'd be able to give that lecture... and Princess Bubblegum will totally dig it. Yeah! Whadaya want for it, CG?
Choose Goose:  Lately, I've been feeling drained. I only wish to be entertained.
Finn:  [Thinking] Hmm... Oh! [He starts scatting and wiggling his finger. Choose Goose laughs.]
Choose Goose:  Well done! The glasses, you have won! [Laughs]
Finn:  [Grabbing onto Jake] Everything small is just a small version of something big!! I understand everything!!
Jake:  Whoa, bud, are you okay?
Finn:  Oh, Jake... I'm better than okay. I know exactly how to impress the princess.
Jake:  More spit bubbles?
Finn:  No. No. Those spit bubbles were as fragile as my old perception of reality. But wait! Maybe you're on to something! I could show the princess bubbles the likes of which no one has ever seen!!
Jake:  And how will you do that?
Finn:  I'll start with a solid bulleted list!
Princess Bubblegum:  [To audience] Thanks again to Dr. Dextrose for sharing your fascinating research on the future of cuteness.
Finn:  Yes, yes, how charming. What... quaint notions.
Princess Bubblegum:  And now for a special guest lecture by one of Ooo's greatest heroes... Finn the Human!
Finn:  Ladies and gentlemen... and princess... [Winks at Princess Bubblegum, who waves back] I'm here to talk about multi-dimensional bubbles! But I'm not just going to talk about blowing bubbles! I'm going to blow... your... minds!
Princess Bubblegum:  Hmm?
Finn:  [Revealing bubble creator] This is a bubble-blower of my own design. With this, you can blow bubbles in different dimensions. [He sets the device to two dimensions and blows a bubble with no depth.] This two-dimensional bubble casts a one-dimensional shadow. [He sets the device to three dimensions and blows a normal, everyday bubble.] A three-dimensional bubble casts a two-dimensional shadow. [He sets the device to four dimensions and blows a three-dimensional shadow that appears to be a projection of a four-dimensional tesseract.] A fourth-dimensional bubble casts a three-dimensional shadow... IT IS BEYOND COMPREHENSION! [The audience is amazed.] Beyond space!! Beyond time!!
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn... that would mean you've created...
Finn:  Yes... A BLACK HOLE!!!
Princess Bubblegum:  FINN!! DO SOMETHING!!
Finn:  It's okay. I'm sure the solution is on my bulleted-- [Losing it] LIST!! [The list gets sucked in.] Don't worry. I have everything under control.
Princess Bubblegum:  UNDER CONTROL?! MY GUESTS ARE TERRIFIED!!
Finn: YES!! AND THEIR BRAINS ARE RELEASING ADRENALINE! DOPAMINE! EVEN DIMETHYLETRYPTAMINE FROM THE PINEAL GLAND! This has serious educational value!! Thanatophobia and this NDE is giving us euphoric altered awareness!! Don't you see, Princess?!? WE WERE ALL BORN TO DIE!!
Princess Bubblegum:  YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL US ALL?!?
Finn:  NO, OF COURSE NOT! I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE GREATEST CONFERENCE EVER!!!
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn...! You've gone insane!
Finn:  What?! No way! I'm, like, the smartest guy in Ooo, thanks to these glasses!
Princess Bubblegum:  Glasses? Finn... take those off. You're not yourself!
Finn:  But--
Princess Bubblegum:  [Eyes watering] Please!! I need the real you!
Finn:  What's goin' on?! [Noticing black hole] WHOA!!!
Princess Bubblegum:  You blew it, Finn! With this! [The bubble creator]
Finn:  Then I'll kill it... with this! [His golden sword]
Princess Bubblegum:  Be careful! [She loses her grip on the bubble creator and it comes hurling towards Finn.] Finn!! Look out!!
Finn:  Wha? Fourth-dimensional! Jake! Let me go!
Jake:  Finn!! Don't do anything stupid!!
Finn:  I can't help it, man!! [Unravels himself] I'm all about stupid!! YAAAAAAH!!! [He leaps into the black hole, readying his sword for attack.]
Jake and Princess Bubblegum:  FINN!!!!
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn... My Science Barbecue was a fiasco... [Cries]
Princess Bubblegum:  What's this? [Reading list] "Make hyper bubble. Cause black hole. Become insane. PB takes off the glasses. Save the day. Win the heart of the princess."? Finn, you knew all this would happen?!
Finn:  Huh? Knew what? I wrote that list when I was insane with smartness!
