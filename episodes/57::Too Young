Princess Bubblegum:  Finn? Finn? Finn! Where are you? I need you to try this!
Finn:  I'll be there in a sec! [takes phone from backpack, calls Jake]
Jake:  What's the status?
Finn:  Good, man!
Jake:  Nice! Seal the deal, bro!
Finn:  [laughs nervously] Okay, man! Whatevs!
Jake:  You can do it, you hear me?! [quickly] I'm playin' BMOcall me later, bye! [hangs up]
BMO:  How's Finn's date?
Jake:  I think it's goin' good.
BMO:  Unlike your game, boiiiii!
Jake:  Where's the key to the tower, BMO?! Tell me! AAAGH!
Finn:  Okay, Finn. She's 13; you're 13. Just have fun! Be yourself. [raises arms above head in robotic way] Wooooo!
Finn:  What's that? Are you trying to make yourself 18 again?
Princess Bubblegum:  Nah. This is an instant bath serum. It makes you sweat cleaning agents.
Finn:  I don't bathe. I want that!
Finn:  WAAAUGH! Hot, hot, ohWAAAAUGH! Oh... so spice! So spice!
Princess Bubblegum:  [kneels down beside Finn and touches him playfully] YOU'RE so spice!
Manfried:  Bwaaa bwaaa bwaaaaaa! [imitating trumpet] Announcing the arrival of the Earl of Lemongrab!
Cinnamon Bun:  Heh hah hah- AAAAUGH! Oof! Ha ha ha!
Earl of Lemongrab:  This castle is... in... UNACCEPTABLE CONDITIIIIOOOON! UNACCEPTABLLLEEE!
Earl of Lemongrab:  [points into the room] Thirty days in the dungeon!
Cinnamon Bun:  [still on floor] For who?
Earl of Lemongrab:  Everyone in this ROOM! [raises his arms up over his head, and his eyes widen] MMMLLUUUUUGH!!!
Princess Bubblegum:  Wait, wait! You can't give orders like that! I'm in charge here, Lemongrab!
Earl of Lemongrab:  [eyes widen again nervously, he points at Princess Bubblegum] TOO YOUNG! TOO YOUNG TO RULE THE KINGDOM!
Finn:  Watch your manners with the princess--!
Earl of Lemongrab:  [cuts Finn off, holding his hand] HHHHUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOH?!
Finn:  What the huh?
Earl of Lemongrab:  MMMM! [purses lips] HAH! [gasps, and begins rubbing his sore hand] I am next in line to thee throne! Sooo... I will be in charge... UNTIL PRINCESS BUBBLEGUM turns... 18 again!
Finn:  That's bunk! Right, Preebos?
Princess Bubblegum:  No... He is rightful ruler under kingdom law. It's complicated. [looks down in shame] I created Lemongrab.
Finn:  [gasps]
Princess Bubblegum:  He was the first of my experiments gone wrong...
Earl of Lemongrab:  Nnnnnnuh!
Earl of Lemongrab:  Gaaaaaah!
Earl of Lemongrab:  EEEEEEAAAAAAGH!
Princess Bubblegum:  [looking mortified and frightened, she gasps]
Princess Bubblegum:  ... And now that I'm younger than him, he inherits the right to the throne.
Earl of Lemongrab:  IF ANYONE NEEDS ME I'LL BE TAKING A NAP! A...a-a-and CLEAN this place up or dungeon! THREE HOURS DUNGEON!
Starchie:  Who are you talking to?!
Earl of Lemongrab:  THREE! HOURS! DUNGEON!
Starchie:  [clenches fists and screams in outrage/defeat] NNNNOOOOOOOO!!!
Finn:  We'll see you in a few hours... okay, Starchie?
Starchie:  [walking away dejectedly] Yeah, right... If Starchie ever survives that long...
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn, this is dirt balls! We gotta do something to make him leave!
Finn:  Yeah... like pranking him up his face!
Princess Bubblegum:  Hey, yeah! And I have the perfect prank! C'mon, Finn!
Earl of Lemongrab:  [sleepily] Huh? [reaches over to nightstand, puts on reading glasses, squints, and keeps his hand on the side of his glasses as he reads to himself] "You... really... smell... like... ... dog buns"...?
Earl of Lemongrab:  NNNUUUUuuuuuooooooooooOOOOOOOOUUUUUUGGGGHHH!!!
Earl of Lemongrab:  Well, well, well... IS THIS EVERYONE, THEN?!
Peppermint Butler:  Yes, all the castle staff.
Earl of Lemongrab:  Sooo which one of yooou WAS it?! Who did... the THING?!
Upside-Down Ice Cream Cone:  The... thing?
Earl of Lemongrab:  [clenches fists angrily] FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU-- [eyes widen]UUUMMMM!!! [unpockets the Dog Buns note, and unfolds it, showing it to the Candy People. He points at it, trembling frantically] THE THING, THE THING!!!
Peppermint Butler:  Hey, man! Calm down! [gently tugging on the leg of Lemongrab's jumpsuit] It's just a prank, man! For laughs!
Earl of Lemongrab:  Prank? F... for... laughs? [looking confused] Yes, of course... Just a harmless prank... f-for laughs... Ahhh... [bursts into a wide, jovial grin, then suddenly looks startled, and begins laughing, with the same startled expression, as his head bounces with every laugh as strange squishing noises play over the soundtrack] HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH- OH! HAOAHOAHAOAHOAHAOAHAOHAO
Peppermint Butler:  Heh, heh...
Earl of Lemongrab:  [continued] HAHAHAOAHAHAOAAHA- [facial expression returns to his usual blank one, and he abruptly stops laughing. He turns to Peppermint Butler and says quickly:] Twelve years dungeon. [turns to Candy People] All of youdungeon! Seven years, no trials! [shakes head disapprovingly] C'mon... LET'S MOVE IT!!!
Princess Bubblegum:  [sighs] I don't think that worked out too math, Finn.
Finn:  What? No, no! He just needs some more prankin's to finish the job! He'll leave the kingdom. Let's try it my way this time, okay?
Princess Bubblegum:  Okay!
Earl of Lemongrab:  OOF!
Earl of Lemongrab:  [whimpers softly, as fat tears stream from his eyes] Cough, cough! [he continues to cry pitifully, obviously in much pain] Oooooh... [He suddenly looks up with a smile on his face at Princess Bubblegum and Finn as they run off, and laughs a broken, cracking laugh, triumphantly raising his fist into the air] Ha, ha-ha... GOOD ONE! [coughs a terrible-sounding cough into his fist, and cringes again, then looks up at the pranksters with another smile] Keep 'em coming! I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE!!! Ho... ha... Ah-ah-oooow!
Finn:  I got a new plan!
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, yeah? What?
Finn:  We'll work together and use that serum you made. The one that was "Ah! So Spice!" And spice-bomb him non-stop 'till his butt falls out! How's that sound?
Princess Bubblegum:  [sighs, and smiles contentedly, leaning her head on Finn's shoulder]
Finn:  Hoooo! [exhaling nervously, his cheeks red with blush]
Peppermint Butler:  Thank you for releasing me early from the dungeon, Master Lemongrab.
Earl of Lemongrab:  I determine what is early, and what is late, Mr. Peppermint! [Closes his eyes and makes a slight bowing gesture to his butler]
Peppermint Butler:  Yes, Your Earlness.
Earl of Lemongrab:  Also... I don't know where food comes from! [points at Peppermint Butler]
Peppermint Butler:  My Lord, food comes from Ma--
Earl of Lemongrab:  NOOOOOOOOHH!! That's why I am royal and you are servile!
Finn:  You ready to pour the stuff?
Princess Bubblegum:  Yeah! I made it super-hot this time!
Finn:  Wait 'till he opens the lid!
Peppermint Butler:  Behold: a plate of mashed carrots, flavor--
Princess Bubblegum:  Shoot!
Peppermint Butler:  HHHHAAAAAAA!!! HAAAAAAA! HAAAAAAA!!!! AAAAAAAGHAAA!!!!!
Finn:  Shh!
Earl of Lemongrab:  [screaming] STOP SCREAMING!!! WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING?!
Peppermint Butler:  Because I'm excited by this meal I made!
Earl of Lemongrab:  Me, too. I'm excited, too.
Earl of Lemongrab:  HHHHUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
Peppermint Butler:  He's eating the dirt! SPICE IT NOW!
Peppermint Butler:  He's heading for the orchard!
Earl of Lemongrab:  Apple!
Earl of Lemongrab:  Mmmm!
Finn:  Heh, heh... heh! [laughs nervously, as Lemongrab spots him and Princess Bubblegum]
Earl of Lemongrab:  OOOOOONE MILLION YEEEEEEEARS, DUNGEON!!!!
Finn:  Maybe if we... set his butt on fire.
Princess Bubblegum:  No, Finn... There's only one way. I just didn't want to have to do it. If I change myself back to my real age, I can reclaim the throne.
Finn:  What? No! I mean... you can do that?
Princess Bubblegum:  [nods solemnly]
Finn:  Then... why did you wait so long?
Princess Bubblegum:  Because being 13 again is... Bloobaloobie!
Finn:  Hm?
Princess Bubblegum:  While being 18 is all plock dumps and wagglezags... I never really get to act like a kid. But, it's okay. Really. My people need me, and that comes first!
Finn:  Yeaaah...
Princess Bubblegum:  First thing we need is more candy flesh to increase my biomass. But I need my lab equipment to engineer it.
Peppermint Butler:  Not necessarily, milady!
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, thank you! Thank you, all! Okay... Next we need a bonding agent.
Finn:  Princess? I think I can help.
Finn:  Finished!
Princess Bubblegum:  There's one last thing we need. [starts to blush] Only the heat from a whopping love hug can catalyze the re-age-ifying process.
Finn:  [holds Princess Bubblegum's hands, then also blushes] Are you ready, Princess?
Princess Bubblegum:  Yes, Finn. But... first, I just want to say how much fun I've had hanging out with you.
Finn:  Me, too!
Princess Bubblegum:  And I... I wish I could stay... like this, with you, but--
Finn:  I... I know, Princess.
Princess Bubblegum:  'Scuse, me, Finn. [Gently nudges Finn aside, and approaches the dungeon door] Yo, Earl!
Earl of Lemongrab:  [from far away] WHAAAAAT?!
Princess Bubblegum:  Hey! You're fired, ya BUTT!
Earl of Lemongrab:  HHHHHRRRRRGGGRRRUUGGHHH!!!!!
Princess Bubblegum:  I'm so glad everything's back to normal. Thanks for all your help, Finn.
Finn:  Oh- you're welcome! But... uhm...
Princess Bubblegum:  What is it, Finn?
Finn:  Well, ah... Do you... do you wanna hug some more?
Princess Bubblegum:  What? Finn, you silly! That was, like, five years ago! You really gotta move on.
Finn:  Oh- yeah, yeah... Sorry...
Princess Bubblegum:  Such a silly boy.
Finn:  Hello?
Jake:  Hey, man! What's the status?
Finn:  Bad news, man... I... I got dumped.
Jake:  Awww. I'm sorry, Finn. But look, man. Lemme share with you a little secret on how to win the heart of a princess. It's not easy, but ya have to be persistent. You might have to defeat a demon lord, and warp through several worlds.
Jake:  But once you do, you walk up the wizard stairs, and produce your magic key you got in a water world and unlock the chamber door. Then, walk right up to the princess, and give her a smooch.
Jake:  Yesss! [triumphantly] Does that make sense?
Finn:  Yeah, man. I see what you're sayin'. Thanks, Jake.
Jake:  Mmm-hmm.
Finn:  [to himself] Go up the wizard steps.
