Finn: Tree Trunks! The slumber party is about to start. Get those hot buns in here, girl!
Finn: Did you hear me? I said, "Get those hot--"!
Finn: Hi, Mr. Pig.
Finn: Why are you hitting me?
Finn: I was just talking about Tree Trunks's hot--.
Princess Bubblegum: Come on, Finn! We're doing music chairs.
Chet: Everyone ready?
Everyone: Ready!
Chet: Take a seat!
Princess Bubblegum: Uh, uh...
Finn: Uh-oh, uh-oh!
Mr. Cupcake: There's a seat by me.
Finn & Princess Bubblegum: Oh! Heh.
Finn: You take it, Princess. This is your party.
Princess Bubblegum: You take it, Finn. You're my guest.
Finn & Princess Bubblegum: No, no, I insist!
Chet: Time is up. You two must now be sent to the closest closet to have heavenly thoughts.
Chet: Heavenly thoughts. [shuts door]
Finn: Hey, PB.
Princess Bubblegum: Hey, Finn.
Finn: [puts a toothpick in his mouth] Mm?
Princess Bubblegum: Bup, bup, bup. Hey, you wanna ditch the party and go for a walk?
Finn: Wha--? Really?
Princess Bubblegum: It's been a while since we just hung out, you know?
Finn: What about the Candy People?
Princess Bubblegum: Ah, they should be fine, right? For once? Maybe they'll surprise me by being fine. Come on. [pushes aside some coats]
Finn: Whoa!
Princess Bubblegum: Secret passage.
Finn: Noice.
Manfried: Boy, it's sure quiet in there. What's going on in there, you think?
Crunchy: Someone should listen at the door.
Mr. Cupcake: We nominate you, Crunchy, to go listen at the door.
Dr. Donut: And tell everybody what's going on.
Crunchy: Eh, what? Why me?
Starchie: Come on, Crunchy. You're the go-to guy. You're the new Cinnamon Bun. [leads him to the door]
Crunchy: No, I'm not. [leans against door]
Gumdrop Lass 1: What do you hear?
Dr. Donut: Yeah, paint us a picture, Crunchy.
Crunchy: I hear, like, uh, like, a lush, green field... next to a white picket fence. Finn and the princess both brought picnic baskets. Oh, but they brought the same stuff, and they're laughing about it. And now they're kissing.
Chocoberry: There's no lush, green field in that closet!
Crunchy: Well, you guys asked me to paint a picture.
Chocoberry: Just tell us what you hear!
Crunchy: I can't hear anything. They must be just lightly brushing their lips together.
Starchie: Or... maybe they kissed so much they passed out! Crunchy, open that door!
Mr. Cupcake: Step aside, Crunchy. I'll make short work of this door opening. [crushes knob] Oh. I guess I'm just too strong. [flexes and winks]
Gumdrop Lass 1: [gasps] Then they're trapped! What if they ran out of air?
Mr. Cupcake: No air? I'll smash down the door!
Chet: Stop!
Mr. Cupcake: Huh?
Chet: Mr. Cupcake, your mighty strength might kill them! There's a drill and saw in the supply room, though.
Mr. Cupcake: In here, you say? [walks to another door]
Candy People: No, don't!
Candy People: Aw...
Jake: Yo, guys! You gotta do something! That's my best friend in there! [texts on his phone] "You okay in there?"
Finn: [texting] Yeah, we went out the secret coat passage.
Princess Bubblegum: It's so nice to get away sometimes.
Finn: Hmm. Candy peeps can be a handful, huh? [waves to horses]
Princess Bubblegum: Yeah. They mean well, though. You wanna meet Timmy?
Princess Bubblegum: [high-pitched] Timmy!
Finn: Aw! So squish!
Princess Bubblegum: Hop on!
Finn: Okay. [hops on]
Candy People: Breathe!
Candy People: Breathe!
Candy People: Breathe!
Chet: Wait. Wait! Don't Candy People breathe out, like, poisonous gas or something? Something like... [stammering] carbo... carrin dio--
Jake: I know! It's called... [farts into pillow] And it is deadly.
Candy People: [screaming]
Chocoberry: Suck it back out! Suck it back out!
Candy People: [screaming]
Chet: Cupcake's dead! What do we do?!
Jake: Ha-a. [eats chips]
Princess Bubblegum: So got any other weekend plans?
Finn: Mmm... probably gonna hit up the arts and crafts kingdom with BMO. You?
Princess Bubblegum: Oh, I'm gonna garden some, plan next week's pizza lunch, answer 800 e-mails, and... you know, whatever.
Finn: Wows. Do you ever get tired from doing princess work all the time?
Princess Bubblegum: Sure. I mean, it's a lot of responsibility [picks a fruit] looking after so many people, though lately I have been trying to be more chill about it. [pulls seeds out of fruit and showers Finn with them]
Finn: Cool, like taking ice cream breaks?
Princess Bubblegum: Yeah, and, like, being more... sorta okay with everyone making mistakes around me. Like "mind my own stuff" more. You know what I mean?
Finn: Yeah. Kind of like how I've been thinking about my dad and how I want him to act more like daddy. But, but maybe acting like daddy just isn't what he does. Maybe my dad's not a dad but a kid stuck in a dad's body.
Princess Bubblegum: [gasps]
Finn: [laughs] Timmy knows what's up!
Princess Bubblegum: Timmy!
Finn & Princess Bubblegum: Timmy!
Manfried: Okey-dokey, everybody! Check it out!
Manfried: Once in place, this sweater will muffle the cannonball explosion perfectly, allowing the frame around the door to gently fall apart, freeing Finn and PB.
Mr. Cupcake: Manfried's a good leader because we can always see him.
Manfried: Now the cannon should go right over here. [spins around] Oh, wait. Here. [points with foot]
Jake: [laughs]
Chocoberry: Aren't you worried about Finn?
Jake: Of course I am! See these tears of worry? [produces fake tears]
Chocoberry: [pats his arm] It will be okay, Jake.
Finn (voiceover): PB is showing me all this cool stuff. She has an awesome shirt. How's the party?
Manfried: Okay, everyone, prepare for the boom.
Manfried: Three... two...
Colonel Candy Corn: Fire!
Colonel Candy Corn: Aw, my cannon.
Manfried: Uh-oh.
Banana Guard: Hey, the closet's open!
Crunchy: So they're dead, right?
Ice Cream Guy: Chocoberry can tell us! She saw a ghost at my house once.
Chocoberry: Oui, it's true. I have the gift. [walks into closet, eyes closed] Yes. I sense their spirits.
Chocoberry: Finn says... He says, "Remember to feed BMO." [gasps, cries]
Colonel Candy Corn: That idea stank, Manfried! I'm calling the shots from now on.
Mr. Cupcake: No! Manfried is still the most clearly visible.
Jake: Hey, why don't you guys team up and fight each other to see who gets to wear the crown. [points to painting of Princess Bubblegum]
Jake: [laughs]
Crunchy: [laughs menacingly]
Princess Bubblegum: Here, try this one.
Finn: [takes a sip] Mmm... fire.
Princess Bubblegum: [laughs] You got a little edible fire mustache there.
Finn: What? [views himself on his phone's camera and laughs] Gonna send this to Jake. [takes a picture]
Jake (voiceover): Check it out.
Princess Bubblegum: Hey, what's that?
Finn: Uh, it's--
Princess Bubblegum: Let me see.
Finn: Mm. You won't like it, but okay. [hands her his phone]
Princess Bubblegum: I'll worry about it later.
Finn: Oh.
Princess Bubblegum: You wanna see the burrito room?
Finn: Yuss!
Colonel Candy Corn: This is a brutal new society. For a society to function, it needs rules. 1. You must drink tea with your pizza. 2. Pizza can only be eaten alone. 3. If a pizza is found in a field, you must make the next person you see holding a glass of milk eat it.
Crunchy: Sire, I must congratulate you on becoming princess.
Colonel Candy Corn: Thank you.
Crunchy: Is there anything I can do or get for you?
Colonel Candy Corn: Anything?
Crunchy: Anything.
Colonel Candy Corn: Could you perhaps procure a pizza?
Crunchy: [darkly] Yes. [walks backwards]
Jake: Man, this is intense. I better do something! [takes a bunch of selfies]
Finn: Thanks for showing me around, PB. I've enjoyed just, just hanging out.
Princess Bubblegum: Me, too!
Finn: [laughs] Jake just sent me a funny picture of himself. [hands phone to Princess Bubblegum]
Princess Bubblegum: Whoa. It looks like the Candy People's makeshift government has been taken over by a ruthless despot.
Finn: What? Why aren't you freaking out?
Princess Bubblegum: Eh, it was worth giving them a shot. Let's go back to the party, though. It looks like we have to save it.
Colonel Candy Corn: Neigh! Whinny!
Candy People: [chanting] Crunchy! Crunchy! Crunchy!
Crunchy: To the crater!
Crunchy: Any last words, Starchie?
Starchie: You smell.
Crunchy: Throw him in!
Princess Bubblegum: What's going on here?
Candy People: Uh...
Jake: They devolved into beasts. It has hilarious.
Princess Bubblegum: Okay, everybody get into your sleeping bags, and I'll read you a story.
Princess Bubblegum: [clears throat] Modern menswear can be traced back two hundred years. Furs and textiles became easier to produce...
