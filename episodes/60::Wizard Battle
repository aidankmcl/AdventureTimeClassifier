Finn:  Jake.
Finn:  [Whispering] Wizard Battle is starting soon!
Jake:  [Pushes Finn away, groans] I know! We got here six hours early, you dork! Just wake me up when they start selling hot dogs. [sees that he is laying on a hot dog] Whoa! What do you know! [Eee gasp]
Finn:  The wizards are arriving!
Finn:  Whoo-hoo! Yeah!!!
Grand Master Wizard:  [Offscreen] Ladies and gentlemen...
Finn:  [Gasps repeatedly]
Grand Master Wizard:  I am the Grand Master Wizard of Ceremonies. And now, the rules. Contestants will fight each other with spells from the eight schools of magic. [Science Whyzard enters] No science, Science Whyzard! [She leaves, Weapon Head enters] No weapons, Weapon Head! [Weapon Head pouts and takes of his weapon head and throws it into a pile of prohibited wizard stuff and makes fire from his hands] To enter Wizard Battle, you must be a wizard!
Finn:  [Looking through binoculars] Whoo, wizard only allowed! Whoo. Whoo. Wh-...[Sees Ice King] Oh, what? Ice King!
Jake:  Boo!
Finn:  You're a contestant?!
Ice King:  Mm-hmm. You guys come here to watch me win?
Finn:  Phshoo, you're gonna lose, man.
Jake:  You're a loser.
Ice King:  Ha! I'm not gonna lose! I've got a foolproof plan for winning. [Whispers] I'm gonna cheat. [Laughs]
Grand Master Wizard:  And now L's and G's, witness the unveiling of this tournaments grand prize, [A curtain rises over the blimps cockpit revealing Princess Bubblegum] A kiss from Princess Bubblegum! [Princess Bubblegum starts posing with her lips as the crowds cheer] On the mouth!
Lady Wizard #1:  Boooo. Boo.
Brain Wizard:  Hmm. Is it an open mouth kiss?
Grand Master Wizard:  No!
Brain Wizard:  Then I choose to exit the battle.
Grand Master Wizard:  No one is allowed to exit Wizard Battle! [Turns the four wizards into cats; the door closes] The doors are shut. [A barrier covers the stadium. A bird flies by but gets hit by the barrier] The sky barrier is in place. All of you will kiss the princess or die in battle.
Ice King:  Ooh, I just can't wait to taste that sweet Bubblegum. [Flies off happy]
Finn:  [blushing] Jake, we gotta enter the contest and stop Ice King.
Jake:  But we're not wizards, man. What about the sanctity and honor of Wizard Battle?
Finn:  I'd rather sanctify PB's lips.
Jake:  Ooooh! You don't care about the Ice King. You just wanna kiss Princess Bubblegum.
Finn:  No! I wanna save the princess!
Jake:  Mm-hmm. Yeah, you do.
Finn:  I do!
Jake:  Yeah, you do.
Finn:  Oh, shush! [Carries Jake off]
Finn:  Now, where's the Ice King.
Jake:  Over there!
Ice King:  [Checking his breath] Oh, yeah.
Finn:  We need a plan, man.
Jake:  Okay. When the wizards start to battle, let's go hide behind that rock.
Grand Master Wizard:  By the rays of the setting sun, the battle of wizards has begun!
Jake:  Looks like everyone had the same plan.
Finn:  What are they waiting for?
Abracadaniel:  The opposites.
Finn:  Huh?
Abracadaniel:  The wizards with opposite powers will take each other on first.
Finn:  And are you a wizard?
Abracadaniel:  Yes. My name is Abracadaniel. [Tries to make a rainbow appear but can only keep it up for a few seconds]
Finn:  Hi, Abracadaniel. My name is, uh, Magic... [Jake forms his hand into a fist] Fist.
Jake:  [Pops his head out of the head hole] Whoa. This kid looks like a wimp.
Abracadaniel:  Who's that?
Finn:  He's my, uh, magic second head.
Abracadaniel:  Well, he's right. [Sighs] I only entered this contest 'cause I thought the prize would be money. But it's just a kiss!
Finn:  You mean, you don't care about kissing PB?
Abracadaniel:  Blegh, no way. If I was the winner, I would turn my face so our lips [gasps] wouldn't touch and I would push Princess away. Turn and push, turn and push, turn and push...
Finn:  [To Jake]
Abracadaniel:  ...turn and push, turn and push. Well, I'm going back to my cave to wait for someone to kill me. Goodbye.
Finn:  Wait! Abracadanny, don't you worry about a thing. I'm gonna protect you.
Abracadaniel:  You will?
Finn:  Yeah, man. Also, I have an idea for how you can help me save PB's lips.
Abracadaniel:  Oh, okay.
Ice King:  Yeaah!
Finn:  [Gasps] Cheating!
Finn:  He's using a weapon!
Jake:  Why isn't the Grand Master Wizard seeing this?
Ice King:  Nun-chucks vanish! [The nun-chucks retract into his sleeve] Boo yah!
Finn:  Now's my chance to stop him.
Finn:  Huwahh?!
Abracadaniel:  Rock Wizard!
Rock Wizard:  Arrgghh! Come to me, meteor shower! Rock Wizard compels you!
Abracadaniel:  Cantrip!
Rock Wizard:  Huh?
Finn:  [Gasp] No! [Finn dodges the meteors] Jake, two o' clock!
Finn:  Okay, now to stop the [Sees Abracadaniel] Ice Kiiing...?
Abracadaniel:  My body is squishy. That's how I survived.
Finn:  Whoa! That's turbo amazing!
Finn:  Stay close to me, Abracadaniel.
Cyclo:  What?! You turned me pink, bro!
Grand Master Wizard:  Three wizards remain. Time to get real. I wanna see some crazy wiz biz!
Ice King:  Wiz biz! Wiz biz! Oh, I can almost taste those sweet lips. [Makes a make-out face; Abracadaniel cringes]
Finn:  [Whispering] Quick, listen! Now's the time for you to help me. [Whispers in Abracadaniel's ear]
Ice King:  Hey, guys. Guys? What are you whispering? Come on! I gotta a surprise for yous fools.
Ice King:  Yeah. That's right. Just a little closer. [Reaches into his sleeve] Ooh, what's in here? In my little sleevey hole? [Pulls out his nun-chucks]
Finn:  [To Abracadaniel] Watch out, man.
Ice King:  Whoo!
Finn:  You got this, Danny boy!
Ice King:  My nun-chucks! Nooo!!
Abracadaniel:  Yes! [Breathes hard] I did it! I really did it. I'm a true wizard.
Ice King:  I have powers too, you butts! Yahh! Ice sword! [Creates an ice sword] Ice Shield! [Creates an ice shield]
Abracadaniel:  Abracadaniel! [Shoots another rainbow at the butterfly and it turns back into the nunchucks]
Ice King:  Wha? What you say? [Nunchucks fall on his head] B'oh! [Falls unconcious]
Finn:  Good job, Danny. You're not a wimp anymore. You should feel pretty good.
Abracadaniel:  I do. I feel real good.
Finn:  I'm gonna forfeit now. I only wanted to stop the Ice King.
Jake:  [Pops out of the shirt] Uh-uh.
Finn:  I forfeit! I forfeit, everyone!
Finn:  Meow.
Jake:  Whoa.
Grand Master Wizard:  Abracadaniel wins! You are the greatest wizard in Ooo!
Abracadaniel:  Oh, w-w-well thank you, Grand Master Wizard. I guess through this trial I have become a great wizard. I, I came here with no self-esteem and no chances, a will-o-wisp of a boy, but I walk out this arena a man. A confident man! Who deserves a kiss from a princess!
Finn:  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
Grand Master Wizard:  It appears you have knocked out Abracadaniel using the most shameful of all magic, a power shriek. [The crowd grumbles in discontent] But since you are the last wizard, you are the winner of Wizard Battle. [The crowd cheers] Go get ready for your kiss, champ.
Finn:  [Sighs]
Jake:  [Comes out from under the cloak] Wow, man.
Finn:  What?
Jake:  I've never heard you scream like that before. You were all like, "Nooo! No one kisses her but me!"
Finn:  Yeah, okay! I want to kiss her, alright? You got me! The big secret is out! Okay, Jake. I like Princess Bubblegum! ARE YOU HAPPY, JAKE?!
Finn:  Whoa, Jake. Don't cry, man. I'm not really mad at you.
Finn:  I'm just sick of having to hide my feelings all the driz. It's exhausting.
Jake:  Then stop hiding you feelings, man! Go out there, and smooch it up!
Finn:  Heh heh. Yeah, alright, man.
Grand Master Wizard:  You ready in there?
Finn:  Yeah, I'm coming!
Finn:  Ooh, whoa!
Finn:  Oh, dag.
Princess Bubblegum:  What's going on here?
Finn:  Uh, Ice King was cheating his way through Wizard Battle using nun-chucks, so Jake and I faked being wizards to save you from having to kiss him and we uh, [Sighs] I dishonored Wizard Battle.
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, Finn, ...you did all that for me? [Kisses Finn] That's for being sweet. [Slaps him] And that's for cheating. Finn, you know better than to ruin the sanctity of Wizard Battle. Wizards only, silly. Okay, everyone! Go home! Start getting ready for next year!
Finn:  Heh heh, oh, well.
Jake:  Good job. You got the kiss, man.
Finn:  Thanks, man. My face hurts a little.
Jake:  Don't worry about that, 'cause you look totally cool right now.
Finn:  Thanks, dude. [Puts the mask on Jake] Here, you try 'em.
Jake:  Okay, am I cool now?
Finn:  So fly.
Ice King:  [Out of nowhere, wearing purple sunglasses] How 'bout me? Put me on the grid, scale of one to ten. One is "totally gross," ten is like, "Hey, Ice King. You look crazy sick."
