Finn:  Do you think it's right for Marceline to invite us to jam without Princess and BMO?
Jake:  It's just a jam sesh. Is that what you're gonna jam with?
Finn:  Yeah, man. Balloon music is the future. Listen. [He starts rubbing his balloon and demonstrates balloon music by rapping the Extremities Song.]
Jake:  Pretty good. [They continue walking and come up to Marceline's house.] I don't think you mastered it yet.
Finn:  Well, duh. I just started.
Jake:  Oh, dude. There's a note.
Finn:  What's it say?
Jake:  [Reading note on Marceline's door] "Hey, guys, I had to run out, but I'll be back," blee-bloo-blop, "Don't go in my house."
Finn:  That's it?
Jake:  Yeah. Just "Don't go in my house" in all caps... written in blood.
Finn:  Hmm. [Finn rubs his balloon and sits down; Jake also sits down and closes his eyes.] What are you doing?
Jake:  Eliminating desire from my heart. It helps pass the time.
Finn:  Come on! I can't do that! Let's play Cloud Hunt 'til she gets here.
Jake:  No, man, I got a mental block with Cloud Hunt!
Finn:  Yeah, that's what makes it awesome, 'cause I know I'll win.
Jake:  Oh, what?! Bring it on, brother! Now explain the rules 'cause I forget.
Finn:  Okay. I count to ten and you go hide somewhere. Then, I gotta try to find you. You can hide... anywhere in here. Anywhere in here, ...but Marcy's house is off limits because she said so. Okay?
Jake:  Got it.
Finn:  Okay. I'm gonna start counting. Ready?
Jake:  [Glances at Marceline's house] Yes.
Finn:  Go! One... [Jake runs towards Marceline's house.] Two... Three... Four... Five... Four...
Finn:  Cloud Hunt... GOTCHA! Huh. Hmm. [Checks under porch] AH-HA! [Finds nothing and goes on porch; spots Jake] JAKE! [Jake starts mirroring Finn.] Get out of there! Marceline's gonna kill you! Jake! I know this isn't a mirror. What the?! You're doing it wrong, even! Get out! Get out!! [Finn goes inside. Jake spots him and continues mirroring him.] Dude, get out of there! She's gonna kill us! She'll be home any minute! Did you read the note?! I mean, you read the note! You told it to me!! [Gasps and tackles Jake]
Marceline:  [sniffs] Smells like sourdough in here.
Jake:  She's gonna kill us. Once she finds out she's gonna tie us up and eat us like a spider.
Finn:  You don't think I know that?! Hmmmmmmm... We'll wait for the right moment and sneak out... right under her big, fat caboose.
Jake:  Okay, man. I can do this. [Begins pumping his fist] Egh! Egh! Egh!!
Finn:  Shh, here she comes!
Jake:  Here she comes...
Finn:  Shh, shh!!
Marceline:  Huh.
Jake:  Let's get outta here.
Marceline:  Hello?
Jake:  She didn't wash hands!
Marceline:  Is someone here?
Finn:  [To Jake] Shh!!
Marceline: That's what stinks. [Finn and Jake look relieved.] Where are those dweebs? [Dials cell phone; it begins to ring.]
Finn [on voicemail]:  This is Jake!
Jake [on voicemail]:  And this is Finn!
Finn & Jake [on voicemail]:  We're not home right now, so... [They laugh some more. Finn and Jake begin snickering in the closet.] ...leave a message! [Marceline notices sounds from her closet; Finn and Jake [in the closet] quiet down.] Leave a message! [Tone sounds.]
Marceline:  Uh... Yeah, hey, you guys. Are you still coming over? It's jam time, so, like, call me, 'kay?
Jake:  Whatcha doin'?
Finn:  [Kneels down holding a piece of paper and a pencil] Get down. [Uses Jake's back as a writing platform. When Finn finishes writing, the note reads, "MARCY, PLEASE COME TO THE TREEHOUSEIT'S AN AMERGENCY! [sic] Love, FINN + JAKE"] When she gets this, she'll leave and we can escape!
Jake:  Brilliant... but how's it gonna work?
Finn:  I'll fly the paper as an airplane down the bedroom ladder. It'll triple barrel roll past the kitchen, open the fridge, and cook some eggs, then eat the eggs, and unfold itself as it lays in the carpet in front of Marceline's door!
Jake:  Yeah, yeah, awesome, yeah!!
Jake:  No, nah, nuts!
Marceline:  Welp... they're not gonna show up, then I'll just work on my own stuff, I guess. [Plays bass and activates recording equipment.] Take one for new concept album based on five hundred years of my journal entries. So here's some preliminary notes. [sighing] I... I wanna make this the most emotional album ever. So private and secret, that I'll never let anyone hear.
Jake:  [Whispering to Finn] This is so wrong.
Marceline:  No one can ever hear it. Ever. Take one.
Jake:  [Making a hole in the wall with a spoon] We've crossed the line! I'm gettin' outta here, man!
Finn:  Yeah! Do it!
Finn:  What? What's it doing?!
Finn & Jake:  Shh, shh, shh!!
Marceline:  Oh, what?! What happened?! Ugh! [She glares at the closet with a scowl, and the duo shrinks back. She hisses, and the duo scrambles around frantically. She opens the closet door.] Where are you?! Oh, there you are... My broom.
Marceline:  [sighs] [muttering to herself] Stupid... thing Get... [exasperated] NO! Stupid [kicks the piece] UGH!! [exasperated noise] [She throws the broom in the closet and ends up dirtying herself.] Ugh!
Finn:  Is it safe?
Jake:  I dunno, man. Go scope the scene.
Jake:  What happened, man?
Finn:  [Talking quickly] I'm not goin' back out there.
Jake:  Well... whaddaya mean? What happened? [Finn stares blankly.] Bro?
Finn:  Is she awake?
Jake:  Why are you talking?!
Finn:  I'm wondering if she's awake.
Jake:  Well, if she's awake, she can definitely hear you talking!
Finn:  I'm whispering.
Jake:  Well, now we're both quietly screaming.
Marceline:  [Awake] I can hear both of you.
Finn [Whispering still]:  Disguise yourself, fool!
Marceline:  What're you bozos doing in my lair?
Jake:  Dude, I think she sees us!
Finn:  What the?! DUDE! You shape-changed to look like me?! [Throws the lampshade at Jake]
Jake:  Well, yeah!
Marceline:  HEY! [Hissing] Exssssplain yourselves.
Finn:  [sighing] We were playing hide-and-seek in your closet and you came home, so we hid in there all day. We saw... everything. And, oh, Glob, I mean, whatever you do to us, I just wanna say, we're sorry.
Jake:  So sorry.
Marceline:  [Not seeing anything wrong] Okay... apology accepted.
Jake:  What?!
Marceline:  I hide in your house all the time.
Marceline:  Anyways, no hard feelings, guys! See you soon!
Finn:  Marceline? [covers himself] Jake! Jake!
Jake:  Hmm? [He covers himself with a towel even though he was already wearing one. He goes to the bedroom.] Hey, man, did
Finn:  AAAAAAH!!
Jake:  AAAAAAH!!
