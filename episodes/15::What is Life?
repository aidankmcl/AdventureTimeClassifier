Jake:  Hey, man. [Chuckles deviously]
Finn:  What's so funny?
Jake:  Oh, you know, just takin' this garbage bag of butter... [Grunts] ...into the house. [Chuckles again]
Finn:  Dude. That's not that funny. [Jake throws the garbage bag at Finn, splattering him with butter.] EAAH!!
Jake:  HAHAHAHAHA!
Finn:  Ohhh, butter pranked! I can't believe I didn't see that coming!
Jake:  Heh, yeah, I'm a genius.
Finn:  You have offended my honor, sir, and in so doing, you have awoken the pranking demon that sleeps in my pits! The demon is coming for you, mortal. It is going to prank you... so... HARD!
Jake:  Whatever. I'm gonna take a day long nap. [Yawns and walks towards the door]
Finn:  That's right, suckah! Go nap it up, for when you awake, the pranking demon will be upon you! [Jake shuts the door.] [To himself] Aww, man! Nothing's better than throwing a big bag of butter at someone! [Sighs] Gotta think! What's... a better prank... than butter?! Answer me, book! What's better than butter?! A unicorn. [Turns page] A treasure hunter! [Turns page] A battleship! [Turns page] A pie! [Turns page] A young girl in loWait! Book, rewind! [Turns back a page] That's it! I'll throw never-ending pies at Jake's face forever! [Laughs evilly]
Finn:  It's never-ending pie-throwing time! C'mon, dude! Turn on! [It doesn't respond.] Why isn't it working?! [Throws it] I'll never make a prank better than Jake's garbage bag full of butter. [Lightning strikes the machine]
Neptr:  Ouch!
Finn:  Holy stuff! It talked! Wow-cow-chow!
Neptr:  Greeting, creator!
Finn:  Oh, whoa! Hey, man!
Neptr:  My name is Neptr, which stands for "Never-Ending Pie-Throwing Robot."
Finn:  Oh, perfect! You're exactly the kind of robot I was trying to make!
Neptr:  Creator, I am eager to commence the creation and propulsion of pies forever, but my pie-hucking appendage is... malfunctioning, and my oven lamp is cold, and my tank treads do not roll! They only do skids! Why, creator?! [Finn gasps.] Does it please you to watch me struggle?!
Finn:  Neptr! Don't say stuff like that! Look, I know we just met, and you're probably goin' through a lot of personal stuff right now, but I really like you, Neptr, and I'm not gonna rest until you're working properly and throwing hot pie on my best friend's face. Together, we're gonna prank the poots out of Jake!
Neptr:  Haha! I'll always love you, creator!
Finn:  I know you will, Neptr. Now, all we need is more lightning power so you can be operating at full capacity! And I think I know just the dumb-hole who we can get some from.
Neptr:  Ooh, what beautiful piles of sugar!
Finn:  Heh. No, Neptr. We call that snow.
Neptr:  Snoooow??
Finn:  UNH! [Crashes into the Ice King's lair, and balloons float up] Did y'all smack me into that mountain on purpose?
Balloons:  Yeah!
Finn:  Take note, Neptr. These guys are grade-A pranksters. You guys hang out in case we need a daring escape!
One Balloon:  I got his wallet. [All the balloons laugh.]
Finn:  Just gotta sneak around until we find his lightning bolt stash.
Neptr:  But, creator, is not breaking and entering wrong?
Finn:  No, we're pranking and entering, which is awesome!
Neptr:  Sneaking! We're sneaking...
Finn:  [Whispering] Shush, Neptr!
Neptr:  Sneaking...
Finn:  Shh!
Neptr:  Sneaking...
Finn:  Neptr, you're gonna get us caught!
Neptr:  Sneaking!
Ice King:  Is that you, honey? [Finn runs away before he can see him.] How was your day at work? [Mock-female voice] Terrible! How could I possibly stand to be apart from you, the Ice King?! [Normal voice] You see, Gunter, that's how it would go if I actually had a wife.
Penguin:  Wenk.
Ice King:  Game time! [Activates Battle Babe.] Kill the frog! Kill the frog! C'mon! Oh, he's right in front of you! Lower! L[Scoffs] Stupid lady. Kill it...
Neptr:  Creator, if we get caught, I want you to know that I will always love you.
Finn:  Shh! You already told me that! And we're not getting caught! We're gonna get you working so you can prank Jake! He could wake up from his nap at any second!
Jake:  I might wake up at any moment! Naaaah, I'm still asleep.
Ice King:  No, no! That frog is casting magic missiles on my babe! [Frustrated noise]
Finn:  [Whispering to Neptr] Quickly! While he's distracted!
Ice King:  No, c'mon, get out of theUGH! Move!
Penguin:  Wenk!
Ice King:  Baaaugh! [Penguin waddles forward] This game cheats anyway! [Drops console, accidentally smashing it] LOOK WHAT YOU DID, GUNTER!!
Finn:  We're home free, Neptr.
Penguin:  Wenk wenk wenk wenk wenk wenk wenk!
Ice King:  What are you on about? You're starting to infuriate me... It's almost like you're trying to alert mewarn me about... I don't know, an intruder or something? Perhaps he's lurking in this very room, just outside my field of vision!
Penguin:  Wenk wenk wenk wenk.
Ice King:  Well, knock it off!!
Neptr:  What'll we do, creator?
Finn:  We're gonna prank 'im, Neptr. Hardcore.
Ice King:  [Looking at reflection] Hmm. You're looking kinda fat, Gunter! Look at these arms! Fat fat fat! Daddy's little fattie! Oh, you'll never get a prom date with all that chub on your face, you know! [An ice spike lands on Ice King] Ooh! Oh, blast these melty ceilings!
Finn:  Hee hee hee hee!
Neptr:  Creator, you have shown me the joys of pranking! I cannot wait to throw pies infinitely at Jake's face!
Finn:  The ceiling really is melty! [Falls] Whoa! Whoa! [Slides away with Neptr]
Ice King:  What was that?
Finn:  WAAAAH!
Ice Toads:  Alarm! Alarm! Alarm!
Finn:  Figs!
Ice King:  Huh? An intruder! Maybe a beautiful princess like in my poems.
Finn:  We've gotta find that lightning as fast as
Neptr:  Creator! Lightning!
Finn:  It's a lightning-shaped door! And we're gonna smash right into it! Hold on, Neptr! I got a plan!
Neptr:  That was a great plan!
Finn:  Nah, that wasn't my plan. We got lucky!
Neptr:  Are those my tickets to the gun show, creator?
Finn:  Mm-hmm. You're gonna be fully functional just like I promised.
Ice King:  Whoa, ice-o-pede! Finn?! Oh, why can't you ever be a princess?! Ice-o-pede, attack! [Ice-o-pede bites Ice King.] Ice-o-pede, no! Aaah!
Finn:  Let's grab some lightning and get outta here!
Ice King:  Hahaha! Finish him off, my semi-loyal pet! [The ice-o-pede fires at Finn and makes him drop Neptr.] An innocent bystander?! ZAP!
Finn:  Neptr! NOOOOO! [The ice magic reaches Neptr] NOOOOOO!Oh, yeah. That's what we wanted to happen.
Neptr:  Neptr is fully functional! Yay! [Laughs]
Finn:  Neptr! Yeah!
Ice King:  Crush him! Crush him like you crushed me!!
Neptr:  Creator?
Finn:  Neptr! The pies! Pies!
Neptr:  Oh, right!
Ice King:  Come on!
Finn:  What was in those pies?!
Neptr:  Just boysenberry. Hahaha. And also... poison.
Finn:  [Thinking] Neptr's acting... different.
Balloons:  Quick, Finn! Jump!
Finn:  Heh heh. You guys got me.
Ice King:  [To himself as the duo escapes] Something about that robot I tried to kill fills me with... deep longing.
Finn:  Thanks, guys. Your blood-oath is fulfilled.
Balloons:  Yay! To the mesosphere!
One Balloon:  Finally we can die!
Neptr:  I am troubled, creator. Troubled by a sudden urge to... collect princesses.
Finn:  Neptr, that's a heavy unsettling thing to say, but pull yourself together. We're about to prank Jake!
Neptr:  [Sad] Uh-huh. Sure.
Finn:  One... two...
Ice King:  [Opening door] THREE!
Finn:  Run, Neptr!!
Neptr:  Oooh!
Finn:  [Charging at Ice King] Hah! Hah! Hah! [Ice King freezes Finn.] Aw, man.
Ice King:  I've come to take my son.
Finn:  Your son?!
Ice King:  Come to Papi, son. I won't attack you... unless provoked.
Finn:  He's not your son! If anything, he's my son!
Ice King:  It was my power that activated his full potential. Zzz. [Makes a small lightening bolt]
Neptr:  Oooh...
Ice King:  When you were struck by my lightening, you also became infused with my private particles. He wants to be with me, Finn!
Finn:  No way! Neptr wants to help me prank Jake!
Neptr:  I am torn! I am processing a love for both princesses and pranking!
Ice King:  Don't worry, son. I'll show you the life you deserve! [Spins very quickly]
Finn:  No! Neptr!
Ice King:  Yes! Now that we've entered my imagination zone, allow me to tantalize you with this! [Snaps; princesses appear.] Princesses! As my son, you will carry on the tradition of capturing ladies!
Neptr:  Tell me more, Papi!
Finn:  No, Neptr!
Ice King:  I want a son who can do better than I. One who can succeed where I... have failed. You can mate with robot princesses!
Neptr:  Can I still prank with Finn after?
Ice King:  NO!! I'll show you what will happen if you hang out with Finn!
Imaginary Finn & Jake:  Yeah! Pootin' on Neptr to the max!
Neptr:  Haha! Yeah, I love Finn's pranks!
Ice King:  NOOOOO!! [The three exit the Imagination Zone.] I'm through playing around, son. Who do you choose?
Finn:  Come on, Neptr. Choose me, buddy. Choose pranks.
Neptr:  I... uh, I... choose... Ice King!
Finn:  WHAT?! You've gotta be flippin' kidding me!
Ice King:  He made his choice! Get over it, crybaby!
Neptr:  I'm not finished. I choose Ice King... to prank! Hardcore!
Ice King:  [Angry] WHHHAAAAT [Neptr launches a pie at Ice King.] Aah! My face! [Neptr and Finn laugh.] I birthed you and I can un-birth you!
Finn:  NEVER!
Ice King:  OOF! [Gets knocked out by Finn]
Neptr:  Sleep well, Papi. In your Imagination Zone full of beautiful princesses.
Finn:  You wanna prank Jake?
Neptr:  It's why I was created.
Finn:  Haha, okay. Let's gooooo! [Finn and Neptr go inside the Tree Fort.] Jake! Wake up!
Jake:  [Tired] Ahhh, hey, duAAAAAH!
Imaginary Neptr:  Sun is going down. Shall we capture princesses now, Papi?
Ice King:  No, let's just stay here a little longer, son.
Imaginary Neptr:  I love you forever, Papi.
