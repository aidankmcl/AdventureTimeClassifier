Nurse Pound Cake:  What's her condition, Dr. Ice Cream?
Dr. Ice Cream:  She's totally gross over 90% of her body. The other 10% is crazy nasty.
Nurse Pound Cake:  Will she make it, Doctor?
Dr. Ice Cream:  [Gravely] I don't know, Nurse Pound Cake. [They quickly pull her to the emergency room, a heart monitor bleeps.] Put sugar on 'er! Two scoops! [She and Nurse Pound Cake each put two handfuls of sugar on her, but she starts flat-lining.] We're losing 'er!!
Ice King:  No! Not my number one! Princess, if you die on me, I will never forgive you! I'll be lost--lost in my own emotional labyri--
Finn:  [Furiously punches him] YAAAAAH!!
Dr. Ice Cream:  Wait, Finn!
Finn:  [Scared] What!?
Dr. Ice Cream:  Her sugar levels are stabilizing.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Drained] Yes, I'm fine. I just need to rest.
Ice King:  [Crying] Oh, my wife! Is there anything weird about her? I can't see through these pain tears!
Dr. Ice Cream:  She's fine. Why?
Ice King:  It's just that... after Princess fell into the well, I saw something strange happen. Something I still don't understand. [Finn's Root Sword is hurled at Ice King.] Ooh--AGH! Wait! Listen to me!!
Finn:  NO! Just shut your face, old man!
Ice King:  "Old man?" Heh! What? I'm not old.
Jake:  Uh, yeah, you are, dude.
Ice King:  Old? I'm... I see. It's all making sense now. Brrrrapapo! [Blasts window with ice magic, shattering it] I'm going, Princess. I'm sorry if my skin grossed you out. Nobody wants to see this old skin, I guess. [Tearing up] Nobody in the world.
Finn:  [With rage] JUST GET OUT OF HERE!!
Ice King:  Peace.
Finn:  Sorry about that, Peebles.
Princess Bubblegum:  The ice wizard is a weak fool....
Jake:  Huh?
Raggedy Princess:  [Running in] Finn! Finn! The other princesses and I made you a new backpack!
Finn:  Whoa, Raggedy Princess! It's so awesome! Thank you.
Raggedy Princess:  [Blushes] You're welcome, Finn! [Giggles and runs off]
Jake:  [To Princess Bubblegum.] You look like sick, grey meat, but we're gonna jack you up so awesome.
Finn:  We should wheel 'er to her bedroom, right?
Jake:  Yeah, man, and then we'll do magic tricks.
Finn:  Like fake magic?
Jake:  Yeah, like [Jake's voice trails off as the screen turns black.] bruh bruh bruh, bruh...
Finn and Jake:  Princess... Princess... [Princess Bubblegum opens her eyes.] Surprise!
Finn:  We picked every flower in the Candy Kingdom just for you! [The flowers lie in the room, piling half-way up the wall in some places.]
Jake:  Whoo-oo!
Finn:  Princess Bubblegum?
Jake:  Oh, jeez!! [He hides behind Finn.] What's wrong with Princess Bubblegum?!
Finn:  [whispering] Quiet, dude. We're supposed to take care of her, not make her feel bad!
Jake:  I know, man, but she just seems... weird.
Finn:  She's just messed up from the accident, man. We just have to take care of her 'til she feels better.
Jake:  Uh... Okay, dude.
Finn:  Princess! Princess, no! You shouldn't be out of bed! [Finn picks her up and carries her back.] Princess... I... I gotta tell ya somethin'. Uh... Jake... [He nudges his head slightly to signal Jake to get out.]
Jake:  Oh. Gotcha. I'll go get some tea! [He cuts his way through the pile of flowers and exits.]
Finn:  Princess... this sweater you made me kept me safe. I almost got super messed up, but... it saved me. And I wanted to say... thank you for imbuing this sweater with the power of liking someone a lot. Because... I like you a lot. [Princess Bubblegum is looking at him.] [Finn blushes] Haha, uh... We shouldn't talk about this now. You should rest.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Weakly] Finn... I need you to get me some things...
Finn:  Yes, Princess.
Peppermint Butler:  [Entering with Jake] Princess! I brought you some tea--[He gasps, dropping the tea and sees Princess Bubblegum talking to Finn. He hisses like a cat.]
Jake:  Whoa... [Peppermint Butler runs away on all fours.] Uh... somethin' weird's goin' on...
Finn:  [approaches Jake from behind.] Jake!
Jake:  [Startled] AH!
Finn:  I'm gonna get some stuff for PB. Be right back.
Jake:  [Somewhat scared] Hey... Princess... Sorry you're not feelin' good. [She says nothing and looks at him annoyed (still breathing deeply).] Oh! I'll sing you a song! You love it when I sing songs!
Jake:  Uh... [Princess Bubblegum convulses and yells gibberish.] Uh, this song's not that good. It's a bad one. I... I'm stoppin'. [She yells again.] ...And starting a new song! [Plays bongos] [Princess Bubblegum yells in utter agitation. Her bed begins jumping up and down. Suddenly, demonic flames engulf the room.] AAH... [Princess Bubblegum touches him]
Princess Bubblegum:  [apparently melting.] Jake...
Jake:  AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!! [Flees room] OH, MY GLOB, OH, MY GLOB, OH, MY GLOB, OH, MY GLOB!! [To himself] Maybe the toxic waste did somethin' to her brain--made her have demon powers--or somethin'! [Finn runs towards the bedroom door with paraphernalia in his arms.] Yo, dude! Wait! What's all that biz?!
Finn:  Uh, bleach, lighter fluid, ammonia, gasoline, I dunno. Lady stuff. Plutonium...
Jake:  No, man... no... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Princess Bubblegum:  [Grabbing ingredients] Thanks. [Goes back in]
Finn:  No probs!
Jake:  Wait! Hold on!
Finn:  What's up?
Jake:  Listen... PB's bed was on fire.
Finn:  What?! Is she okay?!
Jake:  [Whispering] She made it on fire.
Finn:  With a match?
Jake:  No, man. With her brain... I think... [Finn stares confused.] Look, man, I'll show you!
Finn:  Jake, wh--
Jake:  Shh!! [Jake carefully opens the door. The room is burnt to a crisp, and Princess Bubblegum is gone.] P-P-P-Princess...?
Finn:  [Pointing to bathroom] Over there! [They go in front of the door. Finn knocks.] PB? You in there?
Princess Bubblegum:  [Threateningly] I'm busy!
Finn:  See? It's fine. She's just havin' private time.
Jake:  I'm lookin' in! [Looks through keyhole]
Finn:  JAKE, WHAT THE HEY?!
Jake:  Oh, my glob!
Finn:  [blushing.] Come on, man, that's pervy!
Jake:  You don't even know, man.
Finn:  DUDE?!
Jake:  Look! [Jake forces Finn to look through the keyhole.] See it!
Finn:  Hold on, Peebles! [He smashes down the door.] PRINCESS! [She grows bigger as she drinks the chemicals. She then picks up the whole bath tub and drinks deeply.] AAH! PUT DOWN THE TUB!
Gumball Guardian:  Evil presence detected!! [Grapples with monster Princess Bubblegum] Must defend!!
Ice King:  [poking Finn's face.] Hey, Finn, are you dead or what?
Finn:  [Waking up] Whaaah?... Ice King? What are you doing here?
Ice King:  Hey. I had to keep an eye on the princess because she's being possessed by the Lich.
Finn:  [Grunts] You don't know that.
Ice King:  But I do. I saw it with my wizard eyes! [Scene changes to the well.] In the well, I saw something come out of the Lich and go into the princess. But I wasn't sure it was real [scene returns to normal.] because when you have stanky old wizard eyes, sometimes you see things that are real, and other times it's like crazy crazy crazy in your face all the time! [Strange creatures dance around Finn and Jake in the Ice King's vision. He sighs] [To himself] All the time... [To the duo] Guys, let me help you. I don't want my future wife to be... physically unattractive.
Finn:  Listen, you old poot. I'm not going to let you kill 'er twice. GET STUFFED. Come on, Jake.
Finn:  We're coming, Princess!
Jake:  Dude! I think we should let the Ice King help! He can freeze her, which could buy us some t--
Finn:  Dump that mess! I'mma set 'er free with my like-like sweater!
Jake:  Woooh, do it! [Propels Finn towards her with his hind end.]
Finn:  [while hurtling through the air.]I like you, Princess!!
Jake:  Finn!!
Finn:  Urrgh... [To himself] Liking her... didn't work. She's unstoppable... unless... [He sees her stomping on Jake's head and sighs.] [Reluctantly] Ice King, I... I need you to freeze Princess Bubblegum. Will you help me?
Ice King:  [Gasps] Are you suuuuure?
Finn:  [Annoyed] Yes.
Ice King:  Great! Weeee! [Laughs and grabs Finn before exiting]
Finn:  I'll distract 'er up top, you freeze 'er legs!
Ice King:  [Throwing Finn] Wah!
Finn:  I'M A CAT! I'M AN AGILE CAT! JAKE! DUCK! [Jake retracts his body and falls to the ground. Finn grabs Princess Bubblegum's hair and covers her face with it.] MEOW, ICE KING! [Ice King grunts as he freezes the monstrosity with visible difficulty. A bird brings Finn down to the ground before he's frozen.] Thanks, bird!
Ice King:  Yeah! Whoopie!
Finn:  You did good, Ice King.
Ice King:  Oh, yeah?
Finn:  Yeah, man.
Ice King:  Okay. I didn't kill 'er this time. Everybody saw that, right?
Gumball Guardian:  [shattered.] Duuuude...
Finn:  We gotta get 'er to the hospital!
Dr. Ice Cream:  Start assembling! Here, try to connect these two pieces! [The pieces don't connect.] Turn it... [The wads of gum stick.] Perfect. [The wad of gum is put on Princess Bubblegum's head to make a piece of her hair.] Give me more pieces, Doctor Princess!
Dr. Princess:  That's all we have, Dr. Ice Cream!
Dr. Ice Cream:  What?! That can't be!
Nurse Pound Cake:  [Gasps] What do we do, Doctor?
Dr. Ice Cream:  [sighing] ...I don't know, Nurse Pound Cake.
Finn:  I hope she's okay...
Nurse Pound Cake:  Attention, everyone...
Finn:  [In desperation] IS PB OKAY?!?
Nurse Pound Cake:  Yes... but there were some complications.
Finn:  NOOOOOOO!!!!
Nurse Pound Cake:  Yes... I'm afraid... there wasn't enough gum to work with, so it appears Princess Bubblegum is now...... younger. [A young Princess Bubblegum steps out of the emergency room. Everyone gasps, astonished.] She's 13 years old now.
Ice King:  Aw, dang it! Well, I'm outta here. Goodbye, everyone. [Exits]
Finn:  13 years old? That's how old I am. [Princess Bubblegum smiles at Finn. He blushes.] Uh...
Jake:  [Amused] Whoa...
Princess Bubblegum:  [Embracing him] Give me a hug, hero.
