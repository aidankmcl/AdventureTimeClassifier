Cuber:  [Turning to the viewer] Hmm? [Laughing] Oh, greeble bayble grapes. You're just in time. Bayble Cuber's going to watch an inkle dribble adventure from days of old on my holo-pyramid viewer. Five stories each relating to one special theme. See if you graybles can guess the theme by the end of the episode, okay? Now sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.
Finn:  Okay, BMO, [we'll] be back in an hour. You sure you don't need anything from the Grocery Kingdom?
BMO:  No, I don't need anything. Thank you. Okay, goodbye, Finn and Jake!
Finn:  Bye, BMO!
Jake:  Yeah, see ya later, BMO!
BMO:  Finn? Jake? [Talking to reflection] Well, hello there. Oh, hello! Who are you? My name is Football. What's yours? I am BMO. [Beat] BMO, are you a robot? [Gasps] Oh, no, Football! I am a little living boy! Oh! That sounds wonderful, BMO! Will you teach me about being alive? Yes, Football! Watch me! [BMO pretends to brush its teeth and "Football" gasps. BMO smacks its face with soap and "Football" gasps again. BMO then grabs a glass of water and sits on the toilet to pour water in. "Football" gasps.] Pee-ing! Oh, BMO, that's fantastic! [Camera turns to reveal that Finn and Jake are watching BMO through the window.] Oh, thank you, Football! It's really nothing. [BMO continues talking.]
Jake:  What the...?
Finn:  See, man? I told you.
Jake:  This is nuts. Plus, he's usin' my toothbrush!
Finn:  No, man. That's my toothbrush. [Beat; the two look at each other]
Finn & Jake:  [In disgust] UGH!
Finn:  [Reading to-do list] "Prove that BMO does weird junk when nobody is around." Check! [Checks item off list]
Jake:  High-five, buddy!
Finn:  That was pretty weak.
Jake:  Yeah. I was thinkin' the same thing.
Finn:  You wanna give it another go?
Jake:  Yeah.
Finn:  That was better... but we can do better.
Jake:  You mean even better.
Finn:  Let's back on up and run at each other!
Jake:  Okay!
Finn & Jake:  [Voices crescendoing] Aaaaaahhhh.... [Their hands meet thunderously.] ZAH!!
Jake:  Ooh, kinda stings!
Finn:  I like the pain.
Jake:  Let's do another one.

Princess Bubblegum:  Ugh...
Peppermint Butler:  A glass of delicious, nourishing water for my lady [Princess Bubblegum knocks the water away] AAH!! [Exits]
Princess Bubblegum:  [Frustrated sigh; she stares at her paper and gasps.] Oh, yes!
Cow:  Oh, man... Uh... oh, boy... [The machine activates and spins faster and faster as the cow screams louder and louder. The centrifuge powers down.] Ugh... Oh, my Glob! Oh, Glob...
Princess Bubblegum:  Cheeeeese...

Princess Bubblegum:  Ha ha! Jingo-jango!
Princess Bubblegum:  Yeast on third, flour on first, swell the dough, fit to burst! Awhoooooo!
Princess Bubblegum:  [Exhausted] Well... this is it, Cinnamon Bun. The most perfect sandwich that has ever existed, or ever will exist within the confines of space-time. Will you do the honors?
Cinnamon Bun:  Okay. [He takes the sandwich and places it directly into his stomach.]
Princess Bubblegum:  [Flabbergasted] But... but you... you didn't... y-y-you didn't even... taste it...
Cinnamon Bun:  Thanks, Princess. Peace out.
Ice King:  Blegh, Gunter, something stinks! [Sniffs penguin] Gunter, do you smell that? [Penguin continues playing] GUNTER, STOP PLAYING THE KEYBOARD!! [Notices something and sniffs around] Smells like it's comin' from... [Sniffs penguin] Gunter, are you blowin' it up in here? [The penguin just stares] You are nasty, Gunter! You got a nasty booty, mister! Nasty! [The penguin looks down in shame.] Oh, don't be sad, stinky. Come with daddy and I'll make it aaaall better.
Ice King:  Goodbye, Gunter. Sorry, sweetie, but I'm never gonna get any princesses if you're stinkin' up the place! [Goes back inside and sniffs] Blaaaah, it still stinks in here! What the heck! Where's that smell comin' from?! [Sniffs armpit] Oh, it's me. I smell horrible.
Ice King:  Scrub, penguins! Scrub harder! We are not stopping until the stench is completely gone!
Ice King:  [Whistling] Clean clean, clean ka-clean. [Whistles some more; suddenly the penguin from earlier is seen and is dripping wet.] Gunter! Guess what? It was me who was smelly, not you!
Penguin:  [Angry] Wenk.
Ice King:  Sorry. I thought you had a stank booty, Gunter. My bad. Although I have no idea how my armpits got so stinky.

Candy Magician:  You're totally gonna win, LSP.
Peppermint Butler:  Thank you, Marc. You made two out of ten baskets.

Cuber:  [To audience] Oh, bayble, that was easy, wasn't it? Slimmin'? I'm glad we all guessed the theme so easily. What? You haven't guessed it? Oh. I'm sorry. Well, pause your viewer now to think about it before I belayble it to you. [The scene pauses momentarily.] The theme was the five senses! You see? Look. BMO saw his reflection. Finn and Jake touched their hands together! The Princess made a tasty sandwich! The blue guy smelled bad! And the other thing heard music. Oh, what a treat! Okay, well I'll see you trimpy flimmers on triode flimpin' the diode!
