Finn:  Man, why am I so sleepy?
Jake:  [getting a banana] Dude, we've been up for like seven days.
Finn:  [breathing] For real-sies?
Jake:  Yeah, for real-sies! [Flashback begins.] Remember? First, we rescued the Slime Princess from the Ghost Ship Vortex. And then we slayed that fire dragon. And that took a couple of days.
Finn:  Then we went to LSP's quinceanera.
Lumpy Space Princess:  Oh, no way. You guys made it!
Jake [Voice-over]:  Helped Peppermint Butler with his Goblin problem.
Peppermint Butler:  I swear that I found it like this. I don't know what happened.
Finn:  We'll take care of it, Peppermint Butler.
Finn [Voice-over]:  We rescued Wildberry Princess from the Ice King.
Ice King:  I just wanna be happy!
Jake:  Then, we captured that Bandito.
Sheriff :  Thanks, you guys.
Jake:  Saved the house...
Man:  Thanks, you guys.
Jake:  And fed that duck.
Jake:  We've had a busy week.
Finn:  I'm exhausted. But happy!
Jake:  Good night, buddy.
Finn:  Good night! [to himself] That's right, Finn. Adventure 'til you drop. [Yawns. Closes his eyes, but starts to move around and grunt] Hey, Jake?
Jake:  Yeah?
Finn:  Can you sleep?
Jake:  No.
Finn:  I can't sleep either.
Jake:  Yeah, what's going on with that?
Finn:  I don't know. But, I've got the strangest feeling...that we're being watched.
Finn:  Why is that horse staring at us?
Finn:  That's super creepy.
Jake:  Man, I just wanna go to sleep.
Finn:  Well, maybe he's gone.
Jake:  Not gonna be able to sleep with that horse watchin' me.
Finn:  Let's just close the shade.
Jake: Outta sight and outta mind.
Finn:  Good work, Jake
Jake:  See 'ya in the morning, pal.
Finn:  Ahh! Why won't it stop?!
Jake:  All right, man. Let's just go...push it off that hill or something.
Finn:  Maybe we can just...politely ask it to leave.
Jake:  Hey! Get out of here, horse! I want to go to sleep, and you're creeping me the math out!
Finn:  Whoa, man! Let me try, diplomat style. [walks over to the horse] Pardon me horse, I beseech thou to split from mine land, this night. But I welcome thee to come back for some luncheth, some other day. Okay?
Jake:  Forget it, man. This horse is whack. It's got poo-brain.
Finn:  [Sighs] Okay, you're right. We can try pushing it, now.
Finn:  Move, horsey! Good Grod, Jake! Are you even pulling?!
Jake:  I'm super-pulling!
Finn:  This horse has a ridiculous weight!
Finn:  Math this. What now, man.
Jake:  I didn't wanna have to use my powers on you, horse, because I'm so sleepy. But you've pushed Jake too far!
Giant Jake:  RAAAAHH! AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!
Finn:  You shouldn't creep us out from way over there!
Jake:  Let's get back to bed, buddy.
Finn:  Oh yeah, I'm so ready for bed.
Jake:  I wanna marry my bed.
Finn:  Me too!
Jake:  No more.... NO MORE!
Finn:  Where are you going?!
Jake:  I have an idea! [runs up to the horse, and flakes a blindfold on his face] I did it! Ha-ha! He can't stare at us if he's blind!
Finn:  Look, man. [points behind Jake]
Jake:  Wh..why?! Stupid blindfold! What's your deal, screwy?! Why are you messin' with us, huh?!
Finn:  Jake! That horse is whack with poo-brain.
Jake:  Yeah, I know, Finn. I diagnosed this horse with whacked out poo-brain five minutes ago.
Finn:  Dude, poo-brain means we can lure it away from here using music. [Meteor then appears on-screen] Everything brainless likes music.
Jake:  That's true! You're a genius! [goes to get his viola] All right horse, prepare to be lured! [walks off and plays Beethoven's, "Moonlight Sonata"] Follow me, Horsey.
Finn:  Jake? It's not luring!
Jake:  Huh! Hmmm. [plays Symphony No. 5 in C minor] So, Beethoven's not luring enough for you, is it? Well, how about some Mozart?! [plays Mozart's "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik"]
Finn:  Huh?!
Finn:  Ha! [closes his eyes]
Finn:  Stop! You're luring snakes! STOP!!
Jake:  Huh? Oh, nuts. Let me try and lure a mongoose! [starts playing, "Ride of the Valkyries"; Finn throws Jake's viola aside]
Finn:  Stop man!
Jake:  No! Ahh! [sighs] Dude... let's kill the horse.
Finn:  What?!
Jake:  I'm so tired, Finn!
Finn:  No, man, we're not killing the horse.
Jake:  Okay, we won't kill the horse. We'll dress him up like a bunny! Ha-ha! And get a giant hawkCaaaww!--To kill him!
Finn:  Wah?!
Jake:  Caaawww! Caaawwwwww!
Finn:  No, man! That is wrong.
Jake:  Eh. Did I say that the hawk would kill him? I meant that the hawk would swoop down gently and take him away to an island of sunshine and love-stuff and, take care of him.
Finn:  Whoa. That sounds awesome.
Jake:  What do think?
Finn:  It looks like a bunny?
Both:  Hey Come and get it hawk, let's go!
Finn:  Hey Jake, I think I see a hawk or two. [sees hawks] Cause more commotion to help the hawks!
Both:  Ahhh! Blblblblblblblblblbl! [continue to scream like crazy] Take the bunny!
Finn:  Hey, there they are! They see our commotions!
Both:  Riiiiiighhhhhht here! Yeah!
Jake:  Grab a good hold and fly away!
Finn:  The bunny! The bunny!
Finn:  What a beautiful sight.
Both:  We did it! Back to sleep!
Both:  [run away laughing and screaming]
Finn:  Good night, buddy.
Jake:  Good night, buddy.
Finn:  Ahh! It's in our house now!
Jake:  That's obvious, Finn! You don't have to say that out loud!
Finn:  Hey, this is all your fault, dude! If you weren't so darn handsome, animals wouldn't always be staring at you!
Jake:  You're just mad at me for being...handsome? Well, you're the one who told me to lure snakes! Ahhh!
Finn:  I told you to lure the horse! You lured the snakes! There's even one here in my underpants! [sighs] Wait a minute, dude. Can't you see what this horse is doing? [long silence] It's tearing us apart.
Jake:  Aw, man.. you're right! We have to get rid of this horse, for us!
Finn:  I know, bro. I know. [The two hug]
Jake:  Oh, Finn; this horse is bringing us together now. This horse is a blessing.
Finn:  What?! Dude, you've lost it!
Jake:  You...wait, wait. [crying] The horse is tearing us apart again!
Finn:  You're right! It's about time I show this horse who's the man.
Jake:  What are you going to do?
Finn:  Say that to me again.
Jake:  What are you going to do?!
Finn:  Do... Doo-doo. I'm going to kick that horse in the bottom!
Jake:  Oh, my Grod!
Finn and Jake:  The Ice King?!
Ice King:  I should go.
Finn:  You were spying on us?!
Ice King:  That's none of your business!
Jake:  He was trying to learn our bedtime secrets!
Finn:  [gasps] Were you?
Jake:  [gasps] He was! Did you find out that I sleep "in the nude"?
Jake:  It's none of your business how nude I sleep, Ice King! Nnnnone of your business!
Ice King:  Gentlemen, I'll see you later.
Both:  Hmph!
Jake:  Here's your sword, dude!
Finn:  Thank you.
Finn:  Jake! Jake! Look out!
Jake:  Tell us why you were spying!
Ice King:  NO!
Finn:  Snakes!
Jake:  Quick! Throw them to the Ice King!
Finn:  What's he doing?
Jake:  He's using his ice powers.
Finn and Jake:  Ow! Ouch! Ow! Hey! Hey!
Ice King:  Is that all the ice ya have?
Finn:  Yeeesss!
Ice King:  Well, you should really have more.
Finn:  We don't need any more.
Ice King:  What if you had guests?
Finn:  Guests bring their own ice.
Finn:  Tell us why you're watchin' us or we'll - we'll cut off your stupid head.
Jake:  Yeah and make it quick 'cause we're both really sleepy.
Ice King:  Ok, ok, I'll tell you! I was watching you... to learn how to be happy.
Finn:  What?
Jake:  Huh?
Ice King:  It's true! I would like to be happy like you guys. But, I have no idea how.
Jake:  So, you dressed up like a horse?
Ice King:  Have pity on me. [flashback begins] I've been so sad and miserable, I cry all the time. But, whenever I see you two, you always look so happy.
Ice King [In flashback]:  But, they're just hopping over each other.
Ice King [Voice-over]:  So yes, I've decided to spy on you, dressed as a horse. [shows the Ice King getting dressed up, aided by the penguins.]
Ice King:  But, I guess my plan failed. All I observed was you two arguing over...how to get rid of me.
Ice King:  Hey, are you sleeping? [gasp] Is this it? Sleeping? Could it be that all I need is a good night's rest? [closes his eyes.]
Ice King:  Ahh... I'm... still not happy.
