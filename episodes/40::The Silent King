Finn:  The Goblins have suffered long enough, Xergiok!
Xergiok:  Shush! You guys can't live without me, right? [kicks Goblins and slaps their heads]
Goblins:  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Jake:  You got problems, man.
Xergiok:  Blah! [He hurls a fireball at them and destroys the table; Finn and Jake evade the fireball]
Finn:  [Deflects a fireball with his sword] Wands are for wimps! [punches Xergiok outside]
Xergiok:  You may have beaten me this time, but[Jake throws a rock at Xergiok] Ogh!
Finn & Jake:  Haha! Yeah!
Xergiok:  [Uses spell to disappear]
Finn:  And stay out, Muffin Top!
Goblins:  Finn and Jake! Finn and Jake! Finn and Jake!
Gummy:  Nyaaar! Great job, warriors! You've freed us. I am Gummy, royal goblin chief of staff.
Finn:  Nice to meet you. [rubs Gummy's head]
Gummy:  Nyaan! I'm sorry. I have not known a friendly touch in some time. You see, Xergiok loved to be a jerk to us...
Xergiok:  It's spanking time!!! Hiyahhh! Yeah!
Xergiok:  [Enjoying Sunset] Sigh. [Spanks Goblin] Yahhh!
Goblin:  Ow! Ow!
Goblin:  Ah, heck, Maria, I need to ask you something, [Pulls out ring] Do you want to do this marriage thing with me?
Goblins:  Awwww! [Goblin in the background:] Isn't that sweet?
Maria:  Oh, my love, the answer is yes.
Xergiok:  [Kicks ring, spanks the Goblin repeatedly] Boom! Hahaha! [To Maria] Congratulations.
Maria:  Oh!!!
Xergiok:  HA HA HA.
Gummy:  We need a good king to rule us, like you mayhaps?
Goblins:  Yeah, yeah! [Background: "You should do it!"]
Jake:  Yeah, be their king.
Finn:  No, man, I'm an adventurer for life.
Goblin with Cane:  If there isn't a king to not tell me to not start a riot, I could start a riot, then!
Goblin:  No rules, baby! Start that riot!
Goblins:  Whoo! Yeah! [Starts riot ]
Goblin:  Flip this table!
Goblin with Hammer:  No one can tell me no! [Hammers own hand] Aah!
Gummy:  Please, Finn, [puppy eyes] we need a king.
Finn:  Stop the riot!
Goblins:  Huh?
Finn:  I'll become your king! To save y'all, from yourselves.
Gummy:  [Stands up] We have a new king!
Goblins:  Woohoo! Yeah!
Goblin:  [Puts crown on Finn's head]
Jake:  Finn's gonna need a queen... I'll do it.
Goblins:  [continuing cheering]
Gummy:  Allow me to show you the grounds, Your Majesties.
Jake:  Show me what we got, Gummy. Show it to me! [stretches head across body] Dude! I'm psyched!
Finn:  Hahaha, yeah!
Gummy:  The Goblin Birthing Pits, Your Majesties.
Goblin in the Pit:  I'm being... born.
Finn:  That's pretty neat.
Gummy:  The Garden of Living Fountains.
Finn & Jake:  Whoo! Awesome.
Gummy:  The Royal Game Archive, complete with controller hats.
Finn & Jake:  [Wearing controller hats] Ooooh.
Gummy:  The Royal Dragon Stables.
Finn:  [thinks about riding a dragon and saying, Ohhhhh! Hahaha!] Whoa!
Gummy:  And finally, the royal bedroom, with king-sized bed for the royal couple.
Jake:  Can you make that a bunk bed?
Gummy:  Yes, my queen. Whisper Dan. [Claps]
Whisper Dan:  [Cranks a wheel, which in turn cuts the bed in half with a giant knife. Some hands spring out of the wall to hold the top half above the bottom half.]
Jake:  I call top. [jumps on top]
Finn:  And I call...
Gummy:  Wait! For you, great king, the Book of Royal Rules. [holding a book with lots of pages]
Finn:  Hmmm. Sounds boring.
Gummy:  Oh, no worries, my Liege. I'll read it to you.
Finn:  Hey, Jake, want to stay awake and hear some rules?
Jake:  [Immediately falls asleep. A lion and a goose sleep with him.]
Finn:  Alright, lay it on me, Gummy.
Gummy:  Introduction, colon, the 623 royal rules were established in moon year 16, in response to Elder Gorflox's repeated requests for an organized... [Finn falls asleep and two black and white tigers cover him as blankets] Awaken, Your Highness!
Jake:  No way, dude. [rolls over and farts, waking the lion]
Gummy:  Your Excellency! Let's go. We have much to do! 
Finn:  Whoo!!
Gummy:  [Leads Finn to another room] This is where you may perform your daily processes, my king [opens the door]
Finn:  Whoooaa!!!! Look at that huge mirror... and it's painted baby blueboy style.
Gummy:  Come, sire, it is time to brush your teeth in the front of the "boy style" mirror. [clapping]
Finn:  Whooo!!! Awesome! [takes the toothbrush]
Goblins around the sink:  [gasp] Oh, no, no, no, Your Majesty! Let us brush your teeth
Finn:  [Does a back flip] Yaaaah!! Whoa, ease up, dudes. Finn access only.
One goblin around the sink:  Aaaah, he's a rule breaker! Don't spank us too hard. [bend over so Finn can spank them]
Gummy:  Spare them, Your Majesty! Spank me instead! [bends over] Set my buttocks ablaze!
Finn:  Guys, what are you talking about?
Gummy:  Rule 1: The king shall not brush his own teeth... in the book of royal rules I read to you last night.
Finn:  Oh! Oh. Guys, put your hams away.
All three goblins:  Whaa??
Finn:  I'm not gonna spank your hams. I'm not that kind of king!
Gummy:  So then... we may brush your teeth, my lord?
Finn:  You can brush my teeth... I guess.
All 3 goblins:  Yaayyyy!!!!!! [Put 3 toothbrushes in his mouth and cuts to another scene]
Finn:  This brunch looks great! Can't wait to dig in. [about to cut it]
Gummy:  Uhhh, I will cut that, Your Highness.
Finn:  Gummy, as king, I order you to let me cut it.
Gummy:  I'm sorry, sire. The royal rules don't allow it.
Finn:  I'm cutting it, Gummy! [about to cut it]
Gummy:  No! [takes them away and cuts it]
Finn:  [annoyed] Thank you, Gummy.
Gummy:  Uhhhhh, a thousand pardons, my lord. You're not going to chew that, are you?
Finn:  Yeah.
Gummy:  I'm sorry, sire. The royal rules don't allow it.
Finn:  Gummy, just let me do this. No one will know.
Gummy:  I would know. [takes it off his fork, chews it up, and spits it out on Finn's plate]
Finn:  Uhhhhhh, Jake, this is nuts.
Jake:  Maybe, but rules are rules. [a goblin spits stuff out on Jake's plate]
Gummy:  Master, eat your food. I chewed thoroughly and heated it to goblin body temperature.
Finn:  I'm not hungry, Gummy.
Gummy:  You look a little bit down. Would you like me to weep for you?
Finn:  No, Gummy. It's just.... [the door burst open a goblin came in]
Goblin:  Sire, sire!!!! There's trouble in town square. A thief!!
Finn:  A thief? Hahaha, yes! I'll handle it! [takes out his sword]
Gummy:  No, sire! The king is not allowed to fight. He must give a speech to the thief. That is the royal rule, my Liege. [Finn frowns and they go out on a balcony] There's the thief! [a guy trying to take a basket from an old lady goblin]
Thief:  Give me them hot buns, lady!
Finn:  Hey, thief!
A goblin:  It's the new king. It's him! [everyone looks at him]
Finn:  I got a speech for you
Gummy:  Nooooooo! [covers Finns mouth] The Royal Speaker must give the speech.
Finn:  What.
Gummy:  Ya see? [the royal speaker comes out on a balcony above them]
Royal Speech-taker:  [Clears throat] Since the dawn of time, the balance of what is right and what is wrong has...
Thief:  [looks back at old lady goblin and tries to get it again] Ha ha ha, I'll take this.
Gummy:  Yes, you can feel it slowly working, eh?
Finn:  [starts to get mad and takes out his sword] I can't let this go on. [jumps off and gets the basket] Hands off, thief!!
Thief:  [gasps and backs away]
Finn:  Ha!! Here you go, old lady. [gives her the basket]
Old lady:  Oh, no, the new king! Just as cruel as the last king.
Finn:  Iyouwhat?
Another goblin:  Oh, king, we beg you not to slay the old lady. [Finn turns around] Aaaah!!! [goblins murmur in fear]
Finn:  No, wait.
Old lady:  Don't slay me! You may keep the hot buns, Your Majesty! [on the ground]
Another goblin:  I'm ready for my spanking, Mr. Xergiok part two.
Rest of group:  We're ready [bending over for their spanking] for our spankings, sire.
Finn:  [sighs] I just want to help y'all as much as I can, and y'all just keep showing me your goblin hams. [rides on a goblin] When I became king, I didn't think y'all would show me your rears, but I'll accept my boring fate, and shed this tear... [wipes off tear] 'cause I can't seem to cure you of your groundless fears.
Gummy:  No. No more spankings... [Finn enters] Aaaahh!!!!
Finn:  Gummy, don't be afraid. I'm gonna stick to the rules now, okay?
Gummy:  My lord, I'm sorry, y-you haven't heard? Xergiok is returning with an evil army. Come look through the scope! [Finn gets off the goblin he was riding] You see? [he sees an army of Earclopses led by Xergiok]
Xergiok:  Prepare to destroy them all!
Gummy:  [passes out] Ohhh...
Finn:  [looks through the telescope and gasps] If I defeat Xergiok as king, I can prove to the goblins that an active king can be a good king, but I can't let them know until it's all over. Stay fainted, Gummy. [goes out door] Ooooooooh! Whisper Dan, have you seen Jake?
Whisper Dan:  [cranks a wheel, opening a hatch]
Jake:  I'm in here.
Finn:  Xergiok's back with an army of Earclopses. Let's bust them up.
Jake:  pbbbbbbbbbbbbb. All right, man, how do we do this?
Finn:  Hmmmmmmm. [looks at Whisper Dan]
Jake:  What if they figure it out?
Finn:  No way, man.
Gummy:  I'm going to be honest with you, king Finn. When I'm scared, I feel most safe in your lap.
Xergiok:  Line up for you spankings, goblins! [the goblins get scared]
One goblin:  Ohhhhh, too latein my pants.
Finn:  Jake, the goblins can't see me being unkingly. I need a disguise.
Jake:  Jump in my mouth. [Finn does so and Jake makes Jakesuit]
Xergiok:  Who among you has the courage to face Xergiok?
Finn:  Shut your kissin' hole, Xergiok! It's time for a beatin'.
Xergiok:  I salute you, foolish warrior! You can be my personal sla[Finn in Jakesuit claps in the Earclops' ear, and the Earclops lands on Xergiok. Finn claps in more Earclopses' ears, causing them to fall.]
Finn:  [into megaphone] wowowowowowowowowoowowoow! [the other Earclopses fall down from the loud sound]
Xergiok:  How in the world? [Jakesuit gets in front of Xergiok]
Finn: Dude, no one uses Earclopses in a battle without earplugs.
Xergiok:  [does vanishing spell and appears above them] Eat this! [Throws a fireball at them. Finn hits it away with his sword, which hits a rock. Xergiok shoots three more fireballs; two miss, but one Finn hits with his sword, which almost hits Xergiok] Whoa! [teleports in front of them] Ha ha, you missed me [the fireball hits him; he drops his wand, which Finn picks up and eats]
Goblins:  [cheering] [they pick up Finn and Jake and take them into the castle]
Gummy:  Oh, great king, with the help of a brave soldier, you thwarted the evil Xergiok. [a goblin raises Whisper Dan's hand]
Goblins:  Hurrah!!! [the goblin raises and lowers Whisper Dan's arm]
Finn:  C'mon, dude, lets get out of here.
Jake:  [sighs] Alright. [they walk home]
Finn:  Well, looks like they got the king they wanted, buddy.
Jake:  Yep.
Finn:  And we're going home to adventure.
Jake:  Mmhmm.
Finn:  High five us, dude. [Finn does one hand and Jake does the other hand and they clap together] Hey, Jake?
Jake:  Wha?
Finn:  Why do the insides of you smell like vanilla?
Jake:  Ohh, uh, a wizard put a curse on me.
Finn:  Huh, neat.
