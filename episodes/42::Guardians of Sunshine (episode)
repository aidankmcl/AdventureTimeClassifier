Finn: Haha! Time to protect the sun!
Jake: Ha ha! Yeah, he knows how to get things started.
Finn: Firepit number 1. Easy-peasy, livin' greasy! You wonder why they even put it there.
Jake: It's probably a computel gleetch.
Finn: [laughs]
Jake: Now comes some real trouble! It's Bouncy Bee! He's gonna get that sun, man!
Finn: Haha! Please. [destroys Bouncy Bee on video game] Bleep!
Jake: [chuckles]
Finn: I had my eyes closed on that one!
Jake: Yeah, that was cool. Oh, oh, you missed a coin, dude, go back!
Finn: I ain't in it for the money, man. I'm in it to crush the enemies of the sun. Like this sloppy butt right here.
Jake: Hunny Bunny!
Finn: I'm like, Hunny Bunny, don't you ever learn? I've always got the bomba! [destroys Hunny Bunny on video game]
Jake: Man, you are hot tonight! Think you can do it this time? Can you beat Sleepy Sam?!
Finn: Oh, I very can!
Jake: Remember: use a combo move!
Finn: Okay! Here goes.
Finn and Jake together: Up, down, left, left, right, right, down-
Jake: Spin, down, up, left, faster, dude! Right, left, down!
Finn: Aww! Every time! [throws controller] BMO, this game is the worst! If we were really inside that game, man, we would crush Sleepy Sam. Breezily! With my mitts!
BMO: Oh no! It's much more dangerous than you think!
Finn: Whoa, whoa, wait!
Jake: BMO, is there a way for us to get in the game for real?
BMO: Yes, of course, Jake. [opens compartment on self] If I push this button-
BMO: If I push this button, you will both be dangerously transported into my main brain game frame where it is very dangerous!
Finn: Oh, man. Oh, BMO! You gotta let us in that game!
BMO: No! It's a far too dangerous incredible adventure for you! It's final.
Finn: Oh. Okay, BMO. Well, time for bed!
Jake: ...Finn?
Finn: Time for bed. Right, Jake? [Finn gives Jake a look that signifies that he has a plan.]
Jake: ...oh, right! Heh heh. Good night, BMO. [BMO looks at them suspiciously] Time for bed! [Jake chuckles evilly]
Finn: We're in the game!
Jake: Look! There's the sunshine we gotta protect! [points to the sun in the video game] And there's a hole we're supposed to go down! [points to a cave] And there's you...doing whatever you're doing. [points to Finn]
Finn:  I'm looking at my bits! My leg is math!
Jake:  Mmm. That sunshine feels good. Feels good all over!
Finn:  No wonder all the monsters in this game want to get their grubby mitts on it! Let's go kick their digital bootays! [8-bit sounds play] Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo doo! Doo!
Jake:  [laughs] Beep boop! Beep boop!
Finn:   We are in the computer world. We're computer boys, not computer girls. 
Jake:   In a game, I can be who I virtually am. 
Finn:   I can walk and sing, I can kill Silly Sam! 
Jake:  [sniffs] Hey, what stinks? [sniffs] Smells like...
Finn:  Pit! [camera shows the pit's width] Looks a mite bigger inside the game...
Jake:  Jumpin' over this pit is easy, remember? We could do this backwards with our eyes closed! [jumps backwards with eyes closed and falls into pit] Ahh! It's burning!
Finn:  Jake!!
Jake:  Haha. What, man?
Finn:  Whaa?! Jake, what the shake?
Jake:  Check it out! Extra lives!
Finn:  You still have two left!
Jake:  [laughs and jumps into lava pit] Ow! It burns! Ow! Haha!
Finn:  Jake!
Jake:  [sings along with jingle]
Finn:  Dude! What if losing all your lives in here makes you die in real life? Or worse?!
Jake:  ...that makes me just want to sit here and feel bad.
Finn:  No way, man! We're gonna cross that hole! With real-world grit! Come on!
Finn:  Faster, Jake! Get ready to stretch it!
Finn:  Watch out, Jake! [Jake stretches around the flame. They land on the other side, but not before Jake gets burned on his backside.]
Jake:  Ow! Whew! That was pretty intense, dude!
Finn:  We're pretty intense dudes!
Jake:  Yeah! [High-fives Finn]
Finn:  Ha!
Jake:  What's that sound?
Finn:  Sounds like... [both turn around]
Finn and Jake:  Bouncy Bee!
Jake:  Whoa!
Finn:  Hi-yah! [Hand slices through air] Oh! [Kicks air.]
Finn:  You ready to flippin' this guy up, Jake?
Jake:  Easy-peasy, livin' greasy!
Jake:  No! [Jake gasps and runs away from Bouncy Bee.]
Jake:  Finn's dead! Finn! No! [Jake slows down.] Why? [Jake stops completely] NO!!! Curse this false virtual world! [Jake throws a rock as the computer jingles to signify Finn has respawned inside the game.] Oh, Finn!
Finn:  Yo, what up?
Jake:  Oh, Finn! You're alive! [Jake hugs Finn's face.]
Finn:  Yeah. I got extra lives, man!
Jake:  Oh my gosh. Let's never die again! There's nothing more precious than a life! Ooh, dude, look. Coins! Oh man, oh man! [Jake jumps off of Finn to go to coins.] Heeheehee! [Jake jumps up to grab a coin.] Ooh! Oh, man, dude, these coins are thick! Let's take 'em back to the real world! We'll be filthy stinkin' rich!
Finn:  Whoa!
Finn and Jake:  Hunny Bunny!
Jake:  No!
Finn:  Time to use the bomba! [Camera shows a pixelated bomb on the top of the screen.] Come to me, bomba. [Finn waits expectantly. Nothing happens.] Bomba! [Camera shows bomba still at the top of the screen.] Oh, bomba! I can't select you without my controller!
Jake:  Let's get outta here, Finn!
Finn:  Man, we've never run away from Hunny Bunny!
Finn:  Firepit, Bouncy Bee, Hunny Bunny. They're supposed to be the easy parts! They're all hard as butts! Sleepy Sam is gonna be the ultimate butt-kicker!
Jake:  Look, Finn. The most important thing to remember is that I still have one giant coin.
Finn:  Man, get a hold of your brains! We need to stay alert for Sleepy Sam!
Jake:  Hey, that's him right there! [Jake points to a light green blob.]
Finn:  Get down! [Jake and Finn duck down.] What's he doing? He's probably trying to psych me out! [Finn looks at his pixelated hands. He closes them in fists and grunts. He starts crawling over to Sleepy Sam. he starts muttering to himself.] I'm gonna break you, Sam. When I'm done, they'll call you...uh, Stinky Sam. Stupid Frog.
Finn:  [looking at hands] M-m-my mitts didn't- didn't work! Come on, help me punch him!
Jake:  Okay!
Jake:  Let's get outta here, man! We're gonna die!
Finn:  I can see the light! We're almost there!
Finn:  Oh no, man. It's the edge of the screen! We're trapped and they'll be here any second.
Jake:  Wait, dude! The bomba!
Finn:  We can't get the bomba!
Jake:  Wait, dude. [Jake stretches up to the top of the screen and grabs the bomba.] Hmm.
Finn:  Jake? Jake!
Jake:  What if I...? [Jake reaches to grab the 2D bomba from the top of the screen.]
Finn:  That's not how it works!
Finn:  Jake, let go of that!
Jake:  [still holding on] But we need the bomba!
Jake:  Finn!
Finn:  Oh, holy cow! That was nuts, man!
Jake:  Yeah, man. And I got my coin! [looks at coin] What?! A penny?! [BMO starts grunting.] BMO! [Finn and Jake walk over to where BMO is lying down.] Oh no! Are you alright buddy?
BMO:  [The hole Jake and Finn came out of is start shooting out blue electric current.] Did you have to- oh no! Wait! Run!
Finn:  No, no, no! Don't kill us, man! No!
Jake:  Aw man, don't kill us! We don't have extra lives!
Sleepy Sam:  Oh wait. Hold up, guys. Check it out! Sunshine!
Sleepy Sam:  Oh boy, that feels good!
Hunny Bunny:  Alright! See ya later, Sam! [Hunny Bunny and Bouncy Bee exit.]
Finn:  [directed toward Sleepy Sam] You mean, that's it? You're not gonna kill us?
Sleepy Sam:  [chuckles] Of course not. The game's over; we won! All we wanted was the sunshine. And to kill that computer that's been imprisoning us for so many years.
Finn:  ...what?
BMO:  Help! Oh no!
Finn and Jake:  BMO!
Sleepy Sam:  Oh sure. He's dangerous! If he hits his button again, back we go.
Finn:  BMO, quick! Hit your button!
BMO:  I can't, Finn! I'm stuck!
Sleepy Sam:  You want him to hit his button? What's wrong with you?!
Jake:  We'll save you, BMO! Finn, go!
BMO:  They're too strong! Use the combo move, Finn! The combo- [Hunny Bunny drenches BMO in honey so he cannot finish his sentence.]
Finn:  The combo move? That never works!
Jake:  Listen! You got this, man! I know you- [Jake is sucked up by Sleepy Sam. He pops out again to finish his sentence.] I know you can do it, buddy! You got this! [Jake is sucked up by Sleepy Sam again.]
Finn:  [concentrating] Okay, okay. You got this, Finn! For your friends! [Finn breathes in heavily. As he says the directions, he moves along with them. He starts to glow a blue-white color.] Up! Down! Left! Left! Right! Right! Down! Spin! Down! Up! Left! Right! Left! Down! Spin! Up! Down! Jump!!
Finn:  Whoa.
Jake:  Woohoo! [Jake jumps into Finn's arm.] You did it, Finn! I knew you had the stuff! Right, BMO?
Finn:  Oh, crud!
Jake:  BMO!
Finn:  I'm sorry, buddy!
BMO:  Finn, I told you about the danger! And now look! You fricasseed my stuff and broke our house all up!
Finn:  I know, I know. I was double butt. For real. [Scene shows BMO looking annoyed.] Man! Now that we know what to expect, next time will be way more fun!
Jake:  Yeah, yeah!
Finn:  How 'bout it, BMO? You in?
BMO:  [BMO starts doing the combo move, which makes him start glowing.]
Finn:  Hey! Don't do the combo move on us!
Jake:  We were only joking!
Finn:  BMO! Stop messing around!
