Jake: [sniffs] Blegh. Your tooth looks bad, dude. It smells like a garden shed in here.
Finn: [groans in pain]
Jake: Finn, I think you have to go dentist.
Finn: I can't go dentist, Jake. You gotta take care of it.
Jake: [sighs] Just go dentist, dude. [approaches rotten tooth] Okay. Easy does it. [presses against tooth]
Finn: [screams]
Jake: [screams]
Finn: [panting]
Jake: [exiting mouth] This is so bad. What did Princess Bubblegum say when you showed her?
Finn: Ahhhhhhhhhh.
Princess Bubblegum: Hmm. Finn, this is literally serious. You have to go dentist.
Finn: NOOOOOO!
Jake: Dude. You. Got. To. Go. Dentist.
Finn: [running out] Nooooo! I'm too strong for the world! [falls off bridge, crashes through the roof of the treasure room] I don't want to go dentist, Jake. The put you in a hole filled with snakes and rotten butter and they leave you there.
Jake: Come on, man. It's not that bad.
Finn: [sighs] Okay.
Finn: [screams]
Jake: Right?
Jake: Whup!
Finn: [screams as he falls to the bottom of the well] This isn't so bad... [his sword lands next to him] My sword! Wonder wh-- [screams]
Finn: Soft sand. [turns and sees an ant] Ant.
Ant: Welcome to dentist, cadet. [salutes] I'm Lieutenant Gamergate. [sniffs] Snakes and rotten butter. A common mistake--you were expected to arrive with snacks and a flashlight. Either way, you're here.
Finn: So... dentist is ants?
Gamergate: Dentist is dentist, cadet! Drop and give me twenty!
Finn: I don't have any money.
Gamergate: Funny man goes dentist, huh? The queen's office is in the royal hill.
Finn: Holes. [opens door and turns the chair around to face him; it's empty] Hmm.
Queen: Listen, I wasn't here when you came in. I'm a very busy woman. [sits down, swivels chair to face the wall, then swivels it back to face Finn] Hello. My name is General Tarsal. I am the current queen of this regiment, and please have a seat.
General Tarsal: As a first-time recruit, I'm confident that you have no idea what you're doing here.
Finn: My tooth hurts.
General Tarsal: Let's take a look at your file. [opens drawer, takes out folder] Ahh, you're a fighter! [to herself] We could use a fighter.
Finn: My tooth hurts.
General Tarsal: What? Of course it does. Let me explain. You have gone dentist. That means that you will server a brief tour of duty, and in exchange we will provide full dental rehabilitation. You will be on the front, fighting monsters. Monstrous monster worms!
Finn: Worms.
General Tarsal: The worms are employed by the flies.
Finn: Worms.
General Tarsal: Work for the flies. You fight them; we'll fix your teeth.
Finn: Me.
General Tarsal: Yes, you! [opens map] Your mission is to secure this junction at all costs. Upon completion of service, you will be sworn to absolute secrecy. The flies have spies everywhere. Fly spies!
Finn: Heh heh. [imagines a fly dressed like a spy]
General Tarsal: These worms are no joke, so you'll be assigned a partner. Ah, let's see... Cadet... Tiffany Oiler.
Finn: Tiffany?!
Tiffany: [in Finn's mind] Tiffany! Finn, I'm gonna kill you!
Finn: That guy wants to kill me!
General Tarsal: Tough nuts, that's dentist.
Loudspeaker: Cadets, dinner is being served in the mess hall, central hill subtunnel eight.
Finn: Hm. Do you have anything less sugary?
Tiffany: Yo, Finn! I'm gonna kill you!
Finn: [sighs] [to himself] Doin' it for my tooth. [sits beside Tiffany]
Tiffany: [growls and beats his chest] Ruff! Thought so. [shovels sugar into his mouth]
Finn: [sighs] Hey, uh, partner. Um. So how are you doing, Tiffany?
Tiffany: Yeah, I lost my teeth eating the Baker's Shard. It's a lot of sugar, right?
Finn: Oh. Did you already know what dentist is?
Tiffany: See, this is a good example of why I want to kill you. You're ignorant. [pokes Finn between the eyes] Heed my words, Finn. As the miller's wheel forever outrages the seed, so the good apple boringly receives his neighbor's worm.
Finn: [quietly] The hey?
Tiffany: And all the corn gets smushed to grease--to grease under the miller's fleaping wheel.
Tiffany: You're getting greased!
Finn: Tiffany, look. We gotta work together, right? Why don't we let bygones be bygones?
Tiffany: Bygones? Ha! [points to peach] That's you. Bye! [smashes peach with tray] Gone!
Finn: [sighs] Do you want my peach?
Tiffany: Bye-gone! [smashes Finn's peach]
Gamergate: Hey! Stand down, cadets! Retire to your bunks!
Tiffany: Tonight, light's out. Tomorrow, your eyes out!
Finn: What the stork, man? This is my special sword. Why didn't you take one of those ant swords they offered you back there?
Tiffany: I don't need some fancy thinger to kick butt when I've got these! [raises fists] You know about these?
Finn: No.
Tiffany: You will. Anyway, I just kinda wanted your sword 'cause it's pretty cool, I guess. Whatever. I'll get it soon enough... from off your dead corpse, you chump! [laughs]
Finn: [sighs]
Finn: Hey, Tiffany... you know, we're really not so different, you and I.
Tiffany: Bullstuff.
Finn: Well, we're both friends with Jake, and that's something, right?
Tiffany: I was friends with Jake. Then some baritone herb stole him away from me.
Finn: I didn't steal him. We're broth--
Tiffany: And when that snow-white wiener dog is finally dead, Jake will be devastated.
Tiffany: He'll need a shoulder to cry whiny, Finn-style tears on, and that shoulder will be mine--Tiffany's! Then I can get busy with undoing your cheesy influence, plus more! With my help, Jake will become the criminal juggernaut he was always meant to be.
Tiffany: We won't just be robbing banks anymore.
Tiffany: We'll be robbing the actual banks. The whole banks!
Tiffany: You get it? We're gonna steal actual whole buildings.
Finn: Yeah, I get it.
Tiffany: So don't tell me we're not so different, okay?! We're opposites, you and me. Oil and goody-goody snow-white baby-vanilla bean mitten water! Go, Tiffany! [runs off]
Finn: [unsheathes sword] Man, that nut's gonna try and stick me while I'm not even looking. [sees his reflection in the sword's gem] Don't even stress it, Finn. You're Finn Mertens, man. You got this. [sighs] Man, I hope so.
Tiffany: Finn! Get in here, quick!
Finn: The junction.
Tiffany: There's something moving in the walls. It was like [imitates sound].
Finn: Wall worms! Holy cow!
Finn: Dang it, Tiffany, not yet! We got to work together to beat the worms! Here they come!
Finn: Tiffany!
Finn & Tiffany: Oh, snap! Look out! They're coming in from the side!
Tiffany: You good?
Finn: My tooth hurts.
Finn: Dang! It's the head worm, and she's livid! I say we get the heck out of heeeeere--!
Tiffany: Finn!
Finn: [hanging on to the ledge] Tiffany, quick! Pull me up! Quick, Tiffany! I'm slipping!
Finn: Dang it, Tiffany! Weren't you paying attention? We're two peas in a pod! We're not oil and water. We're oil and vinegar! It's good, man. It's yummy!
Tiffany: Mm...
Finn: It's good for you!
Tiffany: [sighs] You're right, Finn. I can't bring myself to do it...
Tiffany: ...but I can't bring myself to save you, either.
Tiffany: Why are you still smiling?
Finn: Sorry. I didn't hear what you said. I was just gonna let it slide.
Tiffany: Look, you're--you're on your own. I'm sorry.
Tiffany: Catch you on the flip, I guess.
Finn: Tiffany? [His hand slips] Tiffa-- [falling] nooooooooo!
Tiffany: [screams]
General Tarsal: Whoa! Easy, son. Don't try to speak. Your mouth is full of ants.
Finn: Huh?
Ant: It's okay. We just finished up.
Finn: Ah. [smacks lips] What happened down there? Where's Tiffany?
General Tarsal: Well, the good news is the worm queen was defeated, choked to death on some foreign object, presumably Cadet Tiffany, who is missing in action, which is the bad news.
Finn: Tiffany...
General Tarsal: But we didn't have to fix his teeth, which is nice news. But we did have to fix your teeth, which is okay news.
Finn: [biting] Huh huh. Ayyyy!
General Tarsal: So, on behalf of the ant nation, I'd like to thank you for your service, which is now concluded. As soon as you're ready, we'll get you stuffed back up there well with all the snakes and butter.
Finn: Holy cow.
Princess Bubblegum: Welcome home, Finn.
Jake: Yeah. Welcome home, buddy.
Finn: Thanks, you guys! Man, you'll never believe it. Dentist is actually--
Princess Bubblegum: Eh-eh-eh! [zips her lips]
Finn: It was crazy! Tiffany was there--
Starchie: Hey, deh-deh-deh! [puts his finger to his lips]
Finn: Wait. You all knew? What the heck? Why didn't you tell--
Jake: Ah-ah-ah! [points to fly spy]
