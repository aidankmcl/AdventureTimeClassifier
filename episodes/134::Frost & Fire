Finn:  Huh. Is this, like, eating for you?
Flame Princess:  I don't know about eating, but it feels nice.
Finn:  Hmm. [gets up, grabs a log, and hands it to Flame Princess]
Ice King:  Hey! [hovering in air] You two should get a room! You and that log! Not you and Finn. 'Cause you're huggin' a log, you weirdo! [laughs]
Flame Princess:  Finn.
Finn:  Huh?
Flame Princess:  Let me. [burns log to a crisp and flies up toward Ice King as Finn gasps]
Ice King:  [laughs, then gulps] Hey now, stay away from me! Shoo shoo! [shoots icicles from hands]
Ice King:  Oh, so you wanna get real, do ya? Well, check this! You seeing this? [starts to form a giant snowball, but is interrupted by Flame Princess punching him in the stomach]
Finn:  [watching snowball fall down and crash onto trees] Whoa.
Flame Princess:  [grabs Ice King's beard and starts slapping him] Why don't you get a room?! [Flame Princess flies in a heart shape. She kicks Ice King at the bottom, and at the center where the bumps meet, catches him. She lifts his tunic and burns his buttocks.]
Ice King:  Ow! My hams!
Flame Princess:  Beat it, you freaky old trump! [kicks Ice King into the Ice Kingdom]
Finn:  [gets up] Huh? What's cookin'? Smells good.
Finn:  [while laughing] My body is engulfed in flames! [laughs] Oh, so good!
Jake: [Singing Egg Song to himself.]
Finn:  Jake! Jake! I had an awesome dream! Flame Princess was there; My body was on fire. I think it was inspired by Flame Princess battling Ice King yesterday!
Jake:  That's weird. I had a dream too. I'll tell you about it!
Jake:  So then paintings were found and everybody's eyes lit up. Cinnamon Bun smiled and said: "I saw it from miles away"...
Finn:  [in his thoughts] Man, I need to have that dream again. I have to get Flame Princess to beat down Ice King again.
Flame Princess:  Why'd you pick this spot?
Finn:  Why does anyone do anything?
Flame Princess:  Hmm...why do they?
Finn:  [starts shaking a bag of marshmallows] Mmm?
Flame Princess:  No thanks.
Finn:  [puts a marshmallow in his mouth] Suit yourself!
Ice King:  [whistling while flying and holding grocery bags]
Finn:  [muffled] Hey, look! [swallows then repeats] Hey, look! There's that big jerk you hate so much, remember?
Ice King:  [looks over at the two] Oh, hey, kids! Fine day for a picnic.
Finn:  [in mock shock] Oh, dang. Did you hear that?! I think he's, like, making fun of you.
Flame Princess:  What?!
Finn:  Yeah, it's in the tone of his voice.
Flame Princess :  [stops the Ice King in midair] What did you say to me?
Ice King:  Uh, what? What did I say?
Flame Princess:  [gasps] It is in the tone of your voice.
Ice King:  Look, just take whatever you want. Okay? Take it all! [throws contents of bag at Flame Princess] It's all just prunes! Prunes and liver! Frozen, of course.
Ice King:  [rising up from the ground] Ah. You might have what it takes to slap these old jowls, but do you have what it takes to face my- just a second... [zaps the ground as Snow Monsters rise from the ground] Legion of Snow Warriors?! Go, fight! Protect me! [Two warriors break apart while the other two shamble off in the distance.] Oh, boy.
Flame Princess:  I don't like being made fun of, Ice King. I don't like it at all! [throws fire at Ice King]
Ice King:  Woah! [gets up and protects self with ice shields]
Ice King:  Oh, man. Times! I call time! [builds a barrier around him that looks like his head and starts to weep in it]
Flame Princess:  It's only okay if the person making the fun is someone I'm cool with! [punches Ice King's barrier]
Ice King:  We're totes cool! I-I'm Ice King!
Flame Princess:  [while punching Ice King's barrier] And they do it in a respectful and knowing way!
Ice King:  Respect? I got all kinds of respect!
Flame Princess:  Oh, yeah? Then what's with that stupid smirking face?
Ice King:  [sees Snow Monster coming up behind Flame Princess and smirks] Smirk? I smirk when I'm nervous.
Snow Monster:  Bear hug! [hugs Flame Princess]
Ice King:  And also when I'm about to win! [laughs] Booyah! [turns around and lifts back of tunic] And I didn't even get to test out my new fire-proof grundies!
Finn:  Put it away, man! You didn't win nothing!
Finn:  [to Flame Princess] Are you okay? You feel... lukewarm.
Flame Princess:  I-I just need to burn a couple of forests or something. And get a good night's sleep.
Finn:  Yeah. Sleep.
Finn:  [picks up a glass of milk] Milk. [drinks the entire glass and picks up another glass of milk] Milk. [drinks the entire glass quickly] Play the sleep jam, BMO.
BMO:  [nods and plays White Noise[1]]
Finn:  Mmm. What's cookin'? Smells good. Wha?! [turns to see Ice King shooting ice at his groin] What?! Oh, no!
Finn:  [runs to Jake downstairs, who is drinking some tea] Jake! I had another dream. My body was being blasted. But this time, Ice King was blasting me with ice cubes! Aww. It was awful! And someone else was there. He was just laughing and laughing. He was in the first dream too, but he was whispering. I couldn't make out what he was saying. Oh, yeah! [snaps fingers] It was the Cosmic Owl!
Jake:  [spits out tea] What?! You didn't tell me the Cosmic Owl was there!
Finn:  I couldn't see him last time!
Jake:  Dude, that means it was a prophetic dream! You have to finish the original dream! Cosmic Owl could be whispering something wildly significant! You have to get Flame Princess and Ice King to fight again so you can see the end of the dream! Make 'em fight!
Finn:  [runs over to a wooden desk and starts writing a letter] Dear Ice King, you smell like stink, you're unpleasant, you're not funny, you're old, blah blah blah, sincerely, the Flame Princess. P.S., let us fight. [yells and grabs another piece of paper and writes another letter] Dear Flame Princess, you're just the worst, your hair is bad, your feet smell like face cheeks, blah blah blah, let's meet up and fight, dummy, sincerely, Ice King. [looks at two letters and grunts in approval] Flame Princess fight Ice King.
Finn:  Ice King!
Ice King:  What?
Ice King:  Ooh, beard mail! [reading off letter] Dear Ice King, you're not funny, you're old, and no princess will ever marry you ever, simple Simon. [in his own thoughts] Oh, fight.
Finn:  Flame Princess! [drops letter on ground]
Flame Princess:  Huh? [reading off letter] Dear Flame Princess, your feet smell like face cheeks, your stupid candles smell heinous, and you can't even kiss Finn without totes freakin' out! [yells in anger]
Ice King:  Not my beard! [Flame Princess punches Ice King in his face. Gunter pops out of Ice King's beard and shoots water at Flame Princess. Ice King laughs. Both Ice King and Flame Princess fly above dark clouds that have formed and perform aerial attacks. Scene switches to the Candy castle, and Princess Bubblegum looks out of her window.]
Princess Bubblegum:  What is all that noise? [looks at the fight] Ach, mein Glob!
Flame Princess:  Inferno...shot! [Flame Princess shoots fire at Ice King.]
Ice King:  Ice...the King! [Ice King shoots ice at Flame Princess.]
Flame Princess:  Stop that!
Ice King:  [laughing] How's about some of this? [gets Flame Princess into a headlock and starts rubbing her hair]
Ice King:  [falling over] Oh beans, oh beans, oh beans!
Finn:  I maybe went too far with this jazz. [looks down and sees he is stepping in a pile of water and hears Flame Princess growling] Flame Princess! Oh, too hot. [falls over and is knocked unconscious]
Finn:  Oh! [chuckles and then starts to steam through his clothes] Huh? [looks over at Flame Princess who is staring at him] Uh...
Cosmic Owl:  You blew it.
Finn:  [wakes up] Huh? [gets up and sees the destruction he's caused]
Finn:  Okay, I can fix this. I can make it right.
Finn:  Ice King!
Ice King:  [under a sheet of ice] Finn!
Finn:  I'm so sorry, man.
Ice King:  [weakly] Help Gunter. Please! [Finn walks over to Gunter.] I meant after you saved me.
Finn:  Oh. [Gunter quacks again. Finn puts him under his shirt.] C'mon. Let's get out of here. [lifts ice sheet off of Ice King and then grabs Ice King]
Ice King:  Oh! That's right, carry me like a princess.
Flame Princess:  Ice King! You can't escape me! [shoots a fire ball at Ice King]
Finn:  [turns around] Huh?
Flame Princess:  [gasps] Finn!
Ice King:  [shoots fire ball with ice] Ice. [fire ball falls into the water, frozen] Whatever.
Flame Princess:  [at normal size again] I'm so, so sorry, Finn! Are you alright?
Finn:  No, princess. I'm the one who's sorry. [drops Ice King] Ice King hasn't been picking fights with you, it's...it's been me all along.
Ice King:  [annoyed] What?
Flame Princess:  So, you wrote that letter?
Finn:  Yes, but look, it's just like, I had this dream and it was because of that fight you had. It was weird, but I also liked it. But it was important because the Cosmic Owl was [Flame Princess decides Finn's words have no meaning, and all she hears is wah for every syllable for a couple of seconds.] So I had to get you to beat up Ice King-
Flame Princess:  Shh. I should have known. That letter said things in it that only you would know. Personal things, Finn. And you used them against me. I thought you were the one person I could- I need some time alone.
Finn:  Princess!
Finn:  But, I said I was sorry.
Ice King:  You blew it, man.
