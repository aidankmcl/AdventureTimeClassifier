Princess Bubblegum: What the... [she breaks the seal on the letter and reads it aloud] "mmmmn Princess Bubblegum, we are starving, immediately send us all of your candy. How dare you, ours, Lemon Grabs." [stops reading] Bull gunk! I left them a lifetime supply of candy!
Princess Bubblegum: Hey Finn! Hey Jake! Can you come up here? I have a job for you!
Finn: Okay!
Jake: [getting up] Sorry CB, we'll finish this up later.
Finn: [entering room] Hey, Preebs.
Princess Bubblegum: Hey, guys. I got a letter from the earls of Lemongrab. They've gone through all the food that I've sent them. [gestures to case] This case contains precious candy seeds for the Lemongrabs to grow new food. [closes case] So, I need you two to deliver these seeds to Lemon Castle. [hands case to Jake]
Finn: For sure. We'll do it.
Princess Bubblegum: [saluting] Good luck, gentlemen!
Cinnamon Bun: [waving] Bye, girlfriend! [laughs]
Jake: Hey, Lemongrabs! You home?
Finn: Holy--!
Finn: [worried] Jake? Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!
Jake: [smacking a Lemon spider off his arm] Kiss it!
Finn: Aah! Sorry, dudes--got no food! No... food! [Lemon goat bites Finn's hand] Hey!
Jake: Hey! Weirdos! [stretches his hand into a slice of cake] Get the birthday cake!
Lemonjon: Are you lemon?
Finn and Jake: Whoa!
Jake: What the thing is up with this guy?
Lemonjon: Does your head come to a nub?
Jake: What?
Lemonjon: You are un-lemon.
Finn: Yeah. Cool, man. Hey, do you know where--?
Lemonjon: I am Lemonjon. I see you made it past our Lemon mmmmmmmeringerie!
Finn: Wait, what?
Lemonjon: They're quite hungry.
Finn: Yeah. What the heck's going on here?
Lemonjon: There is no food, only Lemons--Lemons with bellies empty but for lemon lusts!
Finn: Whatever, Lemonjon. We've gotta give those dumb-butts these seeds.
Jake: Where should we go?
Lemonjon: Mmmmmmmy senses tell me that they're in the dungeon. They've been there for three weeks. Three weeks, dungeon.
Jake: I wonder who put them in there.
Finn: I don't know, but we gotta bust them out! Which way to the dungeon, Lemonjon?
Jake: Oh, cool!
Finn: [running to hole] Thanks, man!
Jake: [going through hole] Yeah, thanks, man!
Jake: [turns around] Hmmm.
Jake: Hmmm.
Finn: [opening door] Yo, Lemon-wipes!
Jake: Yech.
Jake: Um, maybe we should hands... for safety.
Finn: [taking Jake's hand] Yeah, sure!
Jake: So, where'd you want to look ne--[looks at what he's holding, which turns out to be a green Lemon creature that starts licking his hand.] Eeeh! [yanks hand away] Uh, Finn?!
Finn: [down the hall] Oh, sorry dude.
Finn: [opening door] Stay close to me.
Jake: [closes door] Nope!
Jake: [running to door] I think this is it.
Finn: [ratting handle] All locked up! [looks through bars] There they are! Hey, Lemongrabs, we're here! We're gonna get you out, just hold tight!
Lemongrab: Go away.
Lemongrab 2: No food here.
Jake: Maybe the kidnapper's in there, too, coercing them.
Finn: Probably the grossest one of all, too--beet red skin, barf, poopin' all its junk-sculpture.
Jake: Ah, stop, man! You're just makin' it worse! [makes fist huge] Let's just get this over with. [punches down door]
Finn: Lemongrabs, you're free!
Lemongrab: They broke the door! The door is broken now!
Lemongrab 2: FIX THE DOOR!
Jake: Fix the door? What?! What? Fix the door? Fix--what? What's goin' on here? Fix the door. Finn, what's goin' on? Fix the door.
Lemongrab: It doesn't matter anymore.
Lemongrab 2: There is no more candy to hoard. Let them keep what crumbs they find, for there are no crumbs.
Lemongrabs: [Half screaming, half singing] NO CRUMBS!
Finn: Are you saying you locked yourselves down here with all the food so you could eat it yourselves?
Jake: You know there's guys starvin' up there?!
Lemongrab: Hmm. No, no. You do not understand. It is not us for whom they starve, but them...
Lemongrab 2: ...for whom they starve.
Lemongrab: Mm! Yes, yes! For the candy food was not consumed--no, no--but was given life!
Finn: Wha--?
Lemongrab: You see, Finn, [starts pacing] when Mother Princess last visited Lemongrab...
Lemongrab 2: ...when she saw fit to create me, Lemongrab...
Lemongrab:  [holds up formula]...she left behind a little something-something: the secret formula for creating candy life! She must have meant for us to have it, to keep making more family.
Lemongrab 2: Yes, yes! All her fault!
Lemongrab: What? What'd you say?
Lemongrab 2: I said, "all her fault."
Lemongrab: Oh, indeed! For once we had commenced, how could we desist?
Lemongrab 2: I looked deep in myself and found that I'm a guy who can't stop making candy life from the food he needs.
Lemongrab: Me, too.
Lemongrab 2: It just felt so pretty okay inside, greeting each new placid face...
Lemongrab: ...and hearing each new piercing song!
Plop-Top: [screams]
Lemongrab 2: We used the last of the food to make Plop-Top, here.
Lemongrab: Mm. I thought we said Dump-Dome.
Lemongrab 2: [screams] Who cares anyway? They've brought no food! We're all going to die!
Finn: Look. We brought these seeds. [opens case] They're special candy seeds.
Jake: You can grow new food now.
Lemongrab: [walks over] Oh, yes. [taking seeds] Hmm, mm-hmm, mmhm. Yes. [pushes Plop-Top off of table, squishes seeds together]
Lemongrab 2: Yes, yes. There we go! [pours formula onto wad]
Lemongrab: Ha-haaa! We'll call you Seed-Wad!
Lemongrab 2: [admiringly] Ooh!
Jake: You really are gonna die.
Finn: ...and all your boys, too!
Lemongrab: Our... boys?
Finn: Come on. We'll take you to see Princess Bubblegum. She knows more about candy than anyone; she built a whole kingdom out of candy!
Lemongrab: Yes. Okay.
Lemongrab 2: For our boys.
Lemongrab: But first we will notify the children of our impending departure...
Lemongrabs: ...so they won't worry about us while we're away.
Lemongrab: Okay, yes. The hard times are over!
Lemongrab 2: Mmmm, here's the plan...
Lemongrab: We will go to the Candy Kingdom and take all their candy from them! Then we will give that candy precious life and build a candy army so we may then go forth and pillage candy for all to eat!
Lemongrab 2: Now go, young Lemonjon!
Lemongrab: Go! Go!
Finn: What's going on, Lemongrabs?!
Lemongrab: It's all [points finger at Finn] your fault!
Lemongrab 2: [points finger at Finn] All your fault!
Lemongrab: We warned you!
Lemongrab 2: We warned you about us!
Finn: Yaaaah! [pants, looks down at Lemonjon's leg] What the--?
Finn and Jake: [as Lemonjon starts walking] Whoaaaaaa!
Finn: Jake! Are you alright?
Jake: Yeah, but look! [points] He's heading right for the Candy Kingdom!
Finn: [gasps] And he's too big to duke it out with! Unless...
Jake: Giant poison candy aspirin! [holds up large pill] I've got this one, but it might be too small.
Finn: No. We'll kick him in his heart 'til he's history. Those must have been Lemonjon's guts we saw before. His heart is his weak spot.
Jake: Yeah, but we'll never find it again in time... unless that's it there [points] with the juice coming out. Remember all that juice, from before?
Finn: Oh yeah, that's probably it. [Jake stretches them over to the grate] Whoaaa! [Finn opens grate and climbs in, retches as liquid drenches him] Oh, man!
Jake: [climbing in] Tastes like vitamins.
Finn: [grunting and punching the heart]
Jake: Are you sure this is it? It's not even doing anything.
Finn: Just smash it already, grandma.
Jake: Right. [grows hands and hits the heart hard]
Finn: [sarcastically] Oh, nice one, Jake.
Lemonjon: [stops walking] Whoa, hold the phone! What is this powerful new juice coursing fromst my core source? [groans] The juice aches. Is this the rumored ache of feeling? The feeling of caring unknown to Lemons? New thoughts emerge! If I act, the Candy People will suffer. If I don't, the Lemon people will suffer. The greater good demands but one course only: that I dissolve the bonds uniting me and become component to all!
Finn: Whoa, dang! [picks up some candies] That Lemonjon turned himself all up into lemon candy! Man, that Lemonjon's all right.
Princess Bubblegum: [erasing] ...and... there... we... go. [blows on Lemongrab's brain] All done! The last trace of the candy life formula is out of their heads!
Finn: ...and I snatched this [holds up formula] out of the Lemon castle, boyee!
Princess Bubblegum: Now we all just have to keep a closer eye on those two so they don't get in to any more trouble.
Jake: But how come we don't just fix their hearts like we did with Lemonjon so they're more selfless and less selfish?
Princess Bubblegum: Oh, no, no. Their hearts are fine. They're just like this.
Lemongrabs: [smiling] Hmm!
