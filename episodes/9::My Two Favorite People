Jake: Pussy cat! Come here!
Jake:  Hey!
Jake:  Help!
Finn: Don't worry! His spells never last long.
Jake:  Who are these guys? This is a great fight!
Finn:  Yeah! You never fought them? They come out every day at four oclock on the dot.
Jake: I guess that's because I meet Lady Rainicorn every day at four o'clock on the dot. Oh shoot! I'm late!
Finn:  You should stay, man. At five o'clock every day, I chop both their heads off, and they grow them back for the next day.
Jake:  Aw, man, that sounds awesome! I do want to stay and fight those guys, but I also want to hang out with my girlfriend.
Finn:  Boo!
Jake:  [sighs] I should probably go. I'll see ya later, buddy. [Jake rides off in his bike.] Finn
Jake:  [sighs] Oh!
Jake:  Sorry! Sorry I'm late. Finn and I were fighting this shark and science cat, and I lost track of time. Anyway, Im here now, M'lady, and I have brought to you half an orange.
Lady Rainicorn:  Ooh! ! ("Thanks!") [A beam from her horn hits a tree and turns it blue.]
Jake:  Nice! Now make that green! [Lady turns the river green.]
Jake:  [giggles] Ha ha ha! Yeah, that's good.
Lady Rainicorn:  [yawns]  . (" I may have to go to sleep.")
Jake:  Sleep! But we were supposed to play viola together!
Lady Rainicorn:  . ("I'm sorry.")] [Kisses Jake on the head.]   . ("It's because you came late.")
Jake:  [sighs] Yeah. Sorry again for coming so late.
Lady Rainicorn:   . ("Good night.")  Jake
Shelby: [Pops out of the viola.] Hi Jake.
Jake:  Oh, hey, Shelby.
Shelby:  Why you looking so down in the dumps?
Shelby:  No response, huh? Guess you're good.
Jake:  I'm fed up, Shelby!
Shelby:  Hmm?
Jake:  Whenever I hang out with Lady Rainicorn, I miss out on fun times with Finn.
Jake:  And then when I hang out with Finn, I'm missin' out on Lady Rainicorn! [He lifted his hands in the air and he crashes into a tree.] Oh!
Shelby:  [Popping out of the viola again.] Hey, Jake, why don't you just hang out with both of them at the same time?
Jake:  [Jake props himself up, throwing the leaves off.] And then I won't miss anything! Shelby! My problems are solved.
Jake:  Ah, isn't this great? This is totally great. [To Finn] Isn't it?
Finn:  Yeah.
Jake:  [To Lady Rainicorn] Isn't it?
Lady Rainicorn:  . ("Youre right.") [Jake laughs deeply.]
Finn:  [Excitedly] What? What did she say?
Jake:  She said she also thinks it's great.
Finn:  Oh.
Jake:  Yeah.
Jake:  Hmm... [Jake crawls up in front of them.] Hey, did you know that you both have an awesome sense of humor?
Finn:  We do?
Jake:  Yeah! Anybody have a joke?
Finn:  Oh, I have a joke! [Laughs.] Okay, [laughs] okay. Knock knock.
Lady Rainicorn:   ("Who's there?")
Jake:  She said, "who's there?"
Finn:  Diarrhea!
Jake:   . ("He said "diarrhea.")
Lady Rainicorn:  ,  . ,  . ("Oh, I got it too. What was that? It hardly qualifies as a joke.") [Sips drink]
Finn:  Did she say diarrhea who?
Jake:  Uh, no. No, she didn't say, "diarrhea who?" She didn't... say it. Lady, how 'bout you tell a joke?
Lady Rainicorn:  ..  ? !          ? [Jake and Lady Rainicorn giggle]      ! ("Maybe... What could it have been? Ah! Do you remember when we got completely naked, and frantically ran around in the farmer's cabbage patch? [Jake and Lady giggle] That farmer got crazy mad!")
Finn:  What's the joke?
Jake:  Uhh... well, the joke doesnt translate very well.
Finn:  Man, I- I might leave. Is it okay if I leave? I kind of want to go fight something.
Jake: Noooo! Dont leave. [Gets up to pace.] If there was only some way you two could talk to each other directly. [Pause] Oh, dude! I just remembered! There's a universal translator device at the bottom of Lake Szelezon!
Finn: The lake guarded by evil Lake Knights?
Jake:  Yeah, I can't remember why I threw it in there. Let's all go and get it!
Finn:  Whoa [Runs towards Jake] [whispers] Jake! Youre inviting Rainicorn? No offense, but isn't she a little too sweet for deadly adventure?
Jake:  Trust me, Finn, shes the Rowdy Queen. She can do anything!
Finn:  Hmmm. Alright! Trust pound!
Finn:  Underwater camouflage!
Finn:  Lady! You are incredible! You should adventure with us all the time!
Jake:  [chuckles] All according to plan.
Lady:  ,  . ("Thanks, I enjoyed it too.")
Finn:  Uhhh, what?
Jake:  [Runs up to them] Here's the translator. [He puts the translator around Lady's neck] Lets see here. [Turns on the device and switches through the options] The voice options are... Old man, nerdy alien, ooor nightmare? [He has it switched to nightmare] Try sayin' something toots!
Lady:  [Makes scratchy, grungy noises] [Jake looks disturbed and goes to change it to old man]... and then I ate all the peaches in the orchard, and that farmer was sooo angry!
Finn:  [Laughs] I like this voice!
Lady:  [Jake switches it to nerdy aliens] [Lady makes some gurgley, indistinguishable noises]
Lady:  [Finn laughs again] [Jake switches it back to old man]...and that's the end of my story.
Jake:  [sighs] Well, at least with old man option we can understand him, I MEAN HER! I mean you sugar!
Lady:  Hop on my back and I'll give you a ride home!
Finn:  [laughs] Whatever you say grandpa! [Flips onto her back] Hai-yah!
Lady:  Come on my darling. Wrap your legs around me.
Jake:  [sighs] I remember why I drowned that translator now.
Finn:  Hey grandpa, how are you able to fly if you don't have wings?
Lady:  Well, light travels from the sun. Then bounces off of our planet and then back into our eyes so we can perceive color.
Jake:  Whoa! [Being bounced by Ladys wavy flying style]
Lady:  My body can intercept that light and dance around on it. [Jake is sliding off of her]
Jake:  Lady! It's a little rocky in the back seat here!
Finn:  [laughs] Shmow! [Screen cuts to the Forest Wizard giving away rings] That forest wizard is giving away free power rings!
Lady:  Do you wanna try gettin' some Finn?
Finn:  Yeahs! [Lady dives down towards the clearing]
Jake:  [Flies off Ladys tail end] Laaaadyyy! [Falls towards the forest] Fiiiiinn! [Turns into a flat hang glider-like object] Lady! [Floats down into the trees and onto the ground] [He gets up] Lady! Finn! [He grows huge and shouts above the trees] Y'all around here? [Looks around] Dang it! [Turns to see fireworks coming from the trees accompanied by the sounds of Lady and Finn having fun with the rings]
Finn:  [While the forest wizard does tricks and the small animals cheer] Whoa! Did you see that!? This is like the funnest thing ever!
Jake:  [Burst through the trees and scares everyone away] There you are! [Shrinks down] Where were you guys?
Finn:  Wait a minute, you didn't fly down with us?
Lady:  We thought you were behind us the whole time!
Jake:  Noooo! [Looking sad] I fell off your tail end! [Turns and looks mad] I was shouting your name!
Lady:  [Comes up and nudges him] Ooh! Honey pot, we probably couldn't here you because of the cloud density.
Finn:  Jake! Check out these power rings! [The rings each expel some sort of magical display]
Jake:  Whoa. That's cool! You got ten of them?
Finn:  Yeah! Lady got some too.
Jake:  [Lady shows Jake her rings] Oh, thats cool.
Finn:  Uh, You want one of mine? Ive got so many.
Jake:  Yeah! Thanks man!
Finn:  Oh. Wait, I can't take them off. I guess they're cursed. [Shoots blue flames from his fingertips] Still pretty cool though.
Jake:  Yeah, they're awesome. [Depressed]
Finn:  [Jake takes a sip of his drink] [Finn and Lady laugh] Alright this time Im gonna destroy you Rainicorn!
Lady:  Oh, okay. [Jake starts walking up from behind them] That sounds nice.
Finn:  Oh I got the sword!
Jake:  Hey, Lady, you wanna go play music together or somethin'?
Lady:  Oh, oh. Uh, I would, but I-I'm in the middle of this game.
Jake:  Oh. [Goes over to Finn] Hey Finn. After this next game do you wanna go adventurin' with me?
Finn:  Lady and I are going to a party in the Cloud Kingdom tonight. [Jake looks startled] You should go to that with us.
Jake:  Humph! Humph Humph Humph! [sighs and looks sad] [sighs and grumbles]
Finn:  Jake stop sighing you're messing up my game! [Jake sighs again] Jake! [Finn looks away from screen] Whats goin' on with you!
Jake:  Mmmm, Nothin'!
Finn:  Awww dang it! Man, Lady, youre too good at this! Hey, It's time to party with clouds! Jake, you comin'?
Jake:  No!
Finn:  [Walking up to Jake] Dude, I thought you wanted to spend more time with me and Lady together?
Jake:  I do. [Looking hurt and sad]
Finn:  Then come on.
Jake:  No YOU go ahead! [In a harsh tone] And YOU have fun with MY girlfriend!
Finn:  Uhhh... [Jake sighs] We're gonna head to the party, but you should meet us there and stop acting weird. [Finn walks away]
Jake:  [Finn and Lady are seen flying away outside the window] [sighs]
Jake:  [sighs] [Looks over at a Finn-and-Jake-timeless clock, it is 11:50.] They should be back by now! [He grabs his headset phone and dials the Cloud Kingdom.]
Cloud man:  Hello Cloud Kingdom.
Jake:  Uh, yes, hello. Um, Im lookin' for Finn the Human and Lady Rainicorn. [Cloud man throws a soda to someone] Hello, can you hear me? Hello.
Cloud man:  Yeah, they left a while ago.
Jake:  A while ago?!
Jake:  [Jake bursts through the front door on his bike, looking around frantically. He looks startled.] What the-! [He stops on the hill overlooking Lady's house to find Finn and Lady hanging out without him, changing the color of things like he and Lady used to do.]
Finn:  [Lady changes a tree pink.] [Finn and Lady laugh] Yeah! Now make that orange! [Lady complies.] And make that purple! [Lady complies. Jake gasps.] Wow Lady! Hanging out with you it the best!
Lady:  I like you too Finn.
Jake:  Nooo [Falls onto his knees with his arms in the air] oooooo! My girlfriend... in the arms of my best pal! [Picks up phone] Well, TWO can play at that game, sweet heeks! [He scrolls through his contacts] Let's see... "Doug, Todd, Jerry, Dennis, Reggie, Peter, George, Larry, Luke, David, Benton, Mike R., Mike H., Mike A., Gareth, Jennings, Mr. International, Mr. Outrageous, Captain Majesty, The Flying Lettuce Brothers, Pete the Punk"... [gasp] Tiiffaanyy! [In an evil tone] PERFECT! Muhuhaha! [Calls Tiffany.]
Finn:  [Lady and Finn laughing] Man, I wish Jake was here having fun with us. [Stops and hears viola music] Hey, wheres that music coming from?
Jake: [Him and Tiffany are sitting on stumps playing viola] Yeah, yeah, louder.
Lady:  [Sees Jake and Tiffany] [gasps] Jake what are you doing?
Jake:  Oh, hey guys. I'm just sharing a tender moment with my beautiful friend Tiffany.
Finn:  Stop! You're making Lady jealous!
Jake:  Well Im trying to make you both jealous!
Finn:  [Lady looks mad] Why would I be jealous of Tiffany?
Jake:  Becaaause, Tiffany's a boy! [Tiffany spins around to face the camera]
Tiffany:  [Laughs evilly] Jake's MY best friend now! FOREVER!
Finn:  [Looks extremely startled] [gasps] [Finn growls and leaps towards Tiffany] Yaaaaaaahhh! [Tackles Tiffany out of view][They fight and Tiffany pulls out a knife, but Finn kicks it away] Home wrecker! [They continue fighting]
Lady:  Jake, what's going on with you?
Jake:  [sighs] I guess I'm just jealous of how much you and Finn like each other.
Lady:  I'm hanging out with Finn because you wanted us to get to know each other better.
Jake:  I know. Gaah.
Finn:  [Finn punches Tiffany in the face while on top of him] Get out of my life Tiffany! And never come back [Punches him again]
Tiffany:  [Kicks Finn off of him] No! Jake will be mine!
Jake:  I'm sorry I'm an idiot baby. Forgive me?
Lady:  Oh sweet potato, I love you BECAUSE you're an idiot. You make me feel like a genius!
Jake:  [Lady and Jake laugh] You make me feel like I'm huggin' an old man. It's time to get rid of this piece of crud. [rips translator off and throws it into the grass]
Lady:  [giggles]   ? ("Do you prefer this one?")
Jake:  Yeah! Waaay better! [they hug]
Finn:  Beat it Tiffany! Go on! Get!
Tiffany:  You'll never defeat me! I will! Be Jake's best friend! Because I'm! Tiffanyyyy [Finn spits on his head and he runs off] Ahhhhhh!
Jake:  [Lady is wrapped partially around Jake] I'm sorry I was an idiot. Forgive me?
Finn:  Shut up man, I don't wanna hear that stuff. [He steps into the circle made by Lady] Lemme get in there.
Jake:  Let's never be stupid again.
Finn:  Wait! Let's always be stupid! Forever!
