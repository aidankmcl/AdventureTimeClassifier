Princess Bubblegum:  My king... [Finn's POV is viewed as he opens his eyes.] My king? [Lovingly] ...Wake up, husband.
Finn:  [Small groan] What??
Banana Guards:  Long live the king!
Finn:  What... is... goin' on? [Finn's crown suddenly rises from his head.]
Princess Bubblegum:  Hm. Not much.
Banana Guards:  [Whose bodies are upside-down now] Long live the king!
Finn:  Huh?!?
King Worm:  Wowowowowowow...
Finn:  Hey... do I know you? [Finn reaches for it, but it quickly escapes.] Hey... I know that guy!
Princess Bubblegum:  [To Peppermint Butler] He doesn't know he's dreaming.
Finn:  Huh? [Dream shift] Huh??
Flame Princess:  Come on, honey. Eat your soup.
Finn:  ...Huh...? Wait, wait, wait...
Flame Princess:  EAT IT NOW!!!
Finn:  Mmm... hmm... What kind of--AAAH! How... did we get here? [Flame Princess now has three mouths and is muttering incomprehensibly.] Uh... I'm good on the soup. Huh? [The spoon is now King Worm.] You!
Peppermint Butler:  You haven't much time, sir.
Finn:  What??
Second peppermint head:  You are trapped in a dream.
Peppermint Butler:  And you are in danger. [Finn scowls. Peppermint Butler's face get's scratched off. His hand starts talking.] You need to find this worm and break it.
Finn:  Find the worm? But... you've got 'im right there! [Gasps]
Phil:  Satori!
Finn:  Huh? Huh? Huh? [Finn notices Jake in a window in a bookshelf. He's struggling to wrap a present.] Jake?
Lady Rainicorn:  [Speaking English; incredibly deep voice] Hold down the tape until it fully sticks to the paper.
Jake:  Like this?
Lady Rainicorn:  Yes, but now try holding it higher.
Jake:  Like this?
Lady Rainicorn:  You need more tape. [Dispenses more tape out of her hole.] Use this. [Jake takes the tape and wraps it around the present.] Now, tape the bottom.
Jake:  Who's it for?
Lady Rainicorn:  Who's it for?
Jake:  .....It's for... um...
Lady Rainicorn:  Play this.
Jake:  [Taking viola] Uh... okay.
Finn:  The worm! [Another transparent Finn glides across the real one saying, "The worm!" in an incredibly high-pitched voice. Finn tries to catch it but it goes into a mouse hole.] [Impatiently] Worm... worm... Woyyym! Worm!!
Jake:  Finn! Aw, man, is it really you?
Finn:  [Turns around] Jake? [Looks at mousehole] Yeah. I think so. [Feels himself] Yep.
Jake:  I'm trapped in this dream, and I can't wake up!
Finn:  Me, too! I was just in some other part of the dream with Princess Bubblegum and Flame Princess.
Jake:  Make-out dreams? Nice...
Finn:  What?! [Floats towards Jake] No, it wasn't like that!
Jake:  Hey, I won't judge.
Finn:  ...Lady's got two mouths...
Jake:  Mm-hmm. I don't think she's real.
Finn:  Weird... [He feels her "tape hole." Jake pinches him.] Ouch! What was that for?
Jake:  Just wanted to make sure you were real. Our dreams must be linked for some reason.
Finn:  Whoa... Well... Pep-but told me we gotta find that worm that crawled through that hole and break it. [Scratches head] [Speaking incredibly fast] In my dream-- [Speaking normally] In my dream... suddenly, an unimaginably amazing sword appeared in front of me able to blast the hole open. [The sword appears.] Rad! [Laughs] I usually dream of messed-up stuff, like a shark tryina' bite off my face.
Jake:  Careful! If you grunk up the dreamscape with your subconscious fears, the whole thing'll blow apart!
Finn:  Ohhh.
Jake:  Just shrink down like me.
Finn:  And then I shrunk down like Jake. [Does so]
Finn:  How do you know so much about dreams and stuff?
Jake:  'Cuz I sleep a lot.
Finn:  Heh heh. Oh, yeah.
Ice King:  Fionna, Cake, I need your help!
Finn:  What??
Jake:  What did you say??
Ice King:  I really did it this time! They're loose, and they're coming for us!
Finn:  Who?
Finn & Jake:  AAH!
Finn:  Dad??
Jake:  Help us!
Finn:  Maybe he's not really... real.
Jake:  Dad, are you okay?
Finn:  That scarf looks... familiar...
Jake:  Yeah...
Finn:  Man! The worm is fast!
Jake:  Yeah, it's nuts! Fast as nuts.
Finn:  Well, let's catch it with... [Finn and Jake make their legs bigger.] ...some big ol' legs!
Jake:  Well... that's kinda boring for me... 'cuz that's my normal power, you know?
Finn:  Then you get... birds!
Finn:  Ay ay ay ay ay!
Jake:  Remember, this is just a dream! Keep climbing!
Finn:  Now what?
Jake:  Break it!
Finn:  Jake, are you okay?
Jake:  Yeah. Are you?
Finn:  Yeah. I'm okay.
Finn & Jake:  We did it!
Jake:  Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Finn:  Yeah, yeah, yeah! ...Hmm. [Noticing his reflection] Was that... was that mirror always like that? [They walk to the mirror.] I'm pretty sure this is not normal.
Jake:  [Now having a big human nose] Nope, it's fine.
Finn:  AAH! [A cup falls and shatters on the ground, then rises up un-shattered, repeatedly.] Jake, I think we're still dreaming!
Jake:  Nah, it's just dream residue. Forget about it.
Finn:  [His reflection floats away.] You sure know a lot about dream stuff... [Looks closer at him.] You pinched me earlier, but I never pinched you.
Jake:  [Calmly] Everything's normal. [Finn pinches him. Jake starts to melt.] [Voice getting lower] Everything's norrrmaaaal....
Finn:  It's still a dream. Hmmm... Huh?!
King Worm:  Hey, guys... [Chuckles]
Transparent Finn:  Hey, guys!
Finn:  Why're you jankin' up my dreamscape!?
King Worm:  [Calmly] Listen, don't worry about it.
Finn:  [In disbelief] WHAT?!
King Worm:  You can't defeat me... I'm the king worm. I'm going to keep you in this dreamscape until I've consumed... all your... [Smaller version of himself appears in his mouth]
Smaller King Worm:  ...Life energy!
Finn:  My life energy?! I use that! Aaagh! [Finn charges. His actions are now being represented via a "long, undulating snake."] Wait... something's wrong. I'm missing something. [Furious] Worm!! [Suddenly discouraged] Oh, man... I'm gonna be stuck here... forever.
King Worm:  Ouch! Hey, guys!
Transparent Finn:  Hey, guys!
King Worm:  Knock it off!
Finn:  Huh?
Pictured Jake:  Psst. If you grunk up the dreamscape with your subconscious fears, the whole thing'll blow apart!
Finn:  Hmm? Oh, yeah! Thanks, dream Jake! [Smashes him with a jug; the picture frame becomes many tiny Jakes. Finn's actions once again become a "long, undulating snake."] GET READY TO EAT IT!
King Worm:  Wowowowowowowow...
Finn:  Okay, Finn... Concentrate. Deepest... gut... fears!
Finn:  Oh, gross! [A small fish pops out, too. Finn tastes the water.] The ocean. [Finn starts panicking and screaming.] Okay... Okay, that wasn't so bad. [The Lich pops out of his belly button.] AAAAH!! OH, GLOB! THE LICH!!
King Worm:  [Now shriveled up] [Coughs] Hey, why don't you sit down, or pass out or something?
Finn:  NEVER!!!
Finn:  Bubblegum! WAAA-HOOO!
Princess Bubblegum:  Finn, shush! I'm having coffee with the Lich. You wouldn't understand. You're too young. [Her cup of coffee suddenly explodes with the Lich's power.]
Finn:  SO MUCH SCREAMING!!!
Finn:  [To King Worm, who is now incredibly shriveled up] Had enough... destabilization?
King Worm:  I don't... [Coughs] ...know what you're talking about...
Clown:  I'm a clown!
King Worm:  Well, that's that.
King Worm:  I don't feel so good.
Finn:  GET OUT OF MY HOUSE, KING WORM! [King Worm groans and exits.] [To Jake] Is it really you... this time?
Jake:  Yeah, mans. Actual Jake.
Finn:  Cool... [Pinching Jake] Pinch.
Jake:  Ow, man, come on!
Finn:  I'm just checkin'! ...Just checkin'.
