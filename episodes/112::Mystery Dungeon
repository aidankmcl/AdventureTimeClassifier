Tree Trunks:  Shelby. Shelby, wake up.
Shelby:  [Wakes up confused and dazed.] Where am I? Tree Trunks, what's going on?!
Tree Trunks:  Uh, you've been snoozing on my dome. I just woke up in this room with these fellas: Nectar, Ice Cream, and one of the Lemoncarbs.
Lemongrab: Awake. [starts turning his head around.] Avast, hold tight your buns, if buns you do hold dear; for time has come to wake and run and not give way to fear!
Tree Trunks:  What are those awful words?
Lemongrab:  [turns his head to the wall and to the normal direction.] I'm reading the wall. [Points to the wall.] They are wall words.
Tree Trunks:  Beyond this room are a thousand rooms, outside of them still more.
Shelby:  Behind each door, on every floor, danger, danger, ever more.
Neptr:  Stranger, hark! The traps galore may kill you whilst you do explore. To free yourself - [waits for Ice King to start reading.]
Ice King:  [Writing something in a book.] Huh? Oh. Now where were we? To free yourself from this tomb, and nevermore re-enter, find the room amidst the rooms that lies exactly center?
Shelby:  It's a map!
Lemongrab:  I no longer need this map. I have infallible recall.
Tree Trunks:  Oh! The room is trying to hug us! [She jumps through a door which leads to a bottomless chasm.] Oh no!
Ice King:  Oh, dag.
Neptr:  Check out my mods, bro. [Neptr extends his arm and grabs Tree Trunks and pulls her in.]
Lemongrab:  Enough of this! [Opens a latch on the floor which was the latch for a trapdoor which they all fall through.]
Ice King:  Huh? This room doesn't have any doors. 
Tree Trunks:  W- We're trapped!
Lemongrab:  [groans] This is wrong. The map lied to me-e. It doesn't want me to find the EXIT! Ice King, h-how do you taste?
Ice King:  Uh, nice, I guess? 
Lemongrab:  Mild or SPICY?!
Ice King:  Oh, uh - [has a flashback of himself kissing his hand in front of Gunter.] Kinda lonely.
Lemongrab:  Make yourself into food! Now!
Ice King:  You're going to eat me? Yeah, right.
Neptr:  Slop your mouths up. I have found an oven and baking supplies. 
Tree Trunks:  I can make an apple pie for all of us.
Lemongrab:  Make them fast, servile.
Tree Trunks:  If you want a taste of my juicy apple pie you better be nice. You got that?
Lemongrab:  I am sorry. Make pies, slave.
Tree Trunks:  Okay, that's better, now let's see about this pie business.
Tree Trunks:  All right, gentlemen. Have a look at my luscious, gooey apple pie.
Lemongrab:  No! [he punches the rat, possibly killing it and starts eating the pie out of the rat's mouth.] Acceptable.
Shelby:  Uh, Lemongrab?
Lemongrab:  WHAT?!
Shelby:  Never mind.
Ice King:  Come on, you guys. That mouse showed us the room door.
Ice King:  [to Neptr] Say, you know what's weird?
Neptr:  What, Papi?
Ice King:  Well, isn't it weird how Tree Trunks' ability to make pies is specifically what helped us escape from that room?
Neptr:  I make pies, too, Papi.
Ice King:  Right, yeah, like, battery pies or summin'? [laughs]
Neptr:  No. Real pies. Don't you remember? I am your s- [gets cut off by Ice King.]
Ice King:  Hey! Look, another room!
Ice King:  Good grief, it's humid in here.
Lemongrab:  That door will lead us closer to the exit!
Ice King:  Hold up, hold up! [He grabs Lemongrab's arm and pulls him away from the pool.] Look! [He points at the fish monster, that has a plug chained to his tail. It's plugged up to a hole so the water wouldn't escape.]
Ice King:  There has to be a way to get across without that thing chompin' our WOO-HOOS!
Neptr:  Can't you fly us across, Papi?
Ice King:  Oh yeah, I can sure try.
Ice King:  Nggh! Aw dang, this heat is negating my powers! Can't do nothin' with this steam coming off the water. [Ice King sticks his hand in the water]
Ice King:  NGH, glob! Fah! [He attempts using his ice powers on it but he fails.] Nagh! Look at this! [He does a raspberry with a disapproving face.] Well, that's it. Show's over. I'll just die here and y'all can eat my body if you want to survive.
Tree Trunks:  Golly, how we ever gonna worm our way out of this... fishy situation?
Shelby:  I think I have an idea.
Shelby:  That's a girl, Tree Trunks! You can do it!
Shelby:  [sighs] This is gonna work out just fine.
Tree Trunks:  Oh, that's warm on my undercarriage.
Ice King:  H-help me guys!
Neptr:  Yes, Papi! [He approaches him and pinches his knee.]
Ice King:  NNGH! Lemongrab, c'mon!
Tree Trunks:  Bleh! Wow, that was heavy, man.
Tree Trunks:  Aw yeah, I've been reborn!
Neptr:  Look! [He points at the path leading to the door. The rest of the water has escaped.]
Tree Trunks:  Let's go then!
Neptr:  Papi, no! [He releases a pie from his microwave, and he gets hit by a tentacle too.] Ouchies!
Tree Trunks:  Look out,  Shelby!
Lemongrab:  WOOAH! WUOAGH!
Lemongrab:  OUGHF! MY JUICE!! MY VITAL JUICES!!!
Lemongrab:  MOMMY!!!
Lemongrab:  The hidden door! Hohuugh.. [He falls to the ground, looking floppy and thin.]
Lemongrab:  My vital essence depleted... Must.. replenish...
Tree Trunks:  Oh, step back, you all. [Tree Trunks approaches Lemongrab and inserts her trunk into his mouth. She then blows. Some lemon juice squirts out of him.]
Shelby:  Ugh!
Ice King:  Ew.
Lemongrab:  Nugh.. That'll do, Slave Trunks. To the spiraling ledge! [He points at the exit of the room.]
Ice King:  We almost there, Lemongrab?
Lemongrab:  Yes.
Shelby:  Faster, TT!
Tree Trunks:  Don't criticize my running, Shelby.
Lemongrab:  This door leads to the center exit!
Neptr:  The door is secured with an esoteric encryption system.
Ice King:  Well that's okay, 'cause you can hack the mainframe or whatever, right BMO?
Neptr:  I'm not BMO, I'm your son Neptr. I-I throw pies.
Ice King: Ohhhs! I grabbed the wrong robot! [starts muttering angerly.] Dang! Nuts face!
Shelby:  Uhhh ... what is going on here Ice King?
Tree Trunks:  Yes, I'm getting a weird feeling in my stomach, and I think it's 'cause of you, Mr. Wizard you'd better fess up to whatever you're doing. [Cuts to Ice King looking around] I got no time for nobody dancing around and acting fool at my expense. [Cuts to scenes of the others looking around as she speaks] I'm Tree Trunks and people know I'm kind and honest, that's why people like me. [Cuts to Ice King writing in his book again]
Ice King:  Huh? Wha-wha-what's she sayin'?
Tree Trunks:  So stop sellin' fib-bibs and give it straight! [Pointing at Ice King with her trunk]
Ice King:  [Closes book] Grrrr! All right! I knocked you all out and brought you here!
Ice King:  [Puts the book inside his beard] I'm sorry, but I had to do it. Each of you possess the exact qualities to pass the various tests of this dungeon: Tree Trunks with your baking skills; [cuts to Tree Trunks] Lemongrab with your lemony-juicy... [cuts to Lemongrab]
Lemongrab:  Essence.
Ice King:  Yeah... [cuts to Shelby] Shelby, who should've been the bait for the fish.
Shelby:  Yeah..but no, thanks. [cuts to Neptr]
Ice King:  And..BMO, who should've been here instead of this weird piece of junk that I don't remember nothin' about. [Neptr looks ashamed, slowly gets off the screen] Ahhh, I failed!
Neptr:  Father! Look at me. [Neptr proceeds to throw a pie he just baked at the door, it makes short circuit-like sounds and opens up to them, Ice King is amused]
Neptr:  Are you happy with me now, Papi?
Ice King:  [Laughs somewhat maniacally] Yes! Yes! Oh, my son! [Grabs and hugs Neptr, he seems happy] The grand prize of my loins!
Ice King:  Now you see why I needed to bring you all here. Behold! The Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving!
Tree Trunks:  What's it do?
Ice King:  Whatever goes in the Magi's flames..comes to life, anything at all!
Tree Trunks:  Uh, like an ashtray?
Ice King:  [Looking extremely rejoiced] Yes! Isn't it amazing?!
Shelby:  [Annoyed] Uh..You should've told us! I would've freaking brought something!
Ice King:  Do not be sad. Because I brought the ultimate thing! [shows them his book] This.
Neptr:  Your journal?
Ice King:  Except..it's not my journal! [flips it] It's my Fionna & Cake fan-fiction! [Shelby stares at him with contempt] All my brilliant fantasies will now be real. [Ice King looks at the blue flames that surround the Magi wearing an expression of silly hope] Fionna, Cake, Marshall Lee; they'll all be living, breathing beings, just like me.
Lemongrab:  [robotic tone] You serve no function, you must be destroyed! [Ice King throws the book in the flames and the Magi grabs it as Lemongrab attacks Ice King with his sound sword] [A wall of flames rises and Ice King gets up, his beard is gone]
Ice King:  Yes! Yes! [A very dumb crossed-eyed book with arms and legs comes out of the flames]
Book:  Woo, hahaha, yeah! [Farts]
Ice King:  [Ice King looks more than disappointed] No..NO! Another cruel joke on my life! [Ice King collapses onto ground, the book approaches him and starts jumping on him, the flames around the Magi start to dissipate and he opens his eyes]
Ice King:  Oh, good..you're awake, you bum. Look what you did..[Ice King points at the Magi, the Magi looks annoyed, the book says something] Get out of my Face! Yeah, yeah Get out! [The Magi goes flying out of a hole up in the chamber as Ice King threatens him with his fist]
Finn:  [Serious] This is the spot? Right here? [The Magi comes out of the ground, Finn and Jake don't see him] What was that?!
Tree Trunks:  C'mon Ice Cream. We-we're leavin' [The book farts on Ice King, he is lying on the ground]
Ice King: [Reluctantly] OK.
Jake:  [Sniffs] I'm tellin' you dude, my pie-dar's goin' 'nay-nays. [Sniffs]
Jake:  Oww!
Book:  Write in me!
Finn:  What the--This is very strange.
Jake:  TT! Where is the pie at?! [Shelby gets off Tree Trunks]
Tree Trunks:  Oh, Mister Lemoncarb ate it.
Lemongrab:  [Quickly] Bye, don't follow me. [Lemongrab leaves]
Shelby:  Hey, Jake can I catch you a ride back home?
Jake:  Yeah, but what the heck is goin' on here? [Points at Ice Kng that is behind him, sitting on the grass and holding the book]
Shelby:  Ice King was doin' some... desperate business, but it didn't work out. [Neptr approaches Ice King] He seems pretty bummed out 'bout it.
Neptr:  Don't be sad, Papi. Your characters can always be real in the garden of your mind.
Ice King:  [Holds Neptr's hand] They can? [Wears that expression of silly hope again]
Neptr:  Remember when you showed me your imagination zone?
Ice King:  Yes! Yes, if I can concentrate... [closes eyes]
Ice King:  [Laughs] It worked!
Fionna:  [Speaking with Neptr's voice] I missed you, Ice King!
Ice King:  Oh, Fionna, can dreams be real as waking life?
Fionna:  Of course they can! Dreams are real!
Ice King:  Then I will wait for you, from across the threshold of consciousness.
Neptr:  Our worlds will surely meet, Ice King.
Ice King:  [Blushing with his eyes closed] I, too, feel this; and it feels so strong it must be true.
Finn:  [Ice King keeps talking to himself waving his hands while holding the book, book says something] Who in this world is sadder than the Ice King?
Shelby:  [Ice King keeps rambling on] Me, watching this.
Book:  [flailing hands around] Yeah! Write it down! Write it down!
