Marceline:  Thanks for helping me record, Finn.
Finn:  No problem, Marceline.
Marceline:  Now, I'm gonna sing something really personal, so don't laugh at me.
Finn:  I would never dream of it... m'lady. [Laughs]
Marceline:  Now, start a slow beat, and keep it steady, or it'll mess up everything.
Finn:  You got it!
Marceline:  Huh? Finn, you messed the beat up!
Finn:  Marceline, if you're thinkin' about your dad so much, then... why don't you go see 'im?
Marceline:  [Strums guitar] He's not worth the effort.
Finn:  Not worth what effort?
Marceline:  Well... first, I'd have to draw a circle with a happy face in the center and then... uh... douse it with bug milk.
Finn:  [Finn finishes drawing the face] Oh, yeah?! [Goes to grab some bug milk, then returns to throw it on the face; the bug milk gets absorbed by the face.]
[Note: Marceline is not paying attention to Finn's actions.]
Marceline:  [Sighs] And then you're supposed to chant something like [The happy face glows and the candles next to it light up], "Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum." [Finn laughs and the face changes color.] But... I-I don't really wanna see him. I'm still mad about the thing with the fries. [Marceline notices a strange noise and finally looks at Finn.] Huh?!
Finn:  Wwwwhhhat?! [The room changes color drastically; a portal to the Nightosphere opens where the face was.] Whoa... whoa!! Aaagh!!
Lord of Evil:  Marceline!
Marceline:  Finn... what the heck did you do?!
Finn:  I... reunited you with your family?
Lord of Evil:  Is this kid your evil servant?
Finn:  I'm not evil, Marceline's dad. I'm super good!
Lord of Evil:  "Super good?" [Roars]
Finn:  [Gasps; Lord of Evil grabs Finn, and begins sucking energy from him.] What're you doing?!
Lord of Evil:  Stealing your soul.
Marceline:  Dad! [Separates the two] Ugh! You always do stuff like this!
Lord of Evil:  Haha! Oh, Marceline! I never know what's gonna set you off! Whoa! Is this the family ax?
Marceline:  Wha--? HEY!!!
Lord of Evil:  Did you turn it into some kind of lute?
Marceline:  [Yelling in anger] Give it back, and get out!!!
Lord of Evil:  Okay, I'll go. I've got business to attend to, anyway--sucking up all the souls in Oooooo...
Finn:  [Stammering] WHA--Gh--NO!!
Lord of Evil:  See you kids later! [Opens door]
Marceline:  My bass!
Finn:  I've unleashed evil onto Ooo ! We've gotta stop 'im, Marceline!
Marceline:  Fine... but I'm only coming with you to get my bass back.
Finn:  Hey! How do I kill this guy, anyway?
Marceline:  Finn! You can't kill my dad!
Finn:  Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean--
Marceline:  No! You literally can't kill my dad! He's deathless!
Finn:  Oh...
Fluffy Person:  [The Lord of Evil's shadow falls upon him and he stops running.] Huh? [Camera zooms out to show the Lord of Evil.] Who the fluff are you?
Lord of Evil:  Um... Well, I'm sure not the guy who's gonna suck out your soul.
Fluffy Person:  Good 'cause that's, like, my number one fear.
Lord of Evil:  Really!? Well... I know a little exercise for that! Wanna try??
Fluffy Person:  Wow...
Lord of Evil:  First... close your eyes.
Fluffy Person:  Okay! [Gets pounded by the ax bass.] AAH! You coulda killed me!
Lord of Evil:  Ah, but I didn't! And now, aren't you thrilled just to be alive?
Fluffy Person:  Yeah, I guess... So what?
Lord of Evil:  So... This next part will be all the more... horrifying. [Laughs maniacally as his transformed face moves towards the screen, sucking the fluffy person's soul. Scene goes back to Finn and Marceline.]
Finn:  There!! Below us! A gathering of Fluffy People! May-haps they've seen your father! Marceline... release the Finn-bomb! [Marceline drops him and he whistles to mimic a bomb falling; Marceline catches him before he reaches the ground and he makes an explosion noise. He notices the Fluffy People shivering.] They're all freaked out!
Marceline:  It's because they're scared of him. [Camera pans over to the Fluffy Person from earlier. He is floating and moaning. Marceline examines him.] Hm. My dad's been here. Come on. Let's go.
Finn:  No! We gotta help this guy. I've got some soul food that Jake packed for me. You like, uh, collard greens or country-fried steak?
Marceline:  Look. You wanna help him? Help me get my bass back.
Finn:  How will that help hi--?
Marceline:  MY DAD STOLE MY BASS GUITAR, FINN!! And when I get it back... I'm gonna break it over his neck and slam my dad back into the Nightosphere!
Finn:  Oh, clam! But first you gotta return the souls your dad sucked back to these sad, little husks. Right, Marceline?
Marceline:  [Blows tuft of hair away from her face] Uh, sure, yeah, yeah, we'll do that.
Head Marauder:  So I popped his head like a cork! And I says, "That's what I think of Expanding Earth Theory!"
Lord of Evil:  Alright.
Marauders:  Huh?!
Lord of Evil:  I've got a joke, too. [It's revealed that he sucked Marauder #14's soul. The Lord of Evil pushes him off the chair.] What wears a dark suit, is completely evil, and is about to suck out all your souls?
Head Marauder:  Yo mama!
Lord of Evil:  [Beat] That's right! I'm your mama! [Sucks the marauders' souls]
Marceline:  Red Rock Pass. If my dad wants to get through the mountains, he'll have to come through here.
Finn:  We can work together! And smash 'im with this rock! And once he's smooshed, all the souls will go back to their rightful bods.
Lord of Evil:  So, finally taking a run at your old man, huh?
Marceline:  [Losing patience] Daddy...
Lord of Evil:  [Chuckles] Karate kick!! [Kicks Marceline off his shoulders; she lands on the ground hissing.]
Finn:  Marceline!! Keep 'im right there!! HrrrrRAAAAGH!!!
Lord of Evil:  Karate chop!! [He chops her; she hisses.] You can't destroy me!
Marceline:  [Hisses] [Calming down] No... D-dad... I-I don't wanna destroy you... [Angered] Look, just... stay out of my life!! [Floats away]
Lord of Evil:  You're not even alive!
Finn:  You blew it, dude. We're supposed to be a team--a team whose sport is stop-your-dad-from-suckin'-souls... ball.
Marceline:  [Sighs] I just want my dad to care about me.
Lord of Evil:  Of all history's greatest monsters, you are by far the most evil thing I've encountered. Offer your soul to me, dark one.
Gunter:  Wenk wenk.
Lord of Evil:  NO! You can't have my soul! I don't even...! Look, just get in here.
Gunter:  Wenk wenk.
Lord of Evil:  [Kicks penguin away] Keep your crummy soul!
Ice King:  Gunter! Who told you you could fly?!
Gunter:  [Pointing at Lord of Evil] Wenk.
Ice King:  Huh? No one sucks the life from my penguins except me! ...And maybe polar bears, because that's just nature, Gunter. [Flies over to Lord of Evil] You darest encroach upon my domain?! [Lord of Evil's face changes.] You've raised my frosty dander! And for that, I shall-- [Lord of Evil shows Ice King his terrifying face.] AAAAAOOOOOHHH!! I've soiled my tunic... completely by choice! [Flies away]
Lord of Evil:  YES!!
Finn:  Aw, man! He's growing huge!
Finn:  I'm gonna take 'im down!
Marceline:  Finn, you're like an ant to him.
Finn:  Oh, yeah? Well, this ant's about to get in his pants!
Marceline:  [Deadpan, amused] What?
Finn:  [Stammers, embarrassed] You know! [Picking up Sword of the Dead] Because I'm going to make him uncomfortable while I release those souls! RAAAAAAAAGH!!! [Climbs up Lord of Evil's body] Give up those souls, Marceline's dad! In the name of justice!!
Lord of Evil:  Huh? [Not noticing Finn] Oh, Marceline. Still following me?
Marceline:  I'll stop following you if you give me back my guitar!
Lord of Evil:  [Flicks Finn off with ease] No, Marceline.
Finn:  [Flying upwards] NO ONE FLICKS ME IN THE BUTT WITHOUT MY CONSENT!!! [Descends and stabs the Lord of Evil in the head. Lord of Evil smiles at Finn and reveals his second, monster-like head. He falls while screaming and grabs hold of a tentacle. Lord of Evil tries to shake Finn off but he won't let go. Finn is grunting and screaming all the while.] Whoooaa!! [Lord of Evil stops shaking.] The souls... Lumpy Space Princess! He got your soul, too?!
Lumpy Space Princess:  What? Nah. I totally saw Hot Dog Princess get sucked in here, and I wasn't invited?! I was all, "What the lump?" so I'm crashin' this party!
Finn:  Well, I'll save you... I'LL SAVE ALL OF YOU!!
Marceline:  IN YOUR FACE, DAD!
Lord of Evil:  Give back that ax, Marceline! You don't respect it enough!
Marceline:  Well... you don't respect anything! Dad!! DAD!! I'm outta here!
Finn:  BUT--!!
Lord of Evil:  Fine!! Go!! I'm too busy sucking to deal with you!
Finn:  NO, WAIT! Marceline!! Keep talking to 'im! When he's talking, he can't steal souls!!
Marceline:  I said I'm outta here!
Finn:  [To himself and digging around in his backpack] Diversion... need... diversion. [He gasps, pulls out the Walkman and plays the song he and Marceline recorded earlier. Both Marceline and her father stop dead in their tracks. Marceline blushes and her father turns around.]
Lumpy Space Princess:  Oh, my Glob, you guys! Drama bomb!
Lord of Evil:  Marceline, do you really feel this way?
Marceline:  Dad, I...
Lord of Evil:  Marceline... of course I love you.
Marceline:  Dad...
Lord of Evil:  I'm sorry I ate your fries. I didn't mean to hurt you.
Marceline:  It's okay, Dad. It's... it's really okay.
Lord of Evil:  No, it's not okay. They weren't even very good. They were really cold. I love you, Marceline. Don't you ever doubt that.
Marceline:  I love you, too, Dad.
Lord of Evil:  [Tearing up] Oh, Marceline, I am so--
Finn:  [Flying through the air] YALALALALALALALALALALALALA!!!!!
Finn:  MALOSO VOBISCUM ET CUM SPIRITUM!! [Lord of Evil is transported back to the Nightosphere.] [Low, growling voice] I'll see you in the Nightosphere, ya sick freak. [Marceline gasps] YES!!!!
Marceline:  Finn!! How could you do that?!
Finn:  How could I... save the day?
Marceline:  How could you embarrass me like that and then stab my dad?!
Finn:  How could I embarrass-save you?? [Marceline attempts to ax Finn.] WHOA! Marceline!
Marceline:  [Sighs] I'm glad he's back in the Nightosphere. That was emotionally exhausting.
Finn:  I'm also exhausted emotionally. Or... wait. I mean, I mean physically.
Marceline:  I've been meaning to ask you... What's with that pocket on your shirt?
Finn:  Oh, Jake's in here. 'Sup, Jake?
