Finn & Jake: Willy! Willy! Oh, Willy!
Princess Bubblegum: Sh! There it is. The weeping Willy. [she puts a glass under Willy and pokes it with a stick so that it drops sap] One drop of its rare sap can flavor an entire stock pot of soup.
Clone James: [running] Danger, danger! Whoop whoop! Loose gravel!
Princess Bubblegum: James?
Clone James: Look out princess! [while making her fall to the ground] Poot poot poot shooh!
Princess Bubblegum:  [upon touching the ground] Ow!
Clone James:  [falling and screaming]
Princess Bubblegum, Finn & Jake:  [shouting] James!
Clone James: Remember me! [he reaches the river he was falling in]
Princess Bubblegum: Oh, not this again.
Time card: 3 months ago
James: I'm registering mondo mega rads down there.
Jake: [stuttering]
Finn: Huh? [turns around, seeing lots of monsters climbing on the vehicle's windshield.] Oh, my garf! What are they?!
Princess Bubblegum: They're toxic creatures, from another time.
Jake: [scared] It can't end like this.
Finn: [shouting] James!
Finn: I wanted to do it. Why didn't you let me?
Princess Bubblegum: Someone was going to have to eat the big one to save the others.
Princess Bubblegum: And even though he is gone, and it's super sad, I would like to honor James... With this new James I whipped up in the lab!
Clone James: Jeet!
Princess Bubblegum: Here you go, James [pins on him a Medal of Valor] an award for bravery. Let's hear it for James! [claps]
Candy People: [cheering]
Finn: Wow. James sacrificed his life for you again, PB.
Jake: Yeah, that's like the twenty-fifth time, right?
Finn: Yeah, obviously we'll have to re-clone him.
Jake: Totes.
Princess Bubblegum: Now hold up. This ground is perfectly solid. [Princess Bubblegum jumps a few times.] There's no loose gravel here.
Jake: So what? Clone him up, girl.
Princess Bubblegum: James is too reckless. I can't reward this kind of foolish behavior forever. It's time James takes his eternal nap.
Finn: But it's James!
Jake: Come P-Gum, don't be all cold-hearty!
Princess Bubblegum: I'm putting my foot down. There will be no more Jameses.
Finn: No...
Princess Bubblegum: I'm sorry. Look, I need you guys to go to James's apartment and box up his stuff.
Jake: [later, in the Candy Kingdom] And remember the time James saved PB from that contaminated cupcake?
Finn: Yeah, he ate that whole cupcake. What a guy...
Finn: [Upon entering James' apartment, he sees plenty of Jameses partying] Is this... James heaven?
Jake: [shouting] Jameses! [all the Jameses stop dancing] Alright, who's in charge here?
Finn: James...
James II: Uh, I'm James number 2. The original James got all goopy in the desert.
Jake: Explain this biz, James II.
James II: Well... I was lonely! I knew Princess Bubs would make a new James if, you know, a James died a hero. So...
Finn: You faked your own death?
James II: Yeah! I just wanted a friend. [James II grabs another James] Someone who gets me!
Finn: James...
James II: Plus, each time I get kerplonked, I get another shiny medal, and why have two medals if you can have all the medals? Medals, medals, medals...
Finn: Dude, I've been to your funeral like twenty-five times.
James II: What? The medals make me happy. Plus, PLUS! It's a constant party here in [James II turns around] Jamestown!
Jake: [whispering to Finn] PB ain't gonna like this.
Finn: Hmm hmm!
James II: Wait, don't tell her! I'll give you a medal.
Jake: Nah, man. PB's no dummy. She'll find out. It's only a matter of time.
Finn: We like you James but, you're on your own. We're gonna sit this one out.
Finn: This should be good.
Jake: There's Princess Bubblegum!
Princess Bubblegum: [shouting] Hey! Stop running! You rascals, get back here! You are all in so much trouble! [shouting again] James!
Jake: [laughs] What a show!
Finn: Very enjoyable!
Princess Bubblegum: [to the banana guards] Okay, who's the Banana Guard Leader for this week?
Banana Guard Leader: I'm the leader.
Princess Bubblegum: This picture should help you find the Jameses.
Banana Guard Leader: Hey guys, it's the picture of one of the perpetrators. Take a good look.
Banana Guards: Ooooh!
Princess Bubblegum: There's twenty-five of them.
Banana Guard Leader: I need to see the other twenty-four pictures.
Princess Bubblegum: Nope, you only need that one.
Banana Guard Leader: What? How can one picture identify twenty-five perpetrators?
Princess Bubblegum: It's because they all look the same.
Banana Guard Leader: Oh okay, I see. There's twenty-five of them! They all look like this guy!
Banana Guard I: Huh, how can twenty-five guys look like one guy? You mean they're viginti-quintuplets?
Banana Guard Leader: You mean they're viginti-quintuplets?
Princess Bubblegum: No! They're clones.
Banana Guard Leader: What are clones?
Princess Bubblegum: [sighs then speaks very fast] A group of organisms or cells produced asexually from one ancestor or stock, to which they are genetically identical.
Banana Guard II: How did that happen?
Princess Bubblegum: It's a long story.
Banana Guard Leader: I love long stories.
Princess Bubblegum: Aaah! There's no time!
Banana Guard Leader: And they're not brothers?
Princess Bubblegum: No! They're not brothers, they're clones!
Princess Bubblegum: [shouting] Hey! Get down here and help me! [Finn and Jake indicate to her to go see them and she sighs] Viginti-quintuplets! I'm telling you...
Princess Bubblegum: What are you doing? Why aren't you helping?
Jake: Come on PBs, just sit here with us for five minutes.
Princess Bubblegum: Why?
Jake: Come on! Five minutes!
Princess Bubblegum: Maybe just a brick.
Banana Guard Leader: [to one of the Jameses who's walking in front of them] Hey you, stop!
Clone James I: Yeah?
Banana Guard Leader: Have you seen this guy?
Clone James I: Hmm...
Princess Bubblegum: [cluckles] I have to admit, it's fun to watch.
Banana Guard Leader: [when seeing two other Jameses] You two stop too! [to the first James] Show them the picture!
Clone James I: Alright.
Banana Guard Leader: Have you guys seen this guy?
Clone James II&III: Hmm...
Banana Guard Leader: Let me see that picture again.
Clone James I: [gives it to them] Here you go.
Banana Guard Leader: Hmm... Hmm... [to Clone James I] What's your name?
Clone James I: James.
Banana Guard Leader: [pointing to a random James with their finger] What's your name?
Clone James IV: James.
Clone James V: [when the Banana guard leader points to him] James.
Clone James VI: [when the Banana guard leader points to him] James.
Banana Guard Leader: You're all named James. Is it because you guys look alike?
Clone James VI: I guess so.
Banana Guard Leader: Y'know, I was telling this to the guys... If, if we look alike, we should have the same name. It would just make it a little easier. Life, that is. It would make our life a little easier. [crying] Aah... Give me a second... [wipes the tear] Same name... Look alike... You really look alike... Brothers! You're all brothers?
Clone James VI: No... I don't think so.
Banana Guard Leader: [counting the Jameses] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven-
Clone James VI: Twenty-five. If you're counting how many of us look alike, there's twenty-five.
Banana Guard Leader: Hmm... Twenty-five... Not brothers... [They remember Princess Bubblegum saying No, they're not brothers, they're clones! to them.] [to the other banana guards] I think these are the twenty-five that are not brothers. [shouting] Perpetrators! Get to them! [The banana guards start running after the Jameses and Princess Bubblegum, Finn and Jake laugh again.]
Banana Guard II: [Four Jameses hide in a glove shop from four banana guards.] Where they'd go?
The four Banana Guards: [The four Jameses leave the shop wearing gloves but the gloves fall on the ground] It's them!
The four Jameses: Whoop whoop!
Banana Guards: Gotcha!
Jameses: Aww!
Princess Bubblegum: [She, Finn and Jake walk to the Jameses]Okay, fun's over. You're not heroes! [rips off James II's medals] You don't deserve these medals.
James II: Wah, no fair.
Gumball Guardian: Evil presence detected! Evil! [A horde of goo monsters run towards the Candy Kingdom]
Princess Bubblegum: Protect the kingdom!
Banana Guards: Okay! Weeoo weeoo weeoo weeoo... [starts advancing on the goo monsters. Gumball Guardians shoot lasers out of there eyes and obliterates one of the goo monsters. A Banana Guard fakes their death by putting a spear on his body and lies down] Ah! Can't fight! [Finn comes and takes the spear]
Finn: Yoink!
Banana Guard: Hey!
Finn: Heeyah![he attempts stabbing one of the goo monsters with a spear, but the spear melts on contact]Aww! Don't touch the monsters! They'll melt you![a Banana Guard tries to poke a goo monster, and run away after hearing Finn. Banana Guards run into the castle. Finn spots a bunch of candy orphans] Oh my jerbs! Jake! Let's help these candy orphans! [He runs to the bunch of candy orphans] Hey kids! [He picks up an orphan and kicks it into the kingdom. Jake stretches his arms to put the orphans into the kingdom]
Gumball Guardian: Evil! [Goo monsters attempt to climb over the kingdom walls but are obliterated by Gumball Guardian's lasers]
James II: Man, we do deserve them medals. It's not like she can give them to someone else. I wrote my name on all of them.
Clone James: Yeah, so did I. [Princess Bubblegum screams]
James II: Princess!
Princess Bubblegum: [a goo monster is walking toward her, and she gasps] The original James?
James II: James are a heroes! See? [he jumps on the original James] Vrow-w-w-w!
Clone James: Yeah, I'm-a save the day! [he jumps on the monster too]
Clone James: I, as well! [he jumps on the monster too]
Clone James: For the good of the many! [he jumps on the monster too]
Clone James: Check out my selfless act! [he jumps on the monster too]
Clone James: Me, too! So selfless! [he jumps on the monster too]
Clone James: All for one, and one for James! [He jumps on the monster too. At this point, every James have jumped and turned into a pile of candy which then turned into a candy people made out of the Jameses.]
Jake: Mother of Grob!
Jameses: We told you we were heroes!
Princess Bubblegum: I hereby award thee...Jameses...These medals for bravery.
Finn: Dat's my boi, Jameses!
Princess Bubblegum: Now for your new assignment, Jameses. Go unto the Wastelands, and never come back.
Clone James: What-a-wha...?
Princess Bubblegum: Do it, and I'll send you a medal every day.
Jameses: Yay!
Clone James: Come on, every-James!
Jameses: [chanting and running toward the Wastelands] Medals! Medals! Medals! Medals! Medals!
Princess Bubblegum:  [sighs] I'm not gonna miss him.
