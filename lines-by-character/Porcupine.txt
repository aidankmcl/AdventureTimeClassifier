Oh, well hello there my friend. What are you doing?
Oh, well maybe I can help!  Sit on me.
Well sit on my needles and the shock will boost you high up into the air!  Sit on me, its okedo-its fine, go ahead.
You can do it if you believe in yourself! Sit on me.
Oooh, alriight, I'll shooow you!
Sorry! I thought that would work.    I'm just no help at all.
