Hey! What are you doing? No people or money allowed in the fountain, ya dums! Where's your sense at?!
Fellas, goofing in a public fountain is punishable by a lashing, and you're trying to bribe me.
Ooh! Now that's what I'm talking about, fellas.   Have a good time in the fountain.
Hey, no furniture or meat in the fountain! You'll wreck up the water!
You can't buy me off twice, fellas.
Ah, maybe you can, fellas, maybe you can.
Hold it! No dancing in the streets without a permit!
Hey, you can't talk to me like that.
All right, I'm going!
Oh, no! Aah!
