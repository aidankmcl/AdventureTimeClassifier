I will get you!Yeah, and what about that peanut juice, Peanut Princess? My body needs juice!Hi, Finn.
What brings you by?
I understand.
Mm-hmm.
Trying to give you a hug.
Oh, I see. You want to take things slo-o-o-w.
Of course it looks bad. If I had beautiful, shiny hair, no one would look at my muscles.  Come back when you wanna get serious about loving me!
