Are you lemon?
Does your head come to a nub?
You are un-lemon.
I am Lemonjon. I see you made it past our Lemon mmmmmmmeringerie!
They're quite hungry.
There is no food, only Lemons--Lemons with bellies empty but for lemon lusts!
Mmmmmmmy senses tell me that they're in the dungeon. They've been there for three weeks. Three weeks, dungeon.
Whoa, hold the phone! What is this powerful new juice coursing fromst my core source?  The juice aches. Is this the rumored ache of feeling? The feeling of caring unknown to Lemons? New thoughts emerge! If I act, the Candy People will suffer. If I don't, the Lemon people will suffer. The greater good demands but one course only: that I dissolve the bonds uniting me and become component to all!
