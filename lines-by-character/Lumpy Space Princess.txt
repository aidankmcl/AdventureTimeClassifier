Let me go to this party...
Poor Finn. Don't you know?  Every party is my party.
Get out of my way, Finn.  Oh my glob, you're touching my woman body!
Everyone at the party get ready! 'Cause here comes the hot bunch of grapes!
Ahhhh... oh my gaaaah...
Everybody get ready...  to pay attention to me...
Everybody, hey! I'm here! Look at my bouq-Take me back to when my ex-boyfriend Brad still loved me!
Wha?
Give them to me.
You witch! Give them to me now!
You skunk!  You skunk! You skunk! You pretty skunk! You don't know heartache with the whole Candy Kingdom in love with your pretty bubblegum buns!
Glob!
I'm sorry-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y...  I'm sorry you're so  stupid.
Everyone in here is a loser. Nobody's as good as Brad. Oh, Brad! Why can't I get over you?
This isn't a movie, Charlie, it's real life!
What?
Everyone knows me. I'm Lumpy Space Princess.
Ugly Johnnie?
Yeah, but I can't call you that anymore! Come on, sit up straight. Lemme see them eyes.
Do it.
Nope. Can't call you that anymore.  So, what brings you to the Candy Kingdom, Johnnie?
Mm-hmm.
That's so cool. You're like your own boss or whatever.
Why, Johnnie?
That's because you have poor posture.
You gotta stop slouching!
Now look me in the eye!
Yeah, stay like that.
You feeling good makes me feel good, Johnnie. So... where are you staying while you're in town?
Talk is cheap, Johnnie. You should take me there.
Johnnie, it's so nice. You've really made it your own.
Ooh, records!  Okay, wanna see something funny?
Okay. Okay.  Sit down!
Okay, are you ready?
Okay!
I know! That's the joke. My friend Melissa and I came up with that. You're smart that you get it.
I feel the same way, Johnnie.
What?
Johnnie...
Johnnie... go to bed already. You have a big day tomorrow.
Looking for someone?
'Course I am! Now make me some breakfast!
Okay, Johnnie, good luck at your meeting. And remember, I'll be right over there,  sending you good vibes while you're wowing Princess Bubblegum.
Johnnie's friend has so many movie channels.
Ha-ha, that movie was so dumb.  Oh, poop! Johnnie's meeting! I wonder how it went.
Johnnie! Oh, Johnnie, you're home! How'd it go? Oh, don't keep me in suspense, Johnnie!
Johnnie, that's wonderful!
I know!
Oh, my Glob! It's gonna be so nice to have dinner inside the castle. It's been a while.
What?!
So... Bubblegum thinks she can horn in on my territory? Sip from my soup after I cut all the onions?  Yo, think again, tranch.
Oh, Johnnie... Ugly Johnnie, through my tender love you have metamorphed into Beautiful Johnnie Butterfly.  Every relationship, I gamble with my heart. I go all in because the payoff is true love. I see you when I close my eyes, and thinking of you makes my mind feel light. All my problems fade away, and I can't help smiling. Heh. To let someone you love go into the arms of another takes a big person. I don't know... if I can be that big.  Rah!  Eh, ehh.
Hi, Johnnie.
I'm going to time-travel you back to when we first met at the tavernback to when you loved meso we can have a second chance.
Uh!
Johnnie? C'mon. Sit up straight. Let me see them eyes. Ha-ha. Uh.
What? But I sent him back.
Well, then where is he?
Then if he's gone, can you send me back...?
To before I met him so I won't have to remember this heartache?!
Do it. Do it!
You witch! Give them tohuh, wha? What? Where are we?
Don't touch me!  You pretty skunk! You don't know heartache with the whole Candy Kingdom in love with your bubblegum buns...!Aah! Watch it, Crab Princess!
You ain't my man, so why are you all up in my lumps?!
Yeah! Do it! Oh, my glob! Aah ha ha! Haa!
Finn.  Finn.  I saw this already!    I know all about your dirty deeds. Now it's Lumpy's turn to slump those lips! Bring it in, baby.
Wha? Where you going?
WhaWhat?! I didn't wait infinity for a dip in the kiddie pool! We're taking this to the deep end!
Don't be scared, Finn. Lumpy's on lifeguard duty.
What the lump? Oh, hey! Finn, you got your arm back!Ahh! Oh, my gosh! Leave me alone. All I said was you're ugly, which is totally true. Somebody help me! Oh no!No way. First, I'm gonna fall in love with one of those little guys, and then I'm gonna fall out of love, and then, I'm gonna totally fake-die of a fake heart attack!  OH! MY HEART! MY HEART HURTS BECAUSE I FELL OUT OF LOVE! AND NOW I HAVE TO DIE! OOOOHHHHH!!!
Not yet, Cinnamon Bun!
One last kiss before dying, my love.  Farewell forever. Oh, oh, my heart! Waaah!Everyone's worthless at this talent show. I'm totally gonna win when I sing,  These lumps! I know you wanna slump up on these lumps! But you can't 'cause you're a chump! A chuuump!
Now it's time for me to kill it!

Mmm... Oh, Glob...
Awesome.  Totally nailed the interview.

Yuck.  Looks like I'll have to bust out these cobras to get a better dinner.  Hey, Finn...  You got anything better to eat??
Chapter 1: Gotcha!
G'night, you guys!   Finn is even more overpowered by my lumps than I thought. I guess at the end of the day, it's all about the lumps.
Oh, Turtle Princess! This book is coming out awesome!
Thanks, girl.
Goodnight, girl.
What's that?
What're you guys doing?
Oh, nuh-uh, I am not gonna carry rocks!
Ugh... Fine...  You're welcome, Finn.

Uuoohhh...  Turtle Princess, you can't call me! You're gonna blow my cover!
Good morning, girl.
Can't talk right now, girl!
This is way too boring for my book.  Oh... my shoulder strap... Oh, my orange juice is comin' out... Ha! GotchHuh?

Ugh! This place is plops, Finn!
Hey, Finn! Finn, my dress is slipping!!

I knew you couldn't resist me, Finn.  Oh, lump. I took it too far!  My powerful lumps have turned Finn into a grody monster! Get away, Finn! AAH, NO, AAAAAH!!!  OH, I CAN'T LOOK!  Aah!
That was so crazy! What just happened?!
Oh, Glob... I had to look because I looked so good!
Thanks for sayin' that stuff... and for saving me from those mirror-yous. That was pretty nice.
Okay. Time to write. Gonna make this... trashy. Turtle Princess'll be all,  Oh, my gosh! Number one best-seller! Hah... Yeah.   What's he doing out there?
Hello?
Oh... I'm working on it! I've been doing so much research!
Um... yeah...
Yeah... A book about how I'm hot, and Finn only wants... He's so... hot.  ...Finn has the hottest lumps, but his lumps are on the inside! YAAAAGH!!  HE'S GREAT!
I know, I
OH, MY GLOB!
Finn! You've probably been wondering where I've been for the last few hours!
Finn... I was never really your secretary, Finn. I was writing a book about how you were a slave to my lumps because I'm so hot, Finn!!
But you're the one who's hot, Finn!!
No... thank you.
Gotcha...Oh, my glob, Melissa. Ever since Clara stopped eating meat, her skin looks so good. I mean, she still looks fat, but like, I can't say that junk to her face.
I'm doing so awesome on my own. Like, right now, I found this can of beans.
Finn? Jake! Put down my stuff!
Melissa, I have to go. They got into my toilet paper. Melissa, I have to go!
Give it back, you guys!
Nooooooooo!
MY BEANS!!!
You guys ruined everything! I'm gonna kill you!I want surgery to make my body hot.
Yeah. I know I'm already pretty smokin'... but I bought this swimsuit, so I need a swimsuit body.
Aw, yeah! This body's hot! And powerful!  Huh?! Aw, what?!
Ohhhh...  What did you do to me??
No one thinks this look is hot!!
Huh?!What? Nah. I totally saw Hot Dog Princess get sucked in here, and I wasn't invited?! I was all, What the lump? so I'm crashin' this party!
Oh, my Glob, you guys! Drama bomb!Oh my gosh!  Hmm, yeah, guess what, Slime Princess is in the park, and she's, like, talking to a new nice king and he's, like, totally single.  By the way... don't tell anybody!
Hey, I'm here.
I can be smooth!  Finn, punch out my lumps.
I can be whatever he wants! I can change!
Yes! Hit me, hit me, hit me!
Are you serious?! Fine, I'll do it myself.
There, how's that? Better?
This is all your fault, Finn!  Aaaaaah!
Stop! We're not gonna let you beat up the Nice King.
We don't believe you!Aaah!  You guys, I'm bored out of my face! I make a motion to stop talking about dumb stuff that's lame!
It's not a box. It's a rotting log.
What?! I'm like a cool hippie!
The joke's on you because I wasn't invited. I'm crashing! And I already ate a bunch of your food! What you gonna do about it, Princess Egg Breath?
You didn't!  Don't touch me!
Lousy Breakfast Princess. Pamplemousse. What is that even?
Oh. Thanks?
Yeah, especially not from that gross pile of greasy hash! She lumpin' humiliated me!
You're bad.  And I like it!
This place is huge!
Gonna mess with Breakfast Princess, 'cause she called me pamplemousse.
Look. There. Breakfast Princess' room.
I'll show you, hon.  Ooh! Aah! Hey there!  Yeah, look over here!
That's for poisoning my girl.
I thought you were bad. Bad people don't stop.
Ugh. All her clothes are sticky.
That's messed up!  This'll teach Breakfast Princess.
I can't.
Uh..Hide where?
I got this.
Oh, glob.
A squirrel taught me how to do that.
Oh, glob, no. Not even.
For digging. Now start building a sand castle.  Don't stop digging or we'll know!
That was totally fun being bad with you, Marcy.
Do you think, like, doing all that bad stuff makes us...like, bad people?
Word.
Yeah, I feel kind of bad about that.
Yeah. Good call. IOh my glob!Oh, my gosh! How many times do I have to tell you? Somebody broke into my house and stole my lumps!
How am I supposed to calm down?! A lumping thief is out there getting fresh with my lumps!Yes!
Get those buns on the dance floor, girl!I'm bored, and I'm not having any fun.
That wasn't fun. That was lame.
I think by everyone saying whoopee the plan won't work cause he'll know we're faking it.
I'm gonna say something fun like Oh yeah, I'm having a fun time! Oh my gosh, havin' the best time I've ever had in my entire life!
Come on in here and party.
Oh yeah! Whoo! Woohoo!Oh, my gosh...
Oh, holy cow...
Oh! I feel so great!
Oh, my gosh! PB, ya gotta check out this super cute guy. You're gonna love 'im.
This is... Oh. Oh, my gosh. I don't even know your name.My name is Duchess Gummybuns.
What's the name on your invite?
Maybe he'll be a steaming hot babe with huge money.
Brad and I broke up a long time ago, duh!
No. Way.
Puke off!  You big donut!
No. I didn't do it, no.
He's DEAD!!!
I blinked by balls. My eye balls.
Oh it was Jake I knew it, I knew it was Jake.
Ew.
I'm DYING!
Ahhh!
Ugh, gross. My lumping body's all hollow now, I gotta put something in it.
So where's the food? What kind of castle is this? It's like a poor people's castle! With no lumping waffles for my dump truck!
Not my bod.
Oh yeah, right! I'm not the ghost! I was in the potty house.
Shah! As if you even know the answer to that, Jake!
IT'S NONE OF YOUR LUMPING BUSINESS!
Brad, he kissed me on the mouth! And I was like 'bleh-bleh-bleh', and then I was like 'Uh, gross. Go away, Brad' and he was like 'obviously you're not ready for me' but what does that even mean you guys? W-What does it lumping mean?
What do you want from me, Brad?! You said I was the hottest one, isn't that enough?!  Why'd you have to ...my mouth!
Aah! Don't touch me! Don't touch ME!
OH MY GLOB! I can't take this, you guys.  I'm calling my lumping parents right now!
Oh my Glob! I'm not ready! Get away!  Oh, gross!
I'm ready for you now, Brad. Isn't it so obvi? I'm so ready.Oh, no way. You guys made it!Finn, what the junk?
Oh, sandwiches!
No... I am the monster.
It's a long story.
It all started at my lumpin' parents' house.
Yeah?
They're lumpin' delicious, Mom.
No. You can have them delivered to me at my apartment.
What?!  You invited me here under false pretenses?!
Ha! Y'all don't think I can make it on my own? I'll show you! I'm running away!
I stormed out and left Lumpy Space forever.
No. Something else happened first. Keep listening.
I was so cold, and I was so very hungry.
Uh! Oh, Glob! Maybe I can... make a shelter out of these nuts!
It's not fair.
I was rescued by a family of wolves. The mama wolf was all like, We must take care of her, as if she were our own. And Papa Wolf was all like, This is a special child who needs special love because she's gonna be great when she grows up.
No, they were normal wolves. I knew what they were thinking because of their body language. Stop interrupting, Finn.
I found a home where I could act like myself.
They took care of me.
I knew that if my parents could see me now, they'd be jealous of how lumpin' awesome I am.
Oh, my Glob!
But then, the drama started.
Stephanie, Sue, can you guys keep a secret?  Okay, here's the secret: I just saw Jessica making out with Mark... behind Tony's back! Stephanie, are you even listening? 'Cause I'm kinda freaking out right now! Tony's gonna come back from hunting any minute now, and
Hi, Tony! Oh, my Glob. Guys, what are we gonna oh.
So, should we say something to Tony?
You guys!  TONY, JESSICA'S CHEATING ON YOU!
Oh, my Glob. Oh, my Glob. Oh, my Glob.
Look, I'm sorry. I know it's none of my business. I know, I
Because I think Tony has a right to know, Stephanie!
Nuh-uh, Miranda, I do not like Tony.
No, Jessica! Don't cheat on Tony with me!
Ah!  Oh, Glob!  Oh, no! Aah!    Oh, Glob.
I came upon a tribe of villagers.
Oh, I'm so hungry!
Ah!
Anyway, then I found this windmill, and whenever I get hungry, I dress up like the monster and I go eat all the villagers' crops.
Don't say that.  You're makin' me feel bad.
Thanks, Finn.
Really?
No. No, wait!
I'm not a monster! I was just pretending to be a monster.
I'm sorry that you're starving because I ate all of your crops, even though you're all still really fat, and I probably helped you lose some weight.
Don't get all bent out of shape! I'm just being honest!
What?
Please don't kill me!
Why don't you just get your parents to buy you more crops?
You guys are parents? Just like my parents...
Yeah, Finn, I'm great. Here,  I want you to have these sandwiches.
Yeah, they're really good. They're made with a lot of love.
I saved the village!
And that's how I saved the village!
Whatever.It's me, Ice King.
Yeah.
No, Ice King, listen. I'm gonna give you the straight dope.
You're weird and old and you kidnap princesses.
But I asked you here tonight because I wanna know what you think of this.
I want you to read it because you're their dad. Please be their dad right now and bring them to life!
No!  That's not how I sound! Read it in a better voice!
I don't want to be a monster.
No!
I won't eat them!
No!
No, no, no! I told you hundreds of times that I don't want to be a monster, and there's nothing you can do about it!
Hey! You're not supposed to read it like that. Say it in a nicer way!Oh, my Glob, Melissa! I think it's kicking in!G-G-Get away from my camp! I'll cut you! Hrm. I'm never gonna go back home.
Oh, my Glob! What the stuff are you doing?! Why are you cutting my lumps?!
I knew you liked me.
Just admit it, Lover Boy! You can't resist me! Well, if you want these lumps, you gotta put a ring on it! Where's my ring?!  I knew you liked me, Finn. That's why you're running! Get in touch with your feelings, babe!Whoopiiieee...
What?! No way! It's super easy!
Fine. I'll prove it.  Huh? Ah! Oh, no!  Oh, snap!
Oh. Sorry I bit your leg.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, right. Sorry.
Nah, that's no bump. It's the early stage of the lumps.
It just means he's changing into a Lumpy Space guy, on account of my bite. It's just like, um, y'know... werewolf rules?  Ar, rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr!
Yeah. There's an antidote, but you have to go all the way to Lumpy Space to get it. And Jake has to use it by sunset.
He'll be lumpy, like, forever.
Yeah, I mean, there's a portal nearby. I can show you whenever.
Don't go telling everyone about this portal or whatever. It's kind of a secret.
Portal's that Frog and mushroom.
Whatevers2009!!
Yeah, whatever, fine.
Hold it. First, you should check out my house. It's, like, kind of lame, but way less lame than, like, your house.
It's up there at Makeout Point.
Yeah. You have to travel by car in my world, or else you'll fall into the Lumpy Abyss.
I had to, Dad... I'm trying to help them, so don't lumping yell at me!
I SAID, LUMP OFF, MOM!!!
WHAT?!?!
Oh, yeah.  I need to borrow the car.
Shucks! I lumping hate them! I'm really, really sorry, Finn. But I can't help you because my parents are horrible idiots.
My friend Melissa has a car. But she's dating my ex-boyfriend Brad.
Hmm.   Call BFF 66.
Hey, Melissa. What's up?
I'm asking her, jeez! Melissa, just listen!
Melissa. I'm trying to help out some friends.
Oh, Glob. I forgot.
Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance!  It's gonna be so flipping awesome!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  Wha?!
Hmm.
Yeah, whatever. Just don't mess with my phone again.
We've been here for, like, five minutes.
Hey. This is hard for me, too. I mean, I used to eat chili cheese fries with Brad... so there's gonna be a lot of romantic tension on this ride!
Scooch over, Finn. I'm gonna sit in the back.
This is it.
Wait. Watch yourself, Finn. The guys who use the antidote up here are notorious for being...  smooth posers.
It just means what it means. Hurry. Get the antidote so we can get outta here.
BUUUUMPS.
What's taking so long? Did those smooth-heads give you the orb already, or what?
What do you care? Just give 'em the antidote already, and stop being such a poser.
What? I was helping you.
You're welcome a lot.
Wow. Now I know how you really feel. I was just trying to help, but whatever.  No. No, not whatever! I know I mess things up sometimes, but I'm really trying! And you guys are supposed to be my friends!  Not like the fake ones I have here! So do what you want! I'm going to Promcoming! Are you coming or not, Lumpy Jake?
You know, it's fine. You and Jake can make it up to me by dancing this last dance with me.Ehh.
Get on with it!
