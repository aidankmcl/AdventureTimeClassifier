Ahh!
Get out of my house or I'm going to face blaaaast you.
Yep, yeah. I know you. You're one of those swimmers right? A reeeal swim nut.
Well you can't swim in me. Not anymore, I'm not water. You can't get me up your nooooose.
I'm going to keep going, into here.
Hey kid.  It's me again. Carroll, my name's Carroll.
Finn, look I'm sorry about blasting you yesterday. Hey man, are you really gonna do those things?
I get it, I get it. But let me tell you something. I used to be water. Like a pond or something real wet. I used to hate people swimming in me,  kicking and stuff. So what did I do? I evaporated, I got myself out of there.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, you have to stop obsessing about revenge.  Umph.  Be like me and run away, you have to run away and never stop hating your old life.  You gotta really dwell on it. Ah!
I just thought about my anxieties and it's like my mind hand touched a hot memory stove.
Ah!
I don't know what you're talking about. Alright then, I guess I'll see you later.
Finn! Hey what's it like up there?  I figured I could turn into spaces, or something.
