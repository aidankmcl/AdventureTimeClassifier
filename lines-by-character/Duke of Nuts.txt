Lisby! Who's at the door?
Why would you want to sack my nut castle on my second son's first birthday?! SEIZE HIM!
Oh! How wonderful!
You're late, Marceline! My son has been dying to hear your undead music!Oh...
No! Please! This has gone far enough!
Who's the toughest little nut? That's you.   One second.
Oh! Sorry to make you wait. I made these daisy crowns for you guys as a- as a token of gratitude for waiting.  Oh...sorry I....I have to sit down for a second. I know this is an odd question, but you wouldn't happen to have any pudding on you, would you?
Oh, thank goodness.
Oh, I'm so embarrassed! Now you know my shame. I can't stop eating pudding.
I don't tell people because I hate making them worry, but yes, I have a rare condition. A pudding deficiency. And I always end up eating all of the royal pudding supply whenever I go to the castle.
Yes, but I didn't turn Princess Bubblegum green and bald! I would never do such a thing!
Hey, it's okay. People make mistakes. It's all part of growing up and you never truly stop growing.
Maybe I should just confess the crime and end all of this.
I don't know if I can do this.
And that's how I, the Duke of Nuts, by disfiguring you beyond all recognition, humbly saved your life.
She's right. Innocent or not, I should accept what's coming to me.
Nuttin's going my way today.
It's true, your majesty. I'm sorry for my medical condition.
