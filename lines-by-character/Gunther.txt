Stop, demon! Get back here, I say! Ha ha, nowhere to run. I, the great and powerful Urgence Evergreen, command you to freeze into a million pieces and leave young Gunther alone!
Foolish demon, you leave me no choice. Zap, zap zap zap zap! What?
No, Nina! You're supposed to be frozen. Nina!
Nina, the portals! The Elementals are gathering! C'mon, you blockhead!
Sorry, Master Evergreen.
Ouch! Oof! OUCH! Uh, Master Evergreen? Can I ride on the palanquin with you? My feet are soft.  No, you're right. Ooh, boy...
Gettin' fat.  Gettin' fat, right?
However, I would suggest this is still a nice night. It's quiet.
Okay.
Sorry, Master, I'll put him back.
Uh, Master? I'm sorry, I don't think I've seen any water at all today.
Wait, are you my father?
Hmm.
Heh, you don't know where you're going, do you, girl?  Ah, you're good at this.  Man, you know who I like? Master Evergreen. He can do anything; one thing he's gonna dohe said he's gonna teach me magic. I can be like him!
