No food here.
FIX THE DOOR!
There is no more candy to hoard. Let them keep what crumbs they find, for there are no crumbs.
...for whom they starve.
...when she saw fit to create me, Lemongrab...
Yes, yes! All her fault!
I said, all her fault.
I looked deep in myself and found that I'm a guy who can't stop making candy life from the food he needs.
It just felt so pretty okay inside, greeting each new placid face...
We used the last of the food to make Plop-Top, here.
Who cares anyway? They've brought no food! We're all going to die!
Yes, yes. There we go!
Ooh!
For our boys.
Mmmm, here's the plan...
Now go, young Lemonjon!
All your fault!
We warned you about us!Eat on it!
Hm.
Oh, little Lemon-Sweets, our son.  So precious. You enjoy sitting in your chair?  What would you like to do now?  Go to bed.
Dearest brother, I really think Lemon-Sweets would rather go to bed.
I'll fetch our son a sleeping bonnet.  Beautiful.    Brother, stop that!!
The end! My end!Me too!
Ow!
Save us, Lemonhope! You're our only lemon-ho!
Hey. Hey, guy. Back here.
Hey, c'mon, I've fallen off back there. Guy? Hey, buddy.
Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy...Play it, Lemonhope!
The harp! Hurry! I'll take care of the rest!
The harp, Lemonhope! Play it!
The harp, Lemonhope! The harp!
Faster, Lemonhope!
Faster, Lemonhope!
Faster!Yes, welcome
Hmm. Acceptable.
Acceptable.
Come, one and all, and join the dance!
Lemon brothers! Stop! Stop and listen!  It has cost me much, but I have learned that lemon need not squeeze lemon to survive. Lemonhope, go forth, grow strong, and return for us!
