You should eat an apple to reinvigorate your climbing ability.
Huh? Huh?
Aw, that apple was cursed or something. I'm sorry, I didn't know. Oh, dear I ruined your day and now you'll never get your disc.
Oh, good! What a relief!  Best of luck to you!
Wrap it up good so I don't trip and fall on my face like the last time.
Well, I made sure he ate that apple like you guys told me to do, but get this!  It made him smaller! I think it mighta been cursed you guys!
Sorry.

I'm not allowed to talk to you.   Anyone and anything that winds up in the tree becomes part of the tree forever and ever. In the tree, part of the tree.
Well yes. And no. Are you a prisoner? Yes. Will you ever be free? No. In the tree, part of the tree. It's very simple.
No I- Well yes and no. Am I allowed to leave the tree? No. Have I already left the tree? Am I miles away from the tree right now flying around like the flying squirrel that I am? Yes! In my mind! In- my- mind!
Yeah!  Well, yes and no. Do I like the nuts and acorns? Yes. Do I like it when they put me down and say mean things like You're not a flying squirrel, you're just a regular squirrel! Nyaah!? No. Do I wanna fly away from this place now? Yes. Would I make a break for it if I had a buddy to break out with? Yes.
