Do what thoust will be the whole piece of Law.
Im not coming back.Bzzz, bzzz, bzzz, bzzz. The waffle doll shall fall lest you eat the yellow dough.  Bzzzzz...Magic.... Away!
You gave me that candy now I'll do you a favor in return. A magic favor.   A mystical, magical favor!
...For you!
Because on this day, a magical life lesson comes to you.
Not until you appreciate what a jerk I am. Wazoo!
Food. Food for a beggar
Y'all got any food?
That's right. It is I, the magic Man!  Zap
Come on, apple grease! What are you gonna do?
Ohh!
Are you sure about that?
Why should I? You still act like a hero only so you can get what you want.
Wrong!
Yes, my children, you are so close to the answer.
Oh, yes, that's it!  You've finally learned your lesson.  And now I'm off spread my teachings to more sissy do-gooders.  You're welcome!Hey, friend. Don't be afraid. I'm a gypsy child like you, running wild and crazy!   Hold on, wow... a falling star. Hm, it's too far though.  MAGIC! You're welcome.  Hm... oh... there... wait!  Oh, Glob.
My juice!  Not... flowing... right...! Dream on, honey! You can't catch this!  Magic, away!  Whoops!
Aah!  Ooh! Waaa-zoo!
Shhh.
Did it work? Is he gone?
Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't. See?  The transfer drained me. I can probably barely float.  So, I just gotta wait till they kill your friend! See ya!
They're gonna put him on trial for my crimes! Ain't nobody gonna pardon these crimes on my head. Not even the King of Mars! And once he's dead, my magic juice will return to my body. Flowing through me like moonlight through the ghost dance.
I wish I could help. Except I don't!
C'mon, let's go to my house. C'MON, LET'S GO TO MY HOUSE!!
Yes, that is true!
There is, but you'll never make it work.
I don't know! Have you seen my trash palace?
That's where I blow my nose all day!
Yes, welcome to my tower of light! Everyone is welcome to share this magic kingdom. Squirrels, black mold, worms, poison ivy... tiny manticore!
You tell me.
Memories drift in and out of my mind...
It's downstairs.
My special thing.  Whoa! Aaaaagh!
Aah!  Tada! C'mon.  That's the thing. My special thing.  A Martian transporter.
Yeah. My brothers gave it to me when they banished me to earth. They thought I'd learn love and use it to go back home.
You put your hands on those thingies and think stuff about people.  But it's broken! Hasn't worked in 200 years.
Huzzah??
I win again, just like always!
Oh, Margles.Magic dog! I'll take some sandwich!
Hmm... yeah, I could do that... or... wait, wait!
That's a good-looking sandwich.
It's got my germs, so it's mine now.
Dead arms!
Look, if you really want your sandwich, you'll have to solve my little riddle.  When your face shows 7:20, when green leaves turn brown, the only way forward is down. Then you'll see, the wetter, the better.
You try and come up with something on the spot! It's hard!
Now to savor the moment.   It's just you and me, baby.
