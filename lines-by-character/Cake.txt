Good job, girl! Have some spaghetti!
That's not a book! It's a bomb!
Aww, what a sweetie!
Hop on, baby!
Ooh, nice throw!
What about Gumball's mission we went on this morning? Delivering daisy chains to the fluffy people not enough for you?
I'm not going out there! It's wet.
Fionna!
Oh, oh!  I got a hot potata! And I gots two hot tomatas! Well they'll make a good sauce maybe...
... on the table... the table... for as long as I am able!
Hey, break it up, you too!!
Yeah...
Uh-uh boy, what are you thinking?
Fionna!
Grab onto my little paws!
Oh, goodness!What are these boogers for, anyway?
Fionna, we got trouble! My tail is totally frizzin' out!
We'd love to!
Yes, we'll be there!
Oh, it's a date!
Shut up, he's into you!
Well, that could change tonight.
I'm coming to help you! Hold on, I'm bringing my dulcimer.
It's a conversation starter.
No! No retreat, girl.
Hiya, gorgeous.
Catnip! Sweet babies!
Psst, Fi, tell Gumball that you think he's hot.
Guys like to hear that they're hot!
After him, Fionna. After your man.
Why are y'all breathless if we're the ones running?
See you back at the tree house.
I know! I was there for that part!
Oh, my goodness! It's almost seven! You need something to wear! Oh, hold on honey, I am gonna make this happen!
It's a ball! You don't need weapons!
Okay! Lets go, go, go!
Okay, girl! I'll see you later!
Fionna!
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HE  AAAHH! Don't you touch her!
Ha ha! I'm a queen!
Me, too. Ice King's the real deal!Ya!
Ha! Dance you puppets!
How'd he know your name?
Y'all seeing those big floaty faces?
Yeah, whatever.
Haha! Cake's helping!
