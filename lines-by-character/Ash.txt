Hey, stop looking at yourself. You're ugly, bro. Get lost. This is my busking spot.Yeah, me too. Oh, hey, wait. Watch this--I've been practicing.
Hey, open your eyes, look at this, Mar-Mar. Check it out. It's my new wand.  These cherry blossoms, look, look as close as you can, and they're real.
Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much. To a Witch.
That's why it's so valuable, genius--for potions.
But--but not all of it!
That's right, genius.
The important thing is... Marceline's awake.
That's right, babe.
Just picking up my girl for a night on the town; at my place.
That's a relief.
Don't you guys get it? I outbrained you. That wasn't the memory of a sleep spell you brought me. That memory was our break-up!
That's enough of that?
Yup. Come on, Mar-Mar, let's go.
Ashicus Flyicus.
What's all this hullabaloo?!
Hey, hold it, you, get back here!
Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much. To a witch.
Yo, Mar-Mar. WhatWhat's with the chump? C'mon, I said no chumps.  Ash gets hungies at eight o' clock. You need to get back in the kitchen and make me din-ner.
I want a turkey sandwich with to-ma-to.
Also pickles.
Ohh...I can't see...Somebody call my mom!
