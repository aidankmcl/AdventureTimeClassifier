Eh? Is that Jake?
C'mon, man! It's Goose! Your best friend, Goose!
Aww, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, ya big goof! How long's it been? Two, three years?
I've never been here. You've still got it, Jake.
C'mon! Let's get you home. Everyone's waiting for you at the party.
No. Par-tay!
Hey, Jake.
Now that you're back, how 'bout that five bucks you still owe me?
Cheeseburger cheesecake ring a bell?
Oh, oh, that. Don't worry about that. Do notdon't worry about that.
I think there's a leftover nacho basket or something in the fridge.
Just a sec.  Cold cut-and-nacho sandwiches!
Go.
Then you won't have to pay me back that five bucks.
Go eat, Jake!
