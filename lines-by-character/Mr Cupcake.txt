Surely this frosted drink will soothe my fevered tempers.  Hellooo? Good heavens! A lycanthrope! AAAAH!!Dare.
Jake, truth or dare?
Do you prefer chocolate or fudge?There's a seat by me.
We nominate you, Crunchy, to go listen at the door.
Step aside, Crunchy. I'll make short work of this door opening.  Oh. I guess I'm just too strong.
No air? I'll smash down the door!
Huh?
In here, you say?
Manfried's a good leader because we can always see him.
No! Manfried is still the most clearly visible.It's okay, Lady. You gotta let go. He's gone now. Let me take you out for a coffee... get your mind off things.
Hey, Lady, I'm here for you. Don't you ever forget that.
I, I love you, Jake. We should have hung out more.
What? I would never. I've got so much respect for you.
That means so much to me.  I wish we had more time together.Yes.
I don't hear her complaining.UUGH!  I can't, Princess! My arm is broken!
