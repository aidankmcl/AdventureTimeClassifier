Hey!   Razzamafoo!
You ate one of my donuts!
RAAAAAGH!! You're lying! The stink of magic dog lips is everywhere!
I never married!
You... you're eating one right now!
MAGICUS NOMORICUS!

I stripped him of his magical powers!
I AM NOT MARRIED!
The only way I'll give back your powers is if you admit your error and say you're sorry and mean it! ...'Cause I can tell the difference.
RRRRAAAARRGH!!  Go-backicus-from-whence-you-came-icus!
Are you alright, my... my donut pretties? Heh heh... Wait a second. YOU'RE A BAGEL! LIARS! LIARS EVERYWHERE!
The only way I'll give back your powers is if
Oh, you're doing so well... and I hate you so much!!
Razzamafoo.
Mmm... Apology denied.
Because you took too long. Now you have to apologize while doing a variety of humiliating things.
Who is that?!
Then he has to do it too.
Wait, wait. Start over.
It's for my newsletter.
Then guess what, cool guy? You can forget about getting your powers back... EVER!!
Hm. He says he's dying. Let that be a lesson to all you cupcakes.  Hah...
So I've finally broken you.
YES! GLOAT, GLOAT, GLOAT! Alright, I think you've learned your lesson.  I forgive you.
WHAAA! OOF!   But didn't you learn your lesson?!?
