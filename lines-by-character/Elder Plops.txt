Order, order! I demand order. I, Elder Plops, being the coolest guy in the room, will settle this dispute. The matter will be settled on the battleground...
...the battleground of love.
The couple that I deem most truly in love shall rule the Slime Kingdom for life.  Plops out.
Welcome to the Trials of Glarb, hosted by me, Elder Plops. The first trial will be Crooning. You guys are gonna get into these sweet boats I made and croon for each other on the lake. The most loving and heartfelt song, judged by me, Elder Plops, will win.
I really want to hear some emotional song work here. The people want to hear emotional stuff. So let's see some stuff, alright?
Finn, way to go. I could tell the people were really impressed. Guillermo, you're up.
Elder Plops thinks that's okay.
As Elder Plops, I have heard many songs in my life, and I can only say this... Finn, you win this one.
Welcome, everyone, to our second trial...  Spooning. When I say go, the big spoon will put his arm around the little spoon and cuddle. I will be watching you spoon, measuring and assessing your love by posture and overall vibe. The best cuddle, or spoon, wins.
Spooners, get in your futons.
Ready, set...
Spoon!
Blargetha and Guillermo, very nice.
Yeesh. Alright, everyone, stop. I've seen enough. Blargetha and Guillermo's love was way-off-the-charts good. They win.
The score is tied. There's one more trial after Spooning and Crooning: Smooching. I'm sorry it doesn't rhyme with Crooning and Spooning. We will begin our next trial on the morrow!
By the authority of Elder Plops,  I officially declare...  you are still the Slime princess.
