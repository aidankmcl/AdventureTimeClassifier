I am the mayor of this village. Our gold has just been stolen by the very monster you speak of.
Our people thank you. I present to you this photo  of the Gut Grinder to help in your mission.
Wha--? Oh, it's the Gut Grinder!
His face is weird. The truth is obvious: your friend is the Gut Grinder!
You are under arrest for stealing our gold.
What the--?  What the--? Sharon, what are you doing in the Gut Grinder?
And the Gut Grinder's skin is not skin at all--it's cloth! Sharon! Have you been sewing?!
WHY, SHARON?!
You have been a naughty girl, Sharon.  Guards! Throw my wife in jail.  Finn and Jake, thank you for saving my Spiky Village.
Now give us a hug.
