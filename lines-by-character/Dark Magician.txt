Congratulations, Finn the human. You must be truly righteous to have made it this far.
Now! Enter my brain-world, and I will show you some aspect of yourself that you're not entirely aware of.
For your final trial, slay the beast!
Yeeeeessss. It's completely evil. Will you slay it?
Yeeeeessss! You've done well, hero.
Now! As one last, last trial... Slay this ant!
No! But it's not good either. It's, uh, neutral. Will you slay it?
If you want the heroes' Enchiridion, then slay this unaligned ant!
Uh oh.
