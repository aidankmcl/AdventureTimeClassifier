Hello, Finn. Are you here to arrest the Duke?
The nuts told me...for I am the Duchess of Nuts!
I know of my husband's crime against the princess. A crime that you personally witnessed! And why would you lie? Huh?
Oh but he was once such a wonderful man! He'd pet dogs, kissed babies; we'd lie together underneath the cashew bush. He even taught under-privileged nuts how to dance. But somehow he's gone rancid! These nuts tell me he must be executed. Would you like to hear what my nuts have to say?!
Listen! Listen!
