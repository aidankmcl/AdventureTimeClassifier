,     !      !      ! Oh, I was worried about my parents! My mom and dad are crazy about dogs! A dog saved my dad in the war!Finn! Oh, of all days! Where are you going? Jake, where are you?

No matter what, he's into his characters.
Jake, what are you doing? Please tell me.Hold down the tape until it fully sticks to the paper.

. ,     .     ?!         . I told him that his Vietnamese noodles were too tough before he went missing. Why did I say such a thing?! What if something bad happens to him?! The last conversation we had was that his noodles were tough!
.      . Sorry. I guess I've eaten too many noodles.

.. .     .        .  , ,    .      !     ..         !       !      ,        .        . You're right. I worry too much sometimes. I always get haunted by this nightmare where zombies attack my house! My uncle, aunt-in-law, and cousins are all present in my house. I even hear the crying coming from the upstairs. If I could just protect my dear family.  I become too stressful during that dream. I even grind my own teeth!  When I wake up in the morning, all my teeth are cracked up! I usually try to forget about it, thinking that it's just a dream or I'm being paranoid, but I was actually attacked by zombies before, twice!
,   . Ugh, it's hard to see.
