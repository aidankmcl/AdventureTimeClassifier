Leave her be, Boilbee.
A princess deserves empathy, not your sass.
Some of us still want to feel, you know? The vital...  ...magnetism of life.  The vibrating energies that connect all living and... nonliving beings.
I don't think so, m'lady, but I am honored.
Sorry, I don't know anything. I can't imagine anyone who would harm someone as beautiful as this.
Did you try looking yonder?  That's where the ne'er-do-well ghosts hang out.
Of course not.  Two, please.  And we might never find out, but that's okay because right now, in this moment, I'm feeling pretty sweetles, you know?
That's great, Ghost Princess. I'm glad we can feel this way together, in the face of uncertainty.
More beautiful than I could imagine.
I'm talking... about you, Princess.
Hold up! These guys are with me.
I feel it, too. Our spirits must be intwined in the cosmic wheel of time.
Let's go to my private mausoleum where we can be... private.
Warrior Princess! Give up your kingdom!
My love...  NOOOOOO!!!
I... did it?
I can't! My soul is stuck! I have to know how I died! Oh, Glob... My life is like a fart.
MY LIFE IS LIKE A FART!!!
Huh? Uh... Squeez-E-Mart? I'm starting to remember!   I was a broken man.
More.
I don't care. My life is like a fart.
My life is like a fart!
Ghost Princess!!!
Thanks for everything! Goodbye!
