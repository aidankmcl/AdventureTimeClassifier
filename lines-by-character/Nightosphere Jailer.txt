The Nightosphere.
You're in the Nightosphere.
Uh, yes. You got thrown in jail. Look.
Up an' at em, people.  Eveyone out of your cages. My shift is over, and no one's shown up, so...
I mean... yeah, but not really. You're in the nightosphere, so...
You can't leave the Nightosphere. Not unless he let's you.
Yeah, that's Hunson Abadeer. He runs this place.
You can't just talk to the boss. You gotta make an appointment.
Ugh. Oh! Oh, oh, sick! You touched that stuff?!
Later, fools.
