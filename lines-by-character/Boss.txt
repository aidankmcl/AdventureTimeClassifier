My jacket-sta!Root Beer Guy. Root Beer Guy. Root Beer Guy, how many bottles of products you've sold this month?
Great, you can count to zero.
Hmph, you haven't earned the new leads.Hey, girl.
Sniffin' around for that chedda?
I might could, but it's a top-shelf shakedown. Know what I'm saying?
There's a rival camp down river. The leader's got some magic omelette, you know?  Mmm. You know? The kind you wear around your neck.
Oh, don't get fresh with me, girlie. I talk good. Anyway, when I get my hands on that omelet, whoo-hoo! Forget about everything, baby. I'll be the biggest cheese in creation.
Shake on it.
You pull this off, and I'll let you join my gang.
And, on the other hand, so to speak, if you screw up or chicken out, you're out of the game. Permanently.  Pretend my finger's a knife.
