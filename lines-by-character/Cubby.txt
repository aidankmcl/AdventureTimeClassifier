I'm Cubby.
I heard what you said... about this being a monster's belly? I've been telling everyone that for three days!
'Cause I'm just a kid!
No! I wasn't! I swear! I'm dancing, see? SEE?!
You could talk to Party Pat.
He's our chief. If you can convince him to leave, all will follow.
Sure. He sleeps on the monster's heart. It's like a blood waterbed.
This is as far as I go. Party Pat is right around this corner. Bye, you guys!
