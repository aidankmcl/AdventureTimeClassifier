Now Finn, come on, there's no bad blood here!  Come here, let's bury the hatchet!  See how I'm not killing you?
Alright, I don't want to embarrass my little girl.  So young lady, have you thought about my offer?
I want Marceline to take over the Nightosphere! Finally join the family business!
Oh!  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on...  Check it out, sweetie.  See how chaotic it is out there?  How everyone's confused and frustrated? The Nightosphere is sustained by chaos!
Okay. But I know you'll come around eventually. Or maybe you won't! I don't know. You're an independent woman!  Well, I'm gonna take a nappy.  Oh! I almost forgot!
Whoops! Hahaha!  You should put this amulet on. It'll grant you wishes for, like, ponies. Or whatever kids like.
Ha! Yes you are, sweetie.  Daddy's little monster!
Just grabbing a midnight snack.
I know!  Isn't it fantastic?
Save her?
But this is what I've always wanted! My girl, following in her daddy's footsteps.
That's balderdash, baby. The wearer of the amulet is filled with chaotic evil! Which is how I grew up. So...
Marceline! Um, I wonder what happened to him! Kids these days... am I right?
I know, I'm sorry. But I thought you'd want to, want to make your old man proud and you know... take over the Nightosphere.
No, I didn't mean... Baby, of course I'm proud of you.
And your friends? They're alright! That political rap?  Pretty great!
