Help! Help!  A monster!  Oh! Thank goodness! Heroes! I'm being chased by a horrible Dragon! Please, please help!
Act quickly! He's almost upon us!
No, but please!
Well... I've been running all day. I guess I'm pretty hungry.
Where're you going?!
AAAH!! NO!! HELP!!
No thanks to you two!! That dragon chased me for two days!! ...And then I was lost for... uh, three days... and then I... I fell under a spell of a beautiful enchantress for...  a week? So that's two, plus three, plus a week
Oh, thank you!  Hahahaha! Hahaha.  AAAH! WHAT'S HAPPENING?!
Wha? Ah... uh?!
Why?! Why would anyone want that?!
You're supposed to beat up monsters so we don't have to defend ourselves!
Helping?! I can't even move my hands! I'm a cobbler! How'm I supposed to cobble with these useless chunk mitts?!
WHAT?! NO
No, you're not!! You're just watching my shop while I go to the dermatologist!  And don't try to cobble anything!
Hey, everyone! I'm back from the doctor!  WHY?!
GET OUT!!
Oh, my laces! You're the most beautiful
