BMO? Did I hear BMO?
Hey, I'm Moe!  Don't worry! My legs don't work!
My skin is human!
Hey, come on, now!  It is BMO! Looks like there's some software problems!  Hmm.
Huh? What? No...BMO's one of a kind. I built BMO to take care of my son.  Oh, thank you. But I guess I never ended up dating any women. So, that's sad.  I sent BMO off into the world alone.  Hoping to find a family home. And then maybe even find somebody else's little boy to take care of.
Oh, there's that back-up driver disk!  Thank you.   That oughta done it. I must've built what, like, a million MOs. But BMO is very, very special. I built BMO to understand fun. And how to play.  You see, I made BMO to be more.
Nah, I'm just your poop.
Ah, those were just the surface jerks.  Up, please.  Kid, come over here.  BMO, say hello to your family.
