Marceline!
Is this kid your evil servant?
Super good?
Stealing your soul.
Haha! Oh, Marceline! I never know what's gonna set you off! Whoa! Is this the family ax?
Did you turn it into some kind of lute?
Okay, I'll go. I've got business to attend to, anywaysucking up all the souls in Oooooo...
See you kids later!
Um... Well, I'm sure not the guy who's gonna suck out your soul.
Really!? Well... I know a little exercise for that! Wanna try??
First... close your eyes.
Ah, but I didn't! And now, aren't you thrilled just to be alive?
So... This next part will be all the more... horrifying.
Alright.
I've got a joke, too.  What wears a dark suit, is completely evil, and is about to suck out all your souls?
That's right! I'm your mama!
So, finally taking a run at your old man, huh?
Karate kick!!
Karate chop!!  You can't destroy me!
You're not even alive!
Of all history's greatest monsters, you are by far the most evil thing I've encountered. Offer your soul to me, dark one.
NO! You can't have my soul! I don't even...! Look, just get in here.
Keep your crummy soul!
YES!!
Huh?  Oh, Marceline. Still following me?
No, Marceline.
Give back that ax, Marceline! You don't respect it enough!
Fine!! Go!! I'm too busy sucking to deal with you!
Marceline, do you really feel this way?
Marceline... of course I love you.
I'm sorry I ate your fries. I didn't mean to hurt you.
No, it's not okay. They weren't even very good. They were really cold. I love you, Marceline. Don't you ever doubt that.
Oh, Marceline, I am so
