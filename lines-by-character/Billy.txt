Ha-ha! Check out these dummies.

Billy!
You finished my list. Now I can rest like a great hero. Thank you, Finn.
Tell Canyon I watch her sleep. Man, love is weird, Finn.
No. Goodbye.
What?
Oh, uh, you must go to the Citadel. That's where your father is.
Not Joshua! Your other dad. Dad the Human.
Your father, Finn. He's alive.Hello.
Yep. It's me.
What for?
Ahh, that'd be a waste of time.
No, I was talking about beating up monsters. It's as pointless as a dog chasing his own tail.
You know where she is right now? She's probably being eaten by a different monster. She's probably dead.  In my youth, I was much like you. Motivated. Headstrong. Wore a silly, little outfit. Even had a magic dog.
All my life, I've beaten on evil creatures.  But new evil keeps popping up. Kicking their butts was a hopeless effort!
Nonviolently. Help people by being active in your community.
Aw, I don'tI don't wanna buy anything.
Don't you see how pointless it is? You know what's probably happening to that old lady right now? She's probably dead!
Hmm. Perhaps you're right.  It's... it's as if your words are filling a void in my very being... You wanna watch?  Nothung!  Finn and Jake... truly, you are my heroes.  Now you're freakin' me out...
Huh... Hello.
Get outta here!!Huh!? WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU GUYS DOIN IN MY CRACK?! It's THREE O' CLOCK IN THE MORNING!
What? Why would I be dead?!
Was the Cosmic Owl there?
Your dream is an ill omen of GRAVE significance.
Finn?
Are you ready to come with me on a mission to save all life from the Lich?
That's right.
No time. The fate of the world hangs in the balance.
GET OUT OF THERE!
I found it in the mouth of a bear.
This book is REALLY important It has magical powers. Turn the little sword sideways.
Exhibio Carnotum!
Hold on!
I'm going to push the Lich in there
HURRY!!!
