Oh, Glob! Oh, oh, oh!Someone should listen at the door.
Eh, what? Why me?
No, I'm not.
I hear, like, uh, like, a lush, green field... next to a white picket fence. Finn and the princess both brought picnic baskets. Oh, but they brought the same stuff, and they're laughing about it. And now they're kissing.
Well, you guys asked me to paint a picture.
I can't hear anything. They must be just lightly brushing their lips together.
So they're dead, right?
Sire, I must congratulate you on becoming princess.
Is there anything I can do or get for you?
Anything.
Yes.
To the crater!
Any last words, Starchie?
Throw him in!Whoa!
Aaagh... Glob? Is that you?
