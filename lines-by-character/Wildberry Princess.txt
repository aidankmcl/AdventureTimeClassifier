Maybe this story is a new form of torture!
Romance is a great idea!
Yeah! It's good!Finn and Jake?
What...?
Get out of here!
Jake, I am warning you.
Aah! Guards! Guards! Seize Finn and Jake and prepare them for execution!
And take all their money!
Finn and Jake, yes, you have insulted me, but worse than that, you have abused the power of money!
We will deal with you swiftly and ironically by encasing you in your own molten gold!
Release the golden flood!
Who dares?
Finn and Jake, if you ever return to Wildberry Kingdom again, I'll have you double-dipped in gold! Unless I get a written apology.Please! Let me go home!
What?  I... I don't... uh... um...
I... I don't know what you're talking about.
You're really frightening me.Yeah, well, you know.
Oh, you're welcome, Finn, and thank you for answering my urgent summons.
Oh, it's nothing really. Someone's trying to kill me.
It's no big deal. Finish your pie.
Okay.
I suspect that I've been targeted by the Guild of Assassins.
I found this note stabbed to my door... man.
You done in there, Jake?
W-w-why would you say that?
Uh... That's very good?
No! Stop! Please!
Oh, my, look at how close to the edge I am!
Aww! How 'bout I made you my royal pet?
Oh, dear....
Oh, no, this is a medical condition. I need a hospitalMy arm!Finn! Are you okay?
I don't know how.
I don't think I can.
Oh dear!Shh!
