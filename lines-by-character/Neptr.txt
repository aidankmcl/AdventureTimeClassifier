Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey, BMO. Wake up, buddy. Are you alright?
Whoa, sorry, man. You want some pie or something?
Nah, no one's been down here all day except me, you, and Ronnie.
I don't know, but now my sensors indicate that some treasure is missing ...about a sock's worth.
Bebe's dead?
Hey, BMO. We should hang out more. We're both robots.But BMO, I don't want to be the bad guy. I want to be Robbing Hood's pal, Friar Tux.
No fair. En guard!
Aaaaa!
Neptr knows just the place to blow your grease. Behold, this recent advertisement.
Me too!Jake, you've found Neptr! I am the ultimate hide-and-seek champion! 15 months, 4 days, 9 hours and you guys did not find me!  Hahahaha-hahaha.
I missed you, creator.
To count to 100 while you hide? 1, 2,.. 3, 4, 5--
You cannot tell but I am giving a thumbs up.
I am finished!
Haha, we are as one, creator.
I will solve this, creator. I will extinguish her using our suit! Foam blaster.  Hold still, burning lady.
Locked on target.
Yes, creator.
Oh, my...
Not true, creator. You haven't failed Neptr. Even if everyone burns, you'll still have me, creator.
Goodbye, lady.Stranger, hark! The traps galore may kill you whilst you do explore. To free yourself -
Check out my mods, bro.
Slop your mouths up. I have found an oven and baking supplies.
What, Papi?
I make pies, too, Papi.
No. Real pies. Don't you remember? I am your s-
Can't you fly us across, Papi?
Yes, Papi!
Look!
Papi, no!  Ouchies!
The door is secured with an esoteric encryption system.
I'm not BMO, I'm your son Neptr. I-I throw pies.
Father! Look at me.
Are you happy with me now, Papi?
Your journal?
Don't be sad, Papi. Your characters can always be real in the garden of your mind.
Remember when you showed me your imagination zone?
Our worlds will surely meet, Ice King.BMO, when is something going to happen?
Oooooh.
But where does it go?
Ha ha! Neat!Ouch!
Greeting, creator!
My name is Neptr, which stands for Never-Ending Pie-Throwing Robot.
Creator, I am eager to commence the creation and propulsion of pies forever, but my pie-hucking appendage is... malfunctioning, and my oven lamp is cold, and my tank treads do not roll! They only do skids! Why, creator?!  Does it please you to watch me struggle?!
Haha! I'll always love you, creator!
Ooh, what beautiful piles of sugar!
Snoooow??
But, creator, is not breaking and entering wrong?
Sneaking! We're sneaking...
Sneaking...
Sneaking...
Sneaking!
Creator, if we get caught, I want you to know that I will always love you.
What'll we do, creator?
Creator, you have shown me the joys of pranking! I cannot wait to throw pies infinitely at Jake's face!
Creator! Lightning!
That was a great plan!
Are those my tickets to the gun show, creator?
Neptr is fully functional! Yay!
Creator?
Oh, right!
Just boysenberry. Hahaha. And also... poison.
I am troubled, creator. Troubled by a sudden urge to... collect princesses.
Uh-huh. Sure.
Oooh!
Oooh...
I am torn! I am processing a love for both princesses and pranking!
Tell me more, Papi!
Can I still prank with Finn after?
Haha! Yeah, I love Finn's pranks!
I... uh, I... choose... Ice King!
I'm not finished. I choose Ice King... to prank! Hardcore!
Sleep well, Papi. In your Imagination Zone full of beautiful princesses.
It's why I was created.
