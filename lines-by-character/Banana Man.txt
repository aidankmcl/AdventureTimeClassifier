Ahh!!
Ahh!
I just wanted to borrow some sugar!!
Aoo hoo! Ha ha!  Uh huh!  Ha ha!  Yeah!Hey! Hey, guys! Hi!
Wow! I haven't seen you fellas since you destroyed my home, my land, and my rocket.
Don't worry about it! Feh! Bygones! I'm just excited you called me over. We're neighbors. We should help each other out. I got the soda and the jams.
I see the problem. The top of your engine is gone, specifically, the cylinder head.
Let me explain.  The cylinder head is the top to the cylinder block.  Think of the cylinder head as an airtight lid to your engine that regulates air, fuel, and exhaust.
Now this lid is important because it works to get fuel into your engine.  You see, your engine has cylinders, and these cylinders are pistons. When the piston in the cylinder moves down, it creates a vacuum, pulling in fuel from the intake.
That's right, BMO.  Have a gold star, dear.
Then the piston returns to the top, compressing the air-fuel mixture. Then a spark plug fires off, creating an explosion, driving the piston back down, powering the engine.
Hmm. Well, sometimes people store parts they're working on in the car.  Ah! Bingo!  Found it.
Well... n-not quite. We don't know why they took the cylinder head off. Uh, it could be cracked, the gasket head could be warped, the rod bearings could have damage from wateryou see, that's the cool thing about cars.  One tiny little thing messes everything else up so nothing works! So it's up to us to figure it out!
Sounds good!
Have a good evening, gents.
Hi, BMO.
Sorry, BMO. I-I didn't mean to startle you. I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the truck... and biodiesel! Oh, and I figured out what's wrong with the engine block. So what are you working on?
Swe-e-e-et! You know, it's been really nice hanging with you fellas and working on the car.  It gets a little lonely at my space-age banana dome.
No. I-I don't want to be alone, but... I've gotten pretty good at it. I putter around the house, keeping busy with my little projects. But it would be nice to find someone.
Uh! Ah! I fixed it! Are we best friends yet?! Oh. Oh, hey. I-I fixed it.
I discovered the cylinder head was warped so I went to the junkyard and got a new one.  Bingo.
Yow-ee-wow.  She's beautiful.
Oh, no, that's okay. Having someone to love takes up time I could use to work on stuff.
What? Really?
