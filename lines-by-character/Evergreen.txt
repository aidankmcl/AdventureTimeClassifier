Discuss?! Are you listening, Chatsberry? Once this comet hits, everybody dies. Not just everybody, but us, but us!
Ahh, but this, Balthus, is no ordinary comet. Behold!
See how it writhes? It aches for our extinction. It!
We build a crown.
Like none seen before, or ever after! A magical crown whose phantasmal circuitry will bond to its first bearer and grant him his one deepest wish...  to destroy the hideous comet which threatens our world! The good news is I already built the crown. The bad news: it needs a power source.  The enchanted Ruby Eyes of the ancient lava dog, Magwood! And that's where you come in.
Well, that's just great. What about you, Slimy D?
Very well then. You leave me no choice.
Hmm! Doom you to no doom, maybe!  Gunther!  Pack my things, Gunther. We ride forth with Mount Magwood. You get to watch me save the world!  Gunther!  Come on, Gunther. Get your head in the game.
And he expects me to teach him the ways of magic? As if.
Hmm.
Hmm, it is quiet. Why don't you put on some music? The chimes, Gunther.
Gunther! I said chimes! Gunther, no!
Oh, never mind.  Here, take the jar and find me some water. There's not enough moisture in the air for me to make an ice camp.
Just do it. Don't anger Daddy.
No, but I stole your egg and mutated your brainget going!
Now, Gunther, listen to me. Don't follow me into Magwood's lair or else he'll melt your dome!
Oh, Gunther! You should see this!
Gunther, no! You failed; he'll melt your dome.
Not as grand as you once were, eh?
Ice!
This is why I don't teach you magic.
Gunther! The heck are you doing?! Get in here, Gunther! Oh, there you are, you blockhead. Quickly, take your position. We have precious little time. Once I complete the bonding chant, you deactivate the force field.  Bonding, bonding, three two one, you can do it, you can do it, three two one, bonding bonding. I did it! I  Come on, now, what did I ever do to you?!  Watch the columns, stupid! Whoops!  Easy now...  Oh, wow, did you see that?!  Ow, my bread balls!
Gunther?! Gunther, can you hear me?!
Okay, good. Now, aiming at the sound of my voice, throw the crown so it lands right on the top of my head.
No, no, there's no time! It must be you, Gunther!
Don't worry, it's easy. Even a mush-head like you couldn't donk it up too bad. Just focus on your deepest truest wish, the destruction of the deadly comet, and the rest will take care of itself.
Gunther? Buddy? What are you wishing for down there?  Gunther... no... That's the wrong wish! You've got to snap out of it! Use a concentration spell or, or a basic focusing charmlike I taught you... I mean, like I meant to teach you... I--
