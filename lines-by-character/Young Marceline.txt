Who are you guys?
Hambo is my only friend. See?  You need another eyeball surgery, pal. Lucky for you, we found a donor.  Eyeball! Nurse, hand me the string. Yes, doctor. It's our last piece. Hold still.  I'm hurting you because I love you.
What are you guys still doing here?
Nope, but there might be anything behind that cellar door, and it rhymes with memory core!
