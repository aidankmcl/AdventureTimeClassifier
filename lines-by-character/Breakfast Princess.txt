Huh?  Sis, give me the phone.   Oh, hey, Finn. I got another Ice King situation here. Oh, yeah? That would be great! Thanks.We are delighted to host this year's Princess Day in Breakfast Kingdom! Please enjoy the continental breakfast expertly prepared by our Breakfast Chefs. Now, on to more pressing matters. Brigands have been attacking our western seaports, dozens of unregistered princesses roam the land, and trade deficits are at an all-time high. Historically, Breakfast Kingdom has traded one sack of sugar a month to Slime Kingdom in exchange for four eggs, but egg production has plummeted!
You have an egg in you right now.
Oh, Lumpy Space Princess, I'm afraid you'll have to be patient with us and our petty disputes. Not all of us have achieved the self-sufficiency that I assume you have in your kingdom.  Oh wait, that's right. You don't have a kingdom! You live in a box in the woods.
Sorry, LSP, but the chair only recognizes real princesses, not bums.
Whatever, freeloader. If you were invited to Princess Day, it must have been a mistake or as a joke. Am I right, girls?
Okay, you've wasted enough of our time. Guards, take this pamplemousse out of my sight.
Okay. Now that the wannabe's gone, let's get back to princess business. O-Oh, n-not you, Princess Business. Uh, princess business. No, sounds the same. I'm sorry.
Okay, let's take a lunch break, everybody.  Oh, when I mean lunch, I, of course, mean breakfast.
Okay, I'll handle it.  Fellow princesses, I got to deal with matters of state. My little sister, Strudel Princess, will take over for me.
Stop right there!
LSP, is that you?
What's this for?
