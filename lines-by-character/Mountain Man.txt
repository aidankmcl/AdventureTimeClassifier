I am.
Yes, I am sad. Having been forced to watch roughhousing men for centuries.
Please! No roughhousing! It...m-makes...me...soooo.. SAD!
Because they're so rough on each other!
No! It's raunchy and maddening! All those men and their disgusting fantastic bodies!
Really? You'd do that for me?
No! That was terrible! Now theyre just punching animals! Its worse than before and its in no way a good solution!
Well you should be! Its not fair to those animals and its not fair to me! I might just start to cry again, you know?
Yes! Thank you Finn!
Thats okay. Only if you guys promise to stay healthy and not roughhouse after you rotate me.
Oh! Thank goodness! Alright kids, spin me the math around!
Huh? What? Really!?
Whats happening!
...Im ready.
Hey, I can't see anything! Is anyone roughhousing?
Radical.
Thank you Finn! You really helped everybody!
