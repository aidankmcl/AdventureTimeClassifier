Hey! I know you're here for my magical tears, but you won't have any, because I never cry.
What? Stop lying. You're here for my tears, aren't you?
You're just trying to make me feel sad so you can steal my tears when I cry... but I've got a heart of stone, buddy. I'm EVIL!
YOU'RE LYING!
You stink at lying.
Okay... I WILL HAVE IT MY WAY!!
Beg for mercy, or I'll kill you!
Whuh... What?
What? I can't hear you.
Bittersweet.
