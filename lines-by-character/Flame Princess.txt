I wanna see inside!   I love it!
Hmmmm...
Oh!  Do the thing that I like.
Thank you for building my new home, Finn. I'm so happy.
Yes.
Bye, Finn.
Ahhh.
Huh, ummm.
I'm okay. I'm okay.Uh! It's so confusing!
Hmm?  I thought Finn was a stand-up guy, you know? But he basically betrayed me.
Why do people even have secrets?
It's like that in the Fire Kingdom, too. Everyone is all deceitful and Shakespeare. But out here doesn't seem any different.  Why do I have to feel like this?  And what is that noise?! Grrr!
Are you spying on me?!
So, if you do your research, you'll know how to cut off my emotions so I won't feel like this?
Then I'll help you.
Yes. I'll do whatever it takes.
This is going to help me understand myself?
Oh. That's good... I guess.
Hello.
Yeah, but mostly I'm confused.
Really?
She is?!
What about the tests?
Yeah, I really get you, but sometimes friends are hard to understand. Sometimes you think you know them, but you find out they're just playing mind games.
I don't know.
Bah.  Ca'tle.
Kih, kih.
Is everybody in this world hiding something?
You're all right. Why can't everybody be honest like you? Maybe I should just go back where I belong.
I don't know, man.
Finn?
Pretty good. Cinnamon Bun and I staged a coup and I overthrew my dad.
That is the new way in the Fire Kingdom. Total honesty is the law of the landno secrets.
You never let me have any of those things! You were a selfish king and a bad parent!
You belong in that lamp! And if you don't settle down, you'll have to answer to Cinnamon Bun!
Finn, it's okay. It's in the past now.
No. I've realized my place is here, ruling these weak and vicious Fire People.
But we're cool. You're welcome to come back and hang out whenever you like if you promise me one thing.
That you'll be completely honest with me.
I'm serious.I don't know about eating, but it feels nice.
Finn.
Let me.
Why don't you get a room?!
Beat it, you freaky old trump!
Why'd you pick this spot?
Hmm...why do they?
No thanks.
What?!
What did you say to me?
It is in the tone of your voice.
I don't like being made fun of, Ice King. I don't like it at all!
It's only okay if the person making the fun is someone I'm cool with!
And they do it in a respectful and knowing way!
Oh, yeah? Then what's with that stupid smirking face?
I-I just need to burn a couple of forests or something. And get a good night's sleep.
Huh?  Dear Flame Princess, your feet smell like face cheeks, your stupid candles smell heinous, and you can't even kiss Finn without totes freakin' out!
Inferno...shot!
Stop that!
Ice King! You can't escape me!
Finn!
I'm so, so sorry, Finn! Are you alright?
So, you wrote that letter?
Shh. I should have known. That letter said things in it that only you would know. Personal things, Finn. And you used them against me. I thought you were the one person I could- I need some time alone.Don't ever mess with me again!
Oh.
Aaahh!
Huh?
Ah!
Ow!
Yes! That's all you've done!  Are you trying to hurt me?! Is that why you're following me?!
I am ambushing you!
Huh? Why do you torment me?
I...
Rggh! Enough. You should not toy with the emotions of a fire elemental.
You told me you liked me, and you made my flame grow brighter, but then you put me out, with your heart!
You're trying to impede me. That must be your purpose, ...but fire's purpose is to burn, so I'm going to turn this land into my fire kingdom!
It's really starting to come together. Needs more... fire... hmm.
I've heard this all before.
You... MEANIE!
Ah!
Ah! Whyyyy?!
AH!
That is the last time you hurt me.  RAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!
RAAAAAAAAAHH!
Ow!  Huh?
Oh.
I understand now. You're a water elemental.
You're my opposite. You create water.
Yeah, you cry and cry all the time.
That's your power.
Finn, even if we like each other, we're going to hurt each other.
You would defy nature for me?
Bye, Finn.Yes
You guys are full of magic air.
Yeah... It's just the air smells bad from your magic tricks, and now I feel sad.  I left all my scented candles at the castle. They'd really cut through the magic stink.
Then I'll have to see my dad. I'm still mad at him for imprisoning me in that lantern. So UNFAIR!
Really? That would be really nice.  But don't let my Pops see you. I don't want His Majesty thinking I need anything from him.
Aah!Oooh...
Oooh...
Hmmm...
I'm so happy! I'm so happy to meet you, Prince. You're my Prince.
Stop whispering!
We're... what?
You... WHAT?!
You! What's wrong with me, huh?! You don't like me?!
What's wrong with you?!
Don't ever mess with me again!Oh, hey, you came! I got worried because you didn't answer special occasion phone. My relatives are waiting inside.
Well, that's why I called on special occasion phone. All my less-evil family members are here for dinner. Come eat!
Finn, this is my family.  These are my two younger brothers, my brother who's home from the military, and my judgmental aunt and uncle.
Hold on, bro. Perhaps it is a non-flameish custom unknown to us.
What are you doing?!
Oh, my Bjork! No! I don't want to see more! Wait, what's that in your mouth? Jake?
Are you controlling Finn?
And you made him dance like a baby, semi-nude, in front of my family? Wow, that's pretty hardcore.
Good luck, Finn. Hope you win!Come on, honey. Eat your soup.
EAT IT NOW!!!It's as I feared. The magma in the kingdom's core is cooling down, weakening the life force of our Flame Citizens. I've gathered you here to figure out how to stop this. We need ideas, people!
Randy, you are here to stay safe only. Eat your snacks.
That's ridiculous, aunt Agnes.
Cinnamon Bun, what are you doing?
You don't have a nose.
Well, whatever it is, it won't go away if you don't stop fiddling with it.
I'm prepared to do what I need to as a leader. Nothing is off the table, but we need Princess Bubblegum as an ally right now. She might be able to help us solve this.
Quickly, CB, take me to the core entrance.
Hello, Bubblegum. Thank you for coming.
Don't act like you're my friend, PB! You're here to help save my kingdom, not because I trust you.
We're in the midst of unnatural cold season, but the cause has us stumped.  My people are really freaking out.
Hmmm...
Behind these doors are the most secret relics in the Fire Kingdom. Forbidden to outsiders. Come on.
Alright, but don't touch anything!  These are the sleeping Fire Giants. They're the ancient protectors of the Fire Kingdom. Their existence is known only to those of the royal line, and their story has been passed down through the generations.
With them, I can remake a white-hot new Fire Kingdom. They are our last resort, our greatest weapons. Huh?  Hey! I said no touching!
Huh, strange. The access panel's lock must have corroded.
What?!
You are way out of line, Bubblegum! You have no control here!  I do!
Nooooo!
Come out in the open and face me like a princess!
So that gives you the right  to donk up my people's future?!  I won't let you continue to usurp my authority!
Why can't you just trust me?!
So be it.
You're never going to change, are you? You'll just keep walking all over us little people!  But not today.
Yeah, right.
But how did you find out about them?
You're still spying on me?
You're cold, PB!
And it's not because you're a scientist or leader; it's because you are a bad person! Something inside you is messed up, girl. And whatever it is,  whatever, whatever, PB!
You better not be fibbing.  It's Phoebe. My first name is Phoebe. You, uh, asked earlier.Next.
Take this fortifier. It should last you through the cold season.
Thank you.
Who's next?
Don Johnthe Flame Lord!
Excuse me? How dare you!   What?
You've been poisoning me. How could you, Ursula? Guards!
Huh?
No!
Cinnamon Bun!
I can't leave. I have to fight for my kingdom!
Thanks, CB.
A little better, I think.
I don't trust her.
Well, I've seen Finn battle huge monsters and even armies, and we need somebody who can fight... CB, take me to Finn.
Finn!
Finn, I've been slowly poisoned by my treacherous handmaiden. Now my powers are weakened, andand the Flame Lord has freed my father and threatened to marry me. But I escaped with CB.
Listen, Finn, this doesn't mean we're getting back together. We're all business.
I'm feeling exhausted. Where can I freshen up?
Oh, thanks.
Alright, guys, let's wolf.
No funny stuff.
What are you doing?!
No, Finn, don't hurt them! They're entranced!
Never!
No!
I can never marry you, because I don't even know you, much less like you, and forcing me to marry you is gross.
CB, are you okay?
Oh, come on.
Thank you.Nothing, I don't know.
Father!
Ugh, he's so annoying.
Oh, not you, Jake, my dad. I always catch him whispering stuff in my ear while I'm not paying attention. He keeps saying I'm evil.
How can I know for sure?
What?
And that will make me good?
Ok, yeah, let's do it.
Dungeons!
Is this how you look for a dungeon?
I'll just use my heat sense.
That tree over there is not made of wood.
Thanks for taking me out Finn.
Oh, sure. Um... do we need a torch? I'm sort of made of fire.
Oh, okay.
Boy, this place is creepy!
Oh, you mean, like, with all the skulls?
What?
Burning you alive!
Neat!
Yeah, no, that makes sense.
Mhm.
Race you to the next monster!
What?
Sneak?
Wow.
Yeah.
Uhh... what?
Uhh...
Well, I don't know! I've never rated myself before.
Are you okay?
Oh. Neat. So, uhh, should we keep going?
I was meditating.
A key!
We have to go back?
Okay.
Jeez. This is kinda boring. At least he's walking fast.
Scatter fire!
He... wanted me to take his place.
Finn, I'm not having any fun.
Well, you keep wanting me to do things your way. But I don't like doing things your way. Is that because I am evil?
Really?
I... burn it down.
RRAAAAAGGGHHH!!
Thanks, FTH! Haa!  Ughh, doors! Burn, burn, burn!  Huh? Ugh.
Uhh... snake fire!!
Yes! Feel my flames, puny worms!  The power of destruction!
Huh?
Release him or feel the wrath of the Princess of Flames!
Very well.
Do the splits! Do the splits, thou milk-livered maggot pie!
No way! I'd never do that to my boyfriend.
Ha, thanks Finn. That was a really awesome experience.
I forget how good it feels to destroy stuff.
I mean, like evil stuff.
We should go again sometimes. Do you know any other dungeons?
And burn it.
