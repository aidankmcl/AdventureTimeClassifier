Who's the heck happening? What?
Oh, okay. Let's see your ring.
Come on in. Follow this guy.
My boss is gonna be real psyched I found someone to buy his apples. A whole crate.
What's wrong, guy?
Oh, ya didn't mean diamonds? All ne'er-do-wells call diamonds apples. Like calling money bread or rock-knockers butter-slaps.
They're here for the apples.
Feed 'em to the pig.
