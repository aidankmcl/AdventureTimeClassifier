Yo, my lab got creamed! I had to dummy-rig an alchemical filter out of a dirty bidet and a vaporizer!
Heck yeah! Ron James always delivers! Check it out, brotha! Yaah!  In your face!
My lab conditions were not ideal.
Peace, man! Aaah!Whazzup!
A'ight, listen up, brahs. Here's the plan.
We're heading for Big Butt Rock. At sundown, we'll gather on the Cheek's Peak, and using the ah-has, deep feels, and woo-woos we score from the journey, we will chant a totally original spell, thus forming an entirely new school of magic!  Kind of like those jerky secret societies, but less jerky.
Hey, ladies! Hellooo.
Well, this ain't goin' the way we planned, but fate has decreed that this place is just what we need. Draw your inspiration from this muddy, old cow pasture. Here, bros.  We got a stock full of T.P. and magic ink.
Look who's talking.
I was hoping it wouldn't come to this. My last resort poshe, obtained from a mad yogi in the Mystery Mountains. It's time to find out what it does.  Ba-bam!Welcome, brothers! Sorry about that biz outside.
All right, bros. Ronny James got mad spells for wizards of all exps. No need for memorization, incantation, or hard-to-find bularoo. Just rip one of these babies open, and you'll be like, ta-da! We got a bottle-returns program and all that shwazaa. So, wha-za?
Heck, yeah, brah. I got something.  Oof!  This baby right here  right here?  This is what you want, brothers.
It works by magic. It's a spell.
It's my secret brew, dawg.
It's a cold spell.
MAGIC.
Y'all is fakes!
Bam!
