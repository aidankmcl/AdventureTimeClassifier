Thieves! It's the City of Thieves! Be warned boy! All who enter the city are destined to be come thieves themselves!  Even you.
Be warned!
...of Thieves!
Heed my warning boy: enter the city, and you'll come out a thief!
Oh, what did I tell you, boy? This city will get you, no matter how pure you think you are!  I was right.
