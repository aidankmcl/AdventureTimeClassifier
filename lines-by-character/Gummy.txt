Nyaaar! Great job, warriors! You've freed us. I am Gummy, royal goblin chief of staff.
Nyaan! I'm sorry. I have not known a friendly touch in some time. You see, Xergiok loved to be a jerk to us...
We need a good king to rule us, like you mayhaps?
Please, Finn,  we need a king.
We have a new king!
Allow me to show you the grounds, Your Majesties.
The Goblin Birthing Pits, Your Majesties.
The Garden of Living Fountains.
The Royal Game Archive, complete with controller hats.
The Royal Dragon Stables.
And finally, the royal bedroom, with king-sized bed for the royal couple.
Yes, my queen. Whisper Dan.
Wait! For you, great king, the Book of Royal Rules.
Oh, no worries, my Liege. I'll read it to you.
Introduction, colon, the 623 royal rules were established in moon year 16, in response to Elder Gorflox's repeated requests for an organized...  Awaken, Your Highness!
Your Excellency! Let's go. We have much to do!
This is where you may perform your daily processes, my king
Come, sire, it is time to brush your teeth in the front of the boy style mirror.
Spare them, Your Majesty! Spank me instead!  Set my buttocks ablaze!
Rule 1: The king shall not brush his own teeth... in the book of royal rules I read to you last night.
So then... we may brush your teeth, my lord?
Uhhh, I will cut that, Your Highness.
I'm sorry, sire. The royal rules don't allow it.
No!
Uhhhhh, a thousand pardons, my lord. You're not going to chew that, are you?
I'm sorry, sire. The royal rules don't allow it.
I would know.
Master, eat your food. I chewed thoroughly and heated it to goblin body temperature.
You look a little bit down. Would you like me to weep for you?
No, sire! The king is not allowed to fight. He must give a speech to the thief. That is the royal rule, my Liege.  There's the thief!
Nooooooo!  The Royal Speaker must give the speech.
Ya see?
Yes, you can feel it slowly working, eh?
No. No more spankings...  Aaaahh!!!!
My lord, I'm sorry, y-you haven't heard? Xergiok is returning with an evil army. Come look through the scope!  You see?
Ohhh...
I'm going to be honest with you, king Finn. When I'm scared, I feel most safe in your lap.
Oh, great king, with the help of a brave soldier, you thwarted the evil Xergiok.
