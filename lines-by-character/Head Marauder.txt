You can't just walk away from a roughhouse!
Aw! Finn! Ready to get destroyed!
Whoa whoa whoa!  What are you talking about Finn?
Whoa! Hey, hey. Shh. It's all right fellas. Finn, I'm sure this tone down the roughing thing has something to do with your boom boom, and I can respect that, but how can we POSSIBLY, Make roughhousing, Less rough?!
Finn!  You're really mixin' things up in the best of ways today!
Hey Finn! Hey man. As you can see the petting got sorta out of hand.  Stop that! We are done with that! Were going back to roughhousing!
Well we dont like not roughhousing! Ya see the problem here?
Sounds fine with me!
