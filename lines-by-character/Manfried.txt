Take a chill pill, Princess. I handled it.
You know. Someone drove their car in the door, but no one was driving, and it exploded, so I handled it.All present and accounted for.
You're welcome.
Find out about what, Finn?
What?
Oh, thank goodness.Boy, it's sure quiet in there. What's going on in there, you think?
Okey-dokey, everybody! Check it out!
Once in place, this sweater will muffle the cannonball explosion perfectly, allowing the frame around the door to gently fall apart, freeing Finn and PB.
Now the cannon should go right over here.  Oh, wait. Here.
Okay, everyone, prepare for the boom.
Three... two...
Uh-oh.Bwaaa bwaaa bwaaaaaa!  Announcing the arrival of the Earl of Lemongrab!Princess Bubblegum, you're needed at once in the Grand Hall.
Gosh, I'm sorry.
