No, his ex-girlfriend.
Billy and I broke up four years ago, but I held on to this.
After Billy died, I couldn't keep it in my place anymore. I heard you guys were friends, so when I saw your name on the rap battle flyer, I thought it would be cool to bring it to you.
No, I can't.
Shouldn't Jake be here?
Huh? Oh. Well, I loved Billy, and I believed in him, but then Billy stopped believing, and that jammed up our whole dealbeing a top-tier, red-belt power couple. After a while, all he did was watch movies and play video games. Pretty lame, right? So I bailed.
Yeah, I know. I heard he was making a comeback, too. What a weird world.
What the?
It looks like Billy's bucket list.
I don't know.
What's that?
Are you sure you're okay?
That was awesome, Finn. You know, you remind me of Billy when he was young.
I have a feeling our paths will cross again. Take care, Finn.
