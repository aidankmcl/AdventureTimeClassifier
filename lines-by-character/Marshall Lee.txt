Oh, hey Fionna.
Oh, forgive me! Hello, your majesty!
What? Is he kidding?
What a wad.
Let's ditch him!
Lumpy Space Prince is throwing a party in the woods! It's gonna be freaky nasty!
I know you're gonna say yes to me, so... Let's just go.
This looks fun... bunch. Come on.
Follow my lead.
Don't you know I'm a villain? Every night I'm out killin', sending everyone runnin' like children. I know why you're mad at me. I've got demon eyes, and they're looking right through your anatomy... into your deepest fears. Baby, I'm not from here. I'm from the Nightosphere... To me, you're clear. Transparent. You got a thing for me, girl; it's apparent.
Not so bad? I'm the son of a demon... and the Vampire King. It's not something I have to try at. You on the other hand...
What?  Like him?
Oh no...
Out of my way, kitty.
Oh, come on! That was funny!
Hey! Come on... where you goin'? What's the deal? You're missing the party! Fionna, lighten up!
Oh, really? Well, what if I just take her right now, you know?
Unexpected!
You want your Cake back? Come and get her!
Did you think I was lying? I said I'm evil, without even trying!  Already dead, so I'm not scared of dying... Drinking the red from your heart in one sitting. You think you've got me pegged, you must be kidding. I raise the dead up, and they do my bidding. Girl, I'm a thousand years old, I'm a riddle... Bad little boy! Yes, I'm bad, but not little.
Oh, this is bad, guys... This is really bad!
This is it for me, Fionna... so... why don't you just admit it...? You're in love with me...
Faking it! Faking it! Okay, my shirt is, like, filled with cream puffs!
Glob, Fionna... you're like the realest person I've ever met...  Ow, my cheek meat!
Quit clowning, Fionna. F-Fionna? Fionna!
