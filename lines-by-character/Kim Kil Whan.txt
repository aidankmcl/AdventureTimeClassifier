Hm.
Dad! We have new business to discuss.
Birthdays are old business.
Things? Things have switched hands.
Dad, when I say that things have switched hands, I mean to say that things you have previously claimed ownership of have transferred from your hands to my hands, in that...  I bought your tree house.
What: the deed to your tree house. How: acquired through legal trade. From whom: the deed's previous owner, Marceline The Vampire Queen...  in exchange for one lunatic bass.
When: effective immediately.
We will convene at the property.
Sorry I'm late. Okay. So, as the deed holder of this tree house, I am now your landlord. The first thing  I'm going to have to do is assess your treasure room.
I'm sorry, Dad. Deeds don't bleed.
Woof.  Alright, so I guess this is the apartment the two of you can afford. It's a ladder.  Yeah? Yeah. Send them on over.  Sorry about that.  Anyway, as you can see, this beauty offers direct first- and second-floor access, superb craftsmanship, and et cetera. I... suppose you're familiar. Yes, Finn?
What?
Excuse me.  Good afternoon. Yes, right this way.  I've got 37 available units to show in this building, so we're gonna want to get right to it. Please step inside. There we go. Is that everyone? Good, good. Please make your way upstairs, and we'll begin the tour. And, you two, go ahead and make yourselves at home. Rent's due on the 1st. No overnight guests. Oh, and flush once after you boom-boom but before you start using the TP, and then once more in the middle of using the TP if you're going to use a lot. It's... easier on the pipes. Okay, call me if you need me.
Yeah, real awesome.
This is a bill for the bail I just paid.
You're really in it deep, here, Dad. It's time for you to get real. Get a job. No more games.
Oh, yes, yes, absolutely. Small pets are allowed with an additional deposit.
Excellent.
Excuse me.
Oh, yeah? With what?
Oh, I see. With the gold you dug out of my lawn, which is therefore mine.  Now, since I have a job, I must be going. Ciao.  And fill in that hole.
Dad? What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
Really?
Oh.
Thank, Dad.
I suppose I could accept the ocarina as legal trade.  The tree house is yours, Dad.
Take care, Dad. I'll call.
Okay, bye, Dad.
Eh, all right, I guess. I don't know. He still lives the life of a child. I mean, it's his choice, but I really thought if he got a job and moved out of that tree house, it could have put some fire under him.
No, I think I was wrong about Dad. I think he's good.
