Shhh-sh-sh-sh-shhhh. You know who I am?
I'm the chief.
Shhhh... before you talk to the chief, you must party with the chief.
It is the only way.
But you haven't been partying.
You move to music, but that's not dancing. You chew pancakes, but you're not tasting. To truly party, one must leave behind the problems that are troubling  and open one's  mind eye.  I'm just kiddin'. You guys are party animals.  This is just a sticker!  You can stay in our cave as long as you want.
Oh, yeah. That makes sense. It's definitely the weirdest cave I've ever seen. Heh heh.
Nah, we love it here.
Attention. Attention, everybody. Can I have your attention, please?  So... apparently we're not in a cave.
We're in a... MONSTER'S BELLY!
Well, there's the dark and mysterious mine, but nobody uses it anymore.
No. To survive, my people need a phat party club to grind in. That monster's gut was totally excellent.
Hear me, monster. My people and I wish to party inside you once more. Prithee take us upon thine gut and we shall party no more with fireworks but instead  with gentle lasers!I thought Billy was your hero.
