Jake the Dog, we have your daughter. She is safefor now.
We need you to reassemble your old teamGareth, a.k.a. The Lady Master, the Flying Lettuce Brothers, notorious con-men impressionists and your old friend, Tiffany.
You'll need them to break in the Royal Candy Vault and steal this.
You're the only master thief with the skills to swipe it. You have until midnight to make the drop. Tell anyone and Jake Jr. gets it.
Stop right there.
Throw me the Baker's Shardand I'll let her go.
