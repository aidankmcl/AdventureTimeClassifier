Oh, yeah! Mmmm!
You guys! Marshall Lee's gonna play a song, you guys!By the window!
By the window!
For from the window shall I shower the poor with presents, as is my altruistic nature. Haha!
Eat! Eat, my children!
Where am I?
Who's there? Reveal yourself!
Hmm... Citizens of this realm, I am the one and only heir to the throne of the Lumpy Space Kingdom- I mean, I used to be. I rebelled against my parents, and now i'm a refugee.  What's that? You wish to help me? I am touched! Fetch me some clothes and I'll pay you handsomely, by petting you. First, I need freaky clothes! Cool freaky, not monster freaky. Oh yes, and something to read as well, something mind-blowing.
Oh wait! I also need servants! Recruit some locals, they work fine.
Hmm... Not bad! Well done, my child! Next!
Massenpsychologie und Ich-Analyse. That does sound mind-blowing!
Hey! Those were my servants!
What an innocent face!  It shines as if you have done no wrong! Do you like my freaky clothes?
You don't?  Finally, someone who's not impressed with my noble looks, but admire's what's inside of me!
Is this really happening? You're clothes are so raggedy and soiled! And yet, you use them as a napkin!  You care not about your personal appearance nor hygiene!
Dress me in the fashion of this peasant!
I have much to learn from you, Fionna the Human.
Hmm... Your movements are so free! My parents only want me to fly like a proper monster: stiff and rigid, with a sharp toothed scowl permanently in place. But now, I see a new way to move.  Dance with me?
Uh...No!
Release!
You were under my handsome spell for a moment. We can never marry, you know? I can only be with someone who is my equal in every way , a person so much like me that she doesn't even exist!
Ooh! I'll have one!
So rusty... So humble...
Delightful!
Wait, where're your baby tables?
What!?  You don't dip your foods in gold before eating?
Great Glob! What is this? So charming! So quaint! So self-reliant!
For years, I thought only of the needs of my people, but what about me? What do I need? This poorly made sandwich has enlightened me!
What I want is to be like you, Fionna the peasant! And I'll need you as my pet, Cake the cat.
Huh?
Flee, noble Fionna, for it is my stupid parents! And they're fatter than ever!
Ahh! I'm just being honest!
Huh?
You're right, Fionna! This is my destiny!
I do have the power!
Huh?
Fionna!
My heart!
No! It isn't right!
Urh, Fionna, This is the end for me. But at least I made you proud, didn't I?
My glob, Fionna! You've been telling be the answer all along!  The only way to defeat parental disapproval is not caring about anything! I don't care!
I don't care!
I don't care...
I don't care!
Fionna, Cake. Both of you buy me dinner.
