Candy...
I've got a closing argument tomorrow, Root Beer Guy.
Not really.
Okay, sweetie, that sounds like an interesting dream.
You need to eat something before you go to work. And you can't keep falling asleep at your typewriter; it's bad for your back. Besides, I miss you at night.
Peeking through the bushes?! You've been warping your mind with all this mystery stuff. I swear, sometimes I think you love that novel of yours more than you love me. You've been working on it every night for ten years and for WHAT? Look at me, Root Beer Guy. I'm a Cherry Cream Soda and I have the same needs as any other Cherry Cream Soda! Or even diet cream soda.
Bonsoir, monsieur Good evening, sir. Would you like me to turn down ze bed?
Finn and Jake would never do that!
I told them. That's right, I did it for us. Oh, this thing is eating you alive, Root Beer Guy!
That was a great night , baby.
I'm so proud of you, Mr. Captain of the Banana Guards.
