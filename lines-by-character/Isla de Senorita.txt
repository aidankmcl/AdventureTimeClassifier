Oh, hello there!
Is my singing bothering you?
...What?!
What?
...What?
I asked if my singing was bothering you.
I always sing when by boyfriend is away.
Yeah, Party God, do you know him?
Oh no, that's him, quick hide! He gets crazy jealous!
Hi.
Oh, you wanna hang before you go?
Oh, well it would just be for a minute.
Okay
I won't- I'm not.
Oh, he's okay... sometimes.
I know.
Neglected lovers party of two!
Well, I like you. You're welcome to stay here as long as you want.
Yes, I appreciate your company.
I don't even matter to Party God, he just parties all the time. He doesn't even notice if I'm there or not.
Sometimes, I wish he would just go into outer space so I'd never have to see him again.
Yeah, that's true.
...I'm gonna break up with him!
Hey, babe, I have to tell you something.  Uh, babe?
Oh, that just washed up on me after a storm.
Well, I've been doing some thinking. And I- I...
I I... hope you have fun at your party...
Uh...
I-
Party God?
Did Ice King tell you to come talk to me?
Oh...
Uh, nope- I'm good!
W-well, y-yes. You're bad and I'm terminating our romance! Bam, get out of my face! Wow, I never would have been able to do that without the advice from my emotionally mature friend, Ice King.
Mmm, that's nice.
Oh, okay.
Whew.
