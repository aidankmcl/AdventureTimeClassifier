Hello?
I think we can spot a member of our own species, Jake. We're not blind.
Yes, I guess we are a little blind.
Jake, what is that thing that's talking?
Jake, please ask your goblin butler to stop insulting my heritage!
Thank you, Jake. I'm glad the wife and I made the trip from the Crystal Dimension.
Ethel...
Shh.  Thank you, Jake, for being interested in our daughter!
Jake, do you know Cameladabalawabapp?
Cameladabalawabapp!
Hmm. Bold move letting your opponent move first, Jake. I respect that. Very well. Cameladabalawabapp!!
Haha! Your turn, Jake!
Yes. Subtle.
How about we play some more traditional rainicorn games, my boy?
Yeah, we're about ready to break out our picnic basket and dig in!
What?! Wow! So wealthy, and so generous!
YAAAAAY! HA-HEEEY! HURRAAAAY!
It's just we thought we'd never get another chance. We thought humans were extinct.
