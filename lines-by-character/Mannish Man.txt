Finn... Jake... You made it!
Trial? Oh, no!  I'm Mannish Man, the minotaur.
Yeah. Come on. Let's go check it out.  Woohoo!
We've been watching you guys on our magical viewing globe. Take a seat guys, have some juice. There's grape and apple and the gatekeeper made spaghetti. And... Alright, Finn. Are you ready for this?
You deserve it, Finn.
Yeah, Finn. You're the goodest of heart and most righteous hero I've seen here. Tenderness, ingenuity, bravery, nard-kicking ability, and when you took that giant ogre's dollar...  Oh, man! The Key-per nearly fainted!
Hey. Don't tell her, Finn.
