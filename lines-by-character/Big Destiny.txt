Snap! Huh? What is this?  Are you tellin' me what to wear, Trami?
You think I should reinvent my style and put a stupid thing on my head?!
Otherwise you would dress like an idiot! Bam! Crown shorts!
Yeah-ha-ha!
Tromo! Jack up crazy lady! Trami! Take mule back to crib for din-din.
See you soon, bad-style Junktown!
You want Big D's crown, huh?
Here ya go then.
That is your final possession, the last thing you will ever own.
Look down there, stupid.
Town is on fire! See? I made it on fire! Fix up Junktown! Look at old man cry!  That's what happens when you mess with Big D! You get crushed! Your family get crushed! Booya!
Yeah! How did I even get here, son?!
I am Big D! Wooooo!Big D's chillin' over here, wasteland style.
