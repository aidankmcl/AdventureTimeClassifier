I'm Braco, and I was born to court the Princess Bubblegum.
21 years. I inherited my father's place in line after his ascension.
Yes,  my heart instructs me so.
I was born for this. Love will win on this day.
Son of Loghan, who was begat by Hobus.
I want to take you... on a date.
Princess, I love you! I-I love you so much it hurts.  The pain itHuh?.
No, Princess! What I feel is real! Meet me in the garden tonight  and unlock the mystery  of meee!
Come to me tonight.
Yes, Princess.
Oh, look,  a miracle of nature like you.
Uh-huh.
Aww,  N-Nope, no. No tears for Braco! What did she say? I have what I need for now. So she will see me again!  I shall not falter, Papa! .
Dear personal diary, in a consequence of my latest romantic misfortune,  I decided to consult the man who knew best about her majesty,  father's father. Amongst his dearest possessions, he kept a book containing every secret of seduction through superficiality.
The art of peacocking.
I know right.  I am peacocking you to rally your attention.
Ummm, so what's that on your head?
Oh, uhh
Oww.
Princess! Ahhh.
Dear personal diary, I am in terrible pain.  AAAAAAAHH! She is in her castle somewhere, a lonely heart. Do not fear, Princess;  I won't let you down .
Jake and Finn, I seek your aid. I need to ask you for that map, therewith I can bring the soul stone to Bubblegum. Then she'll love me!
Oh, oh,  thank you!
Ah! Oh! Uhhh.
Oddsbodikins!  AHHHHH!
Uhhh.
The soul stone. This journey has come to an end.
For the one I love.
Guess who.
Oh, look, can it be?  It's a soul stone!
Hmmm,  WHY WON'T SHE LOVE ME?!  Ahhh!
Ahhhh!
Yeah, man, I'm throwing the towel.
Then you must help me... to crack the nut.
I'll pay any price... for love!
Waaahhh! .
Am I a walking love magnet?
To the princess, then!
I'm here!
I paid the price for love, was it worth it? Do you love me?
Then marry me! We'll travel the world, have adventures, make the babes, get fat and weird, and float up to 50th Dead World, right?
Uhhh, this feels super-wrong.
Okay!  Thank you, Princess!  Woohoo!
