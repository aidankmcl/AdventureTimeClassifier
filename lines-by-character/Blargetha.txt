Attention, my loyal slimejects!
My husband would like to say something. And, uh, he would, too, if not for his extremely sore throat. So I will say it for him. We challenge you to the Trials of Glarb.
Hmm? Okay, Guillermo. I'll ask, I'll ask. Uh, Guillermo still has a sore throat! Uh, may I sing on, uh, his behalf?
I want to touch your hand with my hand. I want to rub your cheek with my cheek. Maybe later we can get Do not disturb. I'm done!
Huh! Huh! Huh!
Yes! I love you, baby. You spoon so good!
He says Eat a fat dollop and buzz off!
Finn, you shouldn't break in to a woman's room.
Huh?
Uh-oh.
You don't know how hard it is to be this hot. Women don't want to talk to you, because they're intimidated, and guys don't want to talk to you, because they're too scared. You're alone in the hottest, most sexiest prison. So I stuck some olives in a glob of gelatin and called it my lover.
