Y-yeah, uh, you used to call me that quite a bit.
Mm.
Business, uh, actually. I own my own company, bottling and distributing Lumpy gas.
And I'm up for a big contract, uh, here in the kingdom, which could really help my business take off, so to speak.
To be honest, I'm a little nervous about this meeting tomorrow.
I'm bad at talking to people.
Really?
Boy, LSP, heh, you sure are making me feel good about myself.
I'm sub-letting a friend's apartment.
That chairoh, it used to be over there, but I moved it.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Heh-heh, yeah!
It's his face, but on your body!
Boy, when this evening started, I was feeling so dump trucks, but now it's like a hundred forklifts!
Do you feel this couch?
'Cause it's where you're gonna sleep!
Seriously. It's getting late, and I don't want you walking home. So I insist. I'll be in the other room, sleeping peacefully... and dreaming about you.
Thank you... for everything.
Good night!
Rise and shine! I hope you like pancakes 'cause I got  oh.  I guess she'll be the one who got away.
You're still here!
Nope! My GF is back at my place sending me good vibes.
I did it, babe! I landed the sale!
And I couldn't have done it without you.
And here's the best part! She wants me back at the castle tonight to go over the contracts during a royal dinner.
Oh. No. It's a business meeting, not social. Just me and the princess, I'm afraid.
LSP?
Oh, it's just great. I met this amazing purple girl at the Candy Tavern.
Can I help?
Okay.
What are you doing here?
What?
