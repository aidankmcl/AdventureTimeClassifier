Help!
Oh! Thank you, Finn and Jake! Especially you, Finn.Thank you so much, Finn!  I should give you a kiss!That's a distress flare from my other Hot Dog Knights. I sent them to rescue my other other Hot Dog Knights who got trapped in a labyrinth! Their message says... Baby... us... trouble... time.... They must be in grave danger!  Hot Dog Knights are slow.
