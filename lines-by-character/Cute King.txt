Peep!
We're not cute! We're evil, ...and we're here to dominate you!
Enough! Now... bow down to me, Cute King, and my legion of Cuties!
Since you won't take us seriously, we will kill you. Until then, enjoy your burrito, Jake.
No... My men! Quickly, men! Pick yourselves up before the enemy sees!  Come on, now. That's it. Easy does it.  Bravest warriors! I ask you: must we have our butts handed to us by everyone we meet?! How will we ever splash around in the brains of our enemies if you guys can't take two steps without exploding?! Bliblob, I'm lookin' at you!  Can I please just get one victory?! ONCE?!  Now don't start that.  Don't you do it!
YAAAAH!
Victory... is... OURS!  Finally. I can do the victory dance!  La! La-da! La-da-da la! La-da-da la da!  La-la-da-la-la-la!
No...  This is ketchup?!
It doesn't matter now. No one will ever fear our strength.
Can I use it to control others?
Show me where to start.
I command you to make me a sandwich!
What about now?
