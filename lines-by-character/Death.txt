I've got you in my sights, Simon.
Get real, man. You're gonna be the Ice King till the sun blows up. This is your one chance. I made a mix tape for the ride: Summer Jams 3!
Eh, fair enough. See you in a few.
You got about 15 seconds.
You lose, Simon. Sorry, man.Hey! Hey! I see you!
Who are you?
What do you mean, youre in my castle!
You must leave this place. Now!
Another one, be gone mortal!
You cant kick me because your brain is stupid!
Alright.  Pick an instrument.
To get stuff from me, you have to beat me in a musical battle. But Jakes the musical one! And hes got poo brain!
I dont care.
So the contest begins!
Hey, alright, so, who do you think won?
Im going to kill you now.
Those are the rules in the Land of the Dead, lose a music battle, lose your life.
What? You know Peppermint Butler?!
Heh heh heh! Yo, you guys can have whatever you want!  Jake, stand up!

Kiss of death, baby. You got your memory back.
Now I shall return the soul of this.
