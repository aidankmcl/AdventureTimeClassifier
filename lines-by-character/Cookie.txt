Donkin' Princess...
No... no!  Don't play games with me, Princess. I want that crown. No crown, no hostages.
No, Princess! You are problemthe problem princess!  Just gimme that crown!
Hello?! Who the heck are you?  I'm gonna smash your face.
Huh? Oh. I thought maybe you were a spy guy or somethin'. Go ahead, give everyone some milk, then get the math outta here.
Go ahead, Chipper. Over.
Hold tight, Chipper. Chipler's on his way.  You got that, Chipler?
What? Oh. Look, you should probably split, buddy. Things are about to get pretty flipped out in here.
Wait, you hate Princess Bubblegum, too? Get outta here!
Waitcostume?!
Boy, I hear ya, brother.
Yeah. Go ahead, Chipolina. Over.
Okay. Over.
I was just a kid, man, just a little kid, when I got doodied on.
I was the new guy at the Candy Orphanage. They called me Baby Snaps. I tried to make friends with the other kids...
They were always too depressed to play.
Things went on like that for a while, then... one day...  she showed up.  Everything was different.
Everything was-was better with her around. And something inside me changed that day, too. And then later she told me I could be anything I wanted.
And I told her I wanted to be a princess like her, so I could make all the children happy.
And she laughed in my face, man! It really messed me up.
She LIED to me!
No, she just wants to hog all the princessin' for herself!  All chips, report in. It's time to get real! Over.  Chips. Chips. Over.  Chips! Where are my chips?! Chipolina! Chipler! Chipton! Chipper! Is anyone there?! Chipface? Something happened to my chips!  AAAAH!  I'm about to flip out, man... and take that crown!
My own kingdom?
I... I'd like that.
Oh, boy! Would ya look at that?
Dang!
Hot diggity!
What are we gonna do?
Whoa! Ha HA! You're magic!
We're really doing it!
No, Jake. Stop the horse.
I'm done for, Jake.
No, Jake.
Thank you for your help, but it's too late for me.
I'll never be a princess. At least for a moment, you helped me feel like a princess. It was wonderful.  Thank you, Jake.
You know what? It's funny, but you sort of remind me of a mailman I used to know.
Yep.
I glubbed up!
Knight to E-5.
Jake!
