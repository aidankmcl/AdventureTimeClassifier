Mr. Cupcake, truth or dare?
I dare you to take off your wrapper.
What is this game you are playing at now, Finn?
Oh, it is so tasty.There's no lush, green field in that closet!
Just tell us what you hear!
Suck it back out! Suck it back out!
Aren't you worried about Finn?
It will be okay, Jake.
Oui, it's true. I have the gift.  Yes. I sense their spirits.
Finn says... He says, Remember to feed BMO.
