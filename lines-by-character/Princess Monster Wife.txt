What happened to them, husband?
Okay.
Hahahahaha!
Is there something wrong with me? The way I am...it's not normal... is it?
I don't think I understand...
Oh...
Hi there!
I need a glass of water.
No, it's okay. I'll get it.
You are not normal! You are a  monster!
Monster! A monster!
I don't feel beautiful. I feel like a freak!
You should just find another princess to marry. I'm unlovable!
You don't really mean that...
I'm just a bunch of stolen parts?!
But... who am I?
You'd love me, even without these other princess's parts?
