Who is the one that bears the thimble?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, you foolish boy. Without full body armor, you're weak! You do not look  Click-click! Ha ha ha ha. Yah!
Good luck exposing your soft, vanilla-strawberry skin to the elements, dork! Haaaaaaa! Later, losers!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
What's the matter, crimson cheeks? Feeling a little embarrassed in the swamp of embarrassment?  You're so red, you look like a tomato. Ha ha ha ha!

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Look at you losers. Finn, you don't have any armor, and your friend is dressed like a lady! Ha ha ha! So not Click-click!

Oh!
