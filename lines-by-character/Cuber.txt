Oh, hello.  Here for more graybles, I presume. Well you've come to the right computer-fable. Feast your eyes-mabel, on my holo-pyramid viewer and  Huh? What's that? Not in the mood for graybles, you say? Oh dear. You okay? Did something fatlabel happen to you?  Oh, I see. You'd rather watch me buh-blabel a bird-house in my workshop.  Hm. More of a grayble man by trade. But okay! Come on!
Oh, hello again! As you can see, the bird-house is nearly complete! All that's left is where the door hole goes. But I can't remember.  Hm. Door hole. Wait! I just remembered! My door hole solution lies in one of tonight's scheduled graybles! Would you mind I look through them to find it?  OK!  Yeey! Here we go!
Ha-ha! There it is! You see? The birdhouse doorit's right above the peg thingy. Why didn't I think of that?  Well, I guess that's it for this week. I'll see you crimpy glimmers on thewhat? What's that? You want to finish the grayble?  You want to see if you can still guess the theme?  You just want to see how it ends.  Well, let's get right to it, then. Ha-ha.Hmm? Oh! Hello there! Bayble navel! Its great to see you! Here for more graybles, I reckon. Well, alright. Just like last time.  Well watch five separate stories, each relating to one special theme.  Guess the theme by the end of the episode and youll be the freshest mint-whistle!  Now, look to my visualizer screen and let this exciting grayble dribble all over your mind-label!
So, did you guess the theme? Go ahead and pause your viewer now if you need a few more glayble to think about it a little.  Oho! Now youve got it! I can tell! Thats right, the theme is the five tastes.  You see, Jake ate a SWEET plum. Marceline played some SAVORY licks. Tree Trunks had a SOUR taste inside her mouth. Oh my. Gunter wanted to drink the SALTY tears. And Football's tea was BITTER.  Huh? Whats that you say? You thought the theme was the five fingers?  Dont be silly! No ones had five fingers for twenty blablillion glaybles. Five telepathy glands maybe.  Ah... slimmin. Well anyway, looks like its that time again.  Ill see you crimpy glimmers on triode flimpin the diode!Hmm?  Oh, greeble bayble grapes. You're just in time. Bayble Cuber's going to watch an inkle dribble adventure from days of old on my holo-pyramid viewer. Five stories each relating to one special theme. See if you graybles can guess the theme by the end of the episode, okay? Now sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.
Oh, bayble, that was easy, wasn't it? Slimmin'? I'm glad we all guessed the theme so easily. What? You haven't guessed it? Oh. I'm sorry. Well, pause your viewer now to think about it before I belayble it to you.  The theme was the five senses! You see? Look. BMO saw his reflection. Finn and Jake touched their hands together! The Princess made a tasty sandwich! The blue guy smelled bad! And the other thing heard music. Oh, what a treat! Okay, well I'll see you trimpy flimmers on triode flimpin' the diode!
