Simon, don't leave me like this.
Simon? What is going on?
You're dumping me?
But where would I go without you?
I don't understand. You don't seem crazy now. I mean, in the future.
Simon, I know who I'm leaving you for!
You, dum-dum!
Simon?  What's wrong? Are you sick?
Don't die, Simon. I just got here.
I know! I'll fix the crown, and then I'll figure out how to fix you!
Right, whoever you are.  I'm sorry. It's the only way.
Okay, rug, take me to Bella Noche.
Get on, Simon!
Not forever. Destroying Bella Noche and getting your power back will buy me time to find a loophole that'll undo your curse and your death. I can do it! You got to believe me, Simon.
What?
We're here to help!
Simon!
Hey, don't scare me like that.
Don't be a wimp, Simon! Just give me a second!
Surprise!  Tranch.
