Ha-ha-ha. Okay, now make him look angrier!
Nope, not funny anymore. Sorry, dudeyou ruined it.
Yo Finn, did you order a brick?
False alarm; it's just an email.
Looks like Ice King's handwriting.
Alright, alright, hold on.  Oh man! Thing must've had a computer worm in it!
Open video and...
Potato trampoline...
Then crashment!
47 grapes!
Okay, shh, you're safe!
Aw, man. Okay, here is my dream plan. You were wearin' tights made of green feathers. These tiny green feathers. And I was this wisecracking coelacanth that only ate popcorn. Anyway, we were in this
Hold on, I'm almost done. So we were trapped inside this huge egg, and after a while you started dancing in this kind of sign language. And then Ice King's glitchy stuff started eatin' my dream up. I peed in my pants, but you went up and talked to it. You just... talked to it.
Yeah, tell us your feelings! Get deep.
Sllabfoog uoy pleh tnac I...
Slaw frog yokel snacky. Snacky slaw frog yokel. Sea salt yack let a snacky. Yeah, that sounds good!
No, wait, dude. I think I cracked the code!
AAAAAAH!!!
This must be the universal source code!
Huh?
Okay, enough exploring already. Where is this glitch guy? I'm gonna smash his jimmies.
Oh, no, my arm!  We had so many great times together...
Dooby, dooby, dooby, dooby, skeebily, skeebily, dapdy doo...
Huh? Who's that?  Awww.
Let's do this... for Righty!
So, hey, Finn, how do you plan on taking this guy out?
Okay, I guess it's worth trying.
Aah! What we do now?
Hey, Finn! Remember that gross video Ice King sent?
Let's double team these locks!
You should wash your hair!
Everything back to normal, huh?
Yeah, no big deal. Geez...
Yeah. Where is he? I wanna kick his boingloings, too!Sorry CB, we'll finish this up later.
Hey, Lemongrabs! You home?
Kiss it!
Hey! Weirdos!  Get the birthday cake!
What the thing is up with this guy?
What?
Where should we go?
I wonder who put them in there.
Oh, cool!
Yeah, thanks, man!
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
Yech.
Um, maybe we should hands... for safety.
So, where'd you want to look ne-- Eeeh!  Uh, Finn?!
Nope!
I think this is it.
Maybe the kidnapper's in there, too, coercing them.
Ah, stop, man! You're just makin' it worse!  Let's just get this over with.
Fix the door? What?! What? Fix the door? Fix--what? What's goin' on here? Fix the door. Finn, what's goin' on? Fix the door.
You know there's guys starvin' up there?!
You can grow new food now.
You really are gonna die.
Yeah, but look!  He's heading right for the Candy Kingdom!
Giant poison candy aspirin!  I've got this one, but it might be too small.
Yeah, but we'll never find it again in time... unless that's it there  with the juice coming out. Remember all that juice, from before?
Tastes like vitamins.
Are you sure this is it? It's not even doing anything.
Right.
But how come we don't just fix their hearts like we did with Lemonjon so they're more selfless and less selfish?I dont know. Im the first come first serve kinda guy. Get in line, ladies! This Rainicorn thing cant last forever!   I didnt mean that. Dont spread that around.
Well, no. I mean, if you feel something, you feel something!  Its not about personality matrixals and charts, its all about the bu-bumps in your heart!  You cant stop the pumps and bumps! Pumps and bumps! Pumps and bumps!
What about them?
Whoa! Wait! Did BMO say something to you?
Oh, I see. Youre being weird.
BMO and Ice King?
Youre creepin me out.
Oh, is that what youre doing?
Im not!
How could you know that?
You can?
Hey, whats that in your pants?
Crazy.  Careful, dude.
What the heck?! Are they alive?!
Maybe its black magic. Maybe we shouldnt mess with them.
Yeah, thats good. How many more thingies are in there?
Ill make a special spagot  with a new sauce.
Whos in the C-list?
Thats not very nice.
Involved with what?
What are they talkin about?
Whoa! What kinda narrative are you trying to create here?!
Alright, well, what else ya got goin on?
Ice King? Hes not C-list?
No. Dont play with that hack. Aww, man. Hmm.  Theyve got good chemistry. Whod have guessed?
Hey, Finn, eat the food before it gets cold.  I made a new sauce! Umm, earth to Finn, are you okay?
Youre up early.
You stay up all night readin trash books?  I told you, man. Those datin books.  That stuff is mess you up.
Oh, let me see little me.  Me look so lonely. Hey, Finn, pass me little Lady.
Wha?
Who?!
Ahhhhhh!  What the ball, man?!
What? What do ya think what?!
I dont like where youre going with this. It aint wholesome. Im gonna go to Ladys for a few days. To clear my head.
Im back! I got over all that messed up stuff you did.  Yeesh. You okay, man?
Whats little Finn doing?
He looks sad. Whats he thinking about?
Wheres little Rainicorn?
Wha?
Aww.
This is messed up, dude. Youve crossed the line from weird curiosity to some dark messed up stuff.
The destruction!  The depravity!  The wrongness of it all! Im taking that bag back to the cliff where we found it.
You cant! Just let them do their own biz, man!
How would ya do that?
But he cant hear you.
Hmm. Maybe were on different dimensional planes and the border between our planes is like a two way mirror. So we can see him, but he cant see us.
Try shakin him.
Maybe were vibrating on different intervals. Try shakin him at different speeds and see if he responds.
Now go faster!
Faster!
Go slower, he saw you!
Whoa! Neat!
Now what?
Is that gonna do it?  Get the C-listers out.  Good party. Oh, flip!  Look whos hittin it off with the Ice King!Meditating.
Wait, dude. I'm connecting to the internet with my mind.
Check it outI downloaded a little dance.
Look! It's Princess Bubblegum's rainicorn! She looked like she was crying.
Yeah! Yeah, let's do it!
Rrrrroar!
She's flying into the Ice Kingdom.
Seriously... but what are we gonna do?
What's up?
That guy is a total patoot.
Whoa! And there's Princess Bubblegum!
Yes, please.  Howop!  Let's do it!
That was totally math!
Oh, my goodness!
I'm 28!
Hey, how's it goin'? My name's Jake.
Are you kidding? I play the viola too.
You are crazy. You are so crazy.
Let's go!
Hey, sloppy milkshake!
Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
Whoa, what is going on?
Go where, dude? We don't have anything to do.
I don't see any adventures going on anywhere. I think we're good to just sit here for a while and just talk about our feelings.
What time is it?Hey, Jake Jr.  You having fun at daddy's?
OK. You seem kind of dump trucks.
You know, in the dumps.
Sounds like my little baby girl wanna build a time machine!
No, no, no. Leave it up to your daddy and uncle Finn!  Yup.
Ding-ding!  Scre-e-e-ech!
You just gotta sign for it, to prove you accepted delivery.
Yeah, just give it a little jerk.
Hey, sweetie! Sweetie, look! Your time machine's all ready!
Aw, anything for my baby pup.
Time machine!No way, man.
Well, now you know we can't jump off of birds.  I paid them up front. They don't leave until the job's done. Besides...  They're funny.   Look, she just farted.
I don't know... but I'm feeling better already. Ah. That tickles.
No, keep going.
Oh, yeah. Huh?
Ah, no thanks. I think the kisses work better.  Excuse me, don't stop, keep going, please.
Hey! We all have our own ways.Finn, lunch is ready!
It's good! I learned it from Rainicorn.
Dude, this took me, like
Whoa!  Eh.
Apples?
All of what?
No ghost doodies. Oh. Oh, wait.  Oh, no. No.
Hey, guys, I found something! Look!
Oh, the Candy Tavern, man. I used to hang out there back when I used to snatch old ladies' purses.
Don't worry, I stopped doing that a long time ago. I didn't know it was wrong.
Be cool, man. You're gonna queer the deal.
Hold on, we gotta go potty.
What just happened?
Hey, Finn.
What's that on your face, buddy?
Y'know, I think I seen that symbol somewhere before. Yeah, right next door to where I used to hawk stolen bikes.
I didn't know it was wrong.
Yeah, you see? That guy must work here or somethin'.
Here.
Uh, yeah, why?
Wait, you mean apples as diamonds?
Apples as apples?
And that's why there weren't any footprints around the tree!
As innocent as a baby's butt cheek!Are you up to it, TT?Well, that's normal; people always have weird thoughts around campfires.
What?! Nah.
What's wrong with tummy rubs?
Alright buddy,  that's a little too much campfire. Time for bed, .
What is it, boyi?!
Let's do it!Naw, man, I'm in the kitchen making us breakfast.
Alright, hang on out there I'm comin'
Hey, a bubble! Pop!
Oh, it's just BMO, he's pretending to be all messed up because his bubble got popped.What?
No, man, I told you,
I don't do that kinda stuff anymore.
I don't know...
Maybe.
No!
Oh, Finn lost his sock! Everybody stop what you're doing and help Finn find his precious sock!
Hey, has anyone seen BMO?  BMO? Where's BMO?
BMO!
Ya see, man? That was really fun. You don't need two socks to have fun.
Our chicken's name is Lorraine?Eh... It's not really time travel, though. You just, you know, moved their stuff around. You didn't really manipulate time. Ice King's done it better before... with magic.
Eh, I guess, but not really.
I mean, Ice King did it for real. Guy pulled his fiancee out of time from a thousand years ago using magic.BMO?
What did you do?
Hey, hey. Don't worry buddy. We're Finn and Jake, remember? Or should I say...  Finn and JMO!
Hello, there.
Hey there, DMO. I am JMO.
But nothing's moving down there. It's all shut down. What happened to this place?
Uh, what question?
I'm serious...
Hurry, Finn. I think he's calling the police or somethin'!
Ah, we gotta hustle!
Dang, man, how deep does this place go?
Cram your tram!  Womp!
Finn, how are we getting to BMO's driver port?!
My bod!
Wait, what's up?
Dude, how old are you?!
Hey, you're not gonna reset our friend's personality, are you?
Wait, did you say you built a million robots?Hey, what kind of coffee do you want?
That's terrible.
Nooooo! Stop!
Yeah.
Excuse us for a moment, Strong.  Dude, you know you're my bro, but that girl is bad news.
She's crazy, man. She's a fish person!
Dude, she tried to eat Peppermint Butler! She'd probably be worse if she was so scared of everything.
Oh, I'm coming with you if only to be disruptive and obnoxious!
Fish people.
Fish People! I'll be, um, a dolphin!
Grrr... What? Hey, hey. What?
Oooh... I'm on a boat with a couple of wackos. Shakin' my hips, and dippin' my fat toe... In the water! Dippin' in the water! This party's gettin' hotter! It's so hot... it's stupid. So where we headed, Susan?
Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no, no! No, Susan, no!
Dude, she's crazy.
Whatever, man. This is a crazy cruise, and Susan is our crazy captain... and I'm a crazy clam-shell! Woo-ep!  Oh, doing the clam!
Hey, you hearing that too?
Huh?
Uh-huh. Finn, let's get outta here.
You know, I could just stretch us over this thing.
She's flippin' crazy! Come on, Finn. Let's bail.
That looks like... my father. ...Now I'm crazy!
Oh, thank Glob.
What's making all that swishing?
It's just more pool floaties!
Susan! Susan, Lub glubs are just pool toys!  Watch, I'm putting an end to all this craziness, with my Pickaxe Hand!  No more craziness.
Ooooh... Jakey beefed it!
Bad news, dude. There's only two of us and more than, um,  this many of them!
Yes! I'm okay with that! I'll do whatever Susan says!
I gots it!
Finn, win aide to fair Susan! Jake brings the fire!
Almost... there...  Oh, so I just toss it in here? Pretty straightforward. Okay, well, here I go.  one, two, three...   That reminds me of... my mother.
Whoa. It is beautiful.
C'mon, Finn, let's go! I grabbed, like, 100 soft pretzels!I-I don't know. I think I'm still asleep
Then we're sharin' the same dream, dude.  Look out your window!
Whoaaaaa!
Hey, man, I don't think this is a dream.
Ughhhh, monster guts.
Bleh.
Eeeeeeee!
Ohhhhh. It's gross!
Well... we should go.
They're partying! They're fine.
Well, it goes into your stomach...
...and then it stays there for a bit, and then it turns into They're all gonna turn into... the stuff!
What's goin' on?
Bye!
You're the chief.
Dude, we've been partyin' for hours.
Full-blown.
It's kinda peaceful.
Shh. Seriously? The only foreseeable threat might be all these trees being swallowed, but they're not hurtin' nothin'.
Oh, okay.
Ehhhhh.
You're sick, Party Pat. I'm gonna go watch TV.Move the bass down.
Be reasonable.
Believe! She's like a million years old!
And still looking good!
Cool.
Uh...
It kind of sounds like a good idea.Man... let's go home.
But, Finn, I'm gettin' all cranky around my joke-hole.
Oof!
Whuzzat?
Dude, no!! Don't touch that thing! It's probably got some kind of sacred significance.
Finn?!  Oh, my Jah! Finn's become one with the lamb!!
We'll get through this, my bro. I swear, I'm gonna get you out of that lamb.
Ow. Ow.  Ow.
Wish I knew how to free you, bro.
BMO, stop fake-farting.
Hmm...  That's it! We'll do all Finn's favorite stuff 'til he comes out! BMO! Play Finn's favorite song!
Are you hearing this, buddy?
Alright, Finn. This oughta free you from your body prison. Couple-a' rounds of Kompy's Kastle will jog your psychic schnaps. That's what I think. Co-op mode like we always do! Oh, yeah! C'mon, Finn, drop the drawbridge. Kompy's blood lust meter's goin' down. Lemme help ya there.  Whuzza!! You love Kompy!
NO!!  Finn's trapped in here!!
You donk! I will smash you!! WAAAH!!
Whoooo?!
Whoa! Finn, is that you?!
Finn! Finn! Finn!  Whooooaaaa...  That was beautiful!
Let's go flush this in the sacred bathroom!Boo! That was pre-written. It's so obvious! Take him out, Finn!
Awesome.
What's going on here? Who's that?
His special Lady?
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Well, I hope you guys get back together. Whoo-oop!There for you, bro... but Finn, I'm gonna tell you something gently.
Get a new sword.
Bro, these guys could've hurt you.
Bro...
It'll be okay. Let's go shopping!
Hey! There's Choose Goose!  Goose! Come on!  Finn? What's wrong?
What? But we have history with himthat's important in business.
Ooh. Yeah, okay.
I asked around. This is the place to get sa-words.
Well, that was easy.
Hey, the pillow vendor!
Huh? Pizza?!
You're getting good with that sword. You were never able to do that with your other swords.
Pie!
He's gettin' really good. He saved me from pizza.
I like it when Tree Trunks gets all serious.
Uh, how's that curse doin'? Makin' you want to moidle me?
Well, okay.  Dang tag.
Hmm?
Hey, quit showin' off, bro!
Good idea.
What's goin' on?
Huh?
Oh, snap!
Don't worry. I'll handle this.  There.
Huh. Hey, he's not here.
It's the Hooligans Who Love Candles!
Dude...
Don't give up, man. Hey, maybe Choose Goose knows where the old man went.
Hey, Choogles! We need your help. We gotta find the dude who sold us this cursed sword. You know who he is?
What? Come on, Choogie, it was only one time.
Awesome. Wizard of Grassy Moun-tayn... Mountain. Yeah, thanks, Choogs.
Now that you've accepted it, you can control it!
Do it again!Oooooooh!
Get him out!
Did he get you with his poison stingers?
Let me see. Wow, that's a tiny splinter.
Oh.
This dude.
Say what?
Yeah, man, you're gonna do it!
Yeah, what a bumbleberry!
What's the poem say?
Hmm... It means that we have to cross that swamp.
You don't just read the poetry to understand it. You got to  feel it. Trust me, dude-- I'm smarter than everyone. Now get in there!
No way, man. This armor thing is your deal!  I'll wait for you on the other side.
You okay, man?
Hmm... Ooh! The meadow weeps as morning sings of milk and honey and things to come.
It means we have to silence the echoing in the woods.
All right, I'll handle this one, dude.
Then just make her think it's her idea. That's how you make the ladies do what you want.
Ha ha ha! She thinks you're her red-faced baby or something. I think she wants ya to nurse, dude!
Huh?
Yeah! Just you wait, weirdo!  Uh, Finn? Uh-oh.
Yeah!
How? He's already dead.
Finn, its so beautiful!
Click-click!
Put on the armor! It'll protect you from evil, even ghosts!
Hey!
Uhh... Yeah!  Listen when your mother is speaking to you!
You should be ashamed of yourself -- a boy your age sitting in this cave alone for thousands of years. You need to go outside and get some sunlight!
No back talk! Outside! Now!
No problem, dude. I couldn't have done it without  the power of embarrassment!
Good one, Finn.
Whatever!
Come on, dude, let's get out of here.
Wa-hoo!  Dude, this armor is totally Click-click!Nachos?
Naaaaa... chos.
Yeah, whatever.
Yeah that's great, get it out of here!
Move your face, you're messing up the game. Anyway, I don't wanna talk about it, it's personal. Cats know what they did...
Eugh... no! I'm pretty dang far from okay! There's a little shard of Tortilla chip caught between my teeth.
You think I can stretch out of everything? You're so naive. To live life, you need problems.
If you get everything you want the minute you want it, then what's the point of livin'?
You forgot the most important part, my impatient little friend. A thorough rinsing!
Bleh, nothing.  I need, like, a toothpick, or something.
Floss is for losers.
Oh, one of these will do nicely.
Just the edge, kid, then I'll work it like a pro. Now, to find the card that best suits my devil-may-care personality.
Hey, BMO! Ta-da!
Oh, I didn't. It's still there.  It'll be like a constant reminder of what life's all about.
ZIP IT!Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
Eh, I'm trying something new. Hey, how's it going, miss...?
Whoa. You're a dead ringer for Flame Princess, with a smidge of Princess Bubblegum mixed in.  Guess you're still hung up on both of 'em, bro.Naah,  don't let me interrupt you. You two have fun.
Finn!
Now do the thing I like.
Hehehe, classic.  Alright Finn, that's enough.
Woah! Hold on mama.
Okay bro, tin foil's on. You can hug now.
Looks like your date went pretty good buddy.
Bro, you gotta let things take their natural path. Look, look , let me explain some junk about dating. Right now, , you're at Tier 1, which is hugging. But pretty soon,  you'll be at Tier 2, which is smooching. Then down the road , you'll make it to Tier 5, where she'll let you discover all fifteen feet of her loong, beautiful stomach. Then after awhile, you'll make it to Tier 8 , where you touch her horn for the very first time. Very special.
You stay away from that! Do not do Tier 15!
Don't worry about it dude, just let things naturally move to Tier 2. Oh and um, you need a shower dude.
Probably.
What are you doing here?
Oh.
Aah, he's just smelly from a day of running around with his lady-friend.
Uh, I shouldn't say. It's his business.
That's his personal biz, you gotta respect the man's p-biz.
Flame Princess! He's hanging out with Flame Princess!
And I don't mean to be telling stories out of school. But pretty soon,  they're gonna be taking it to Tier 2.
Oh, it's possible.
Mmm, weird.
President Porpoise!
Ok Princess, you need to stop breaking in here.
Uh, ok,  Tier 2 baby!
What? Where am I?
Oh my glosh!
He stepped out.
Oh, oh!  I see what's going on here!
Oh man, PB is totally jealous of Flame Princess!
What's up man?
She doesn't want you see Flame Princess anymore. She's crazy jealous!
So, you at Tier 2 yet?
Nnoope.
I know exactly what'll get you Tier 2.... A sappy poem.
Say something about her spectrum.
Back off, Bubblegum! That's his man's biz.
You heartless monster! Do you have any idea how much he's CRIED OVER YOU? Finn deserves to be happy, even if his blooping face gets burned off!  You should be  ashamed!  You're SICK!
Finn!
Are you alright?
It's hot!
Geh.. What about Finn?
Jeeeaalous?I keep finding baby shoes!
WHAT THE HECK, MAN?! And they're all lefties! Sorry I'm not finding any loot.
Aww. Building this gauntlet dock is hard, man. Hard work sucks.
Incoming iceberg!
I got dibs! Ooo. I hope it's not baby shoes.
It's a guy.
You know what they remind me of? Well-dressed pickles.
Whoa, don't roast 'em, man. You gotta flambe.
Ah. Perfecto. Bon appetit.
I don't think they made it.
What kind of business do you do?
Yes! Help us fix that dock.
Yeah! Right over there.
But they're begging for it, Finn. Just look at 'em.
Finn. These poor souls are lost without jobs. We can't ignore their plight.
Go on guys, fix it up!
Of course, man. They said they love work for you.
Told ya so.
Yeah! Woo!  See? If we hire them full time, they'll be back in business and we'll be able to focus on fun stuff. Everybody wins!
You hear that, guys? Maybe I'm right!
Yeah, mans!
Relax, man. This is your day off.
Uh huh.
Cool!
Me too. These cubes are... frickin' resilient. Hey, business dudes! Hold off these cubes so we can catch our breath?
These guys are great, right?
That's 'cause you had time to rest your body and refresh your brain.
Yeah! Good work.
Got 'em!
Oh... Lost again!
What's that?
Oh, wow. Anything going on?
Freakin' awesome, man.
Takin' care of business.
Yeah!
Holy moly!
Woo! Yes!
Yeah.  You're gut's so huge and moldable.
Hold on a sec!
I'm the Ice King, and I'll never find a bride because I'm such a tool.
That's a- Hey, what'd you say?
Man, I am not in the mood for saving Lumpy Space Princess.
Right. We'll just save our strength for the big adventures, then.
Ahh. Nice call, dude.
I'm too tired to imagine stuff, but I bet you're right.
Yeah. Let the businessmen handle it.
businessmen, dude.
Man, just let the businessmen handle it.
Huh?
Finn? Whoa... Crud.
I'm comin' buddy!
Ahh. I'm so fat, dude; I don't know what to do.
What? Why?
Ok, Alright.  Hey! You guys are horrible at business!
Huh? They're sucking me up, dude!
Ok!
This sucks.
Oh no!
So, wait... What'd you hire them to do?
I'm gonna miss 'em. And I'm gonna miss this gut.Hey! I was trying to read that!
What business are you into?
Talk about it over lunch?
Hey!
We must.
Stolen. But all we have to go on is part of a name. Pete something.  Need more clues! Hold me!
Oop, sorry.  Aah!
Ooh, turn it around!
Got some bags and...wait-  more bags. But no leads on Pete something.
Hmm.
Yeah man, that's definitely blood.
Let's roll.
Hello, citizen. Had anyone in here looking to buy some mini adhesive bandages today?
See anyone who might be our guy?
I really like turnin' into cop stuff. I literally can't stop turning into cop stuff.  Hey, there's Platform 5!  I see a nasty tranch!
We're not criminals, man! We're working the beat, just like you!
Not yet we didn't!
If we cut through the forest, maybe we can head it off at the pass.
Give back what you stole from LSP!
Ehh, I got this.  You have the right to remain... busted.
Save it for the candy judge, Pete.
You do the crime, you do the time, man!
Burgle our friend, it's the end.  For you!
Let's ball.
We are awesome at being cops!  No question about that.
I know, man. I actually totally do know exactly what you mean.
I told you: I have a problem. I can't stop!
Yeah, good work, BMO!
Tomato sauce?
But how would pizza sauce end up in a hotel room?
Or maybe he's out tying up loose ends!
Danger!
Shh!
Huh, huh? Come on pal. Turns out the only case here is just another case of LSP being nutty!No. It's nothin'.
Ha ha. You're a charmer, Finn Human. No... it's... well... Lady Rainicorn doesn't wanna play the game Card Wars with me. I always beat 'er... so she says, No more Card Warring.
It's a fantasy card game that's super complicated and awesome, butwell... No, it's kinda stupid. Never mind.
Really? Well... I thought you'd say it was for nerds who do not know how life is outside of the nerd universe.
Thanks, Finn.
Oh, hey, BMO. You wanna play, too?
Ah, whatever. Let's play the game.
How about... the loser... is a dweeb, and the winner is a cool guy?
Coffee ground, beetle butter, grape jelly, kimchi, and... this stuff.
We drink when the game is over.
Now lemme explain the rules.
That's basically the basics! So once we have our kingdom set up...  ...it's time to start to play. FOR THE GLORY!  Hey, were you asleep?! I'll have to explain it all over again!
But if you don't know the rules then you're gonna lose in the first couple rounds, like Lady always does! And then you'll hate the game, and then you'll hate me, and then, and then...
Haha! Bring it!
Oh... you, uh, floop your land cards.
Keep those honeys hidden, or I'll get a strategic advantage!
Okay, I go first. I floop the Silo of Truth!
Pfff, you got really lame cards. Hmm. I'll take the Cerebral Bloodstorm, though.
Okay, now it's the battle phase. I'm attackin' your schoolhouse with my Husker Knights.  And I'm castin' Cerebral Bloodstorm!  So, what'll you use to defend?
Of course not!
What?!
Okay... okay, first of all, you don't floop a creature to make it fight. You activate a creature.
No... He's eating all my cornfields! My Husker Knights draw energy from corn!
You just wiped out my entire attack!!
CORNFIELDS ARE AWESOME! What makes you think you know so much about Card Wars?!
...Your turn.
You're supposed to discard a card and pick up a new one first.
Look at you. You're a babe in the woods. Your beginner's luck ends this round!
Spirit Tower?! And the Cave of Solitude?!
That's it? You're not attacking?
HA! Then the seas have aligned and the five winds waft the smell of victory to my palace doors! I cast Field of Nightmares and activate my Legion of Earlings to scare your Pig to death!
Um... I cast Teleportto move your Pig to the empty field so I can attack 'im!
You're right. I'm gonna slay that Pig, though!
Hmm.  You're the cool guy, huh? Well, lemme make it a little hot for you, then.  Heh heh heh heh... I floop the Volcano!
Hmm. Maybe.
The Pig is dead. Now I reconstitute my cornfields using the Reclaim Landscape spell!  My Husker Knights revive! And I still have my battle phase! Hiding in the Useless Swamp... the Immortal Maize Walker!
Cornfields give the Immortal Maize Walker triple damage.
I told you cornfields are awesome! Your Ancient Scholar and Cool Dog won't survive this time!
So what?
NOOOOO!
YOU GANKED MY SPIRIT WALKER!! AAAAGH!
Your turn.
YOU PLAY! YOU PLAY!
Play. The. Game.
Well... I've still got my Wandering Bald Man.  Oh, no.
Well, that's stupid. Just attack with the Immortal Maize Walker and get the game over with.
I...
OHHH-HO! Ohhh, oh, yeah! Pigs can't leave mud landscapes once they're on them! Hahaha! The Pig is mine! First, I'll play Reclaim Landscape, then I cast Summon Archer Dan!
You have no creatures left. That's the game, boyee!! The five winds blow through cornfields once again! For the glory of Jakoria!
In yo' face! It's time to drink up! It looks like you are the dweeb and I'm the cool guy!   Is it... too gross for you, man?
WHAT?!
AW, IT'S GROSS!You're totally slow dude, speed up them gams.
Ready to admit it's harder than it looks?
Heh heh heh.
Actually you did pretty good! Hey check it out!
Looks like a giant dead turtle.
Yeah, get your glasses on grandma, this kid is pure. In fact he's about to help that little crying kid.
We want to turn your frown all the way around.
I'll face the other way, but I'm gonna keep doing this.
Oh boy.
Yeah! We're gonna purify that city!
Crud.
And then I'm gonna beat your purity outta them.  And then beat a sandwich into them!  And then beat them to the punch! And then punch 'em!
Okay.
You're going down, turtle!
Woah! I want jets!
Hey! We can steal a new one from that guy!  He's got lots of flower baskets. And boots! I'd like to steal me one of them pairs of boots, especially.
Okay.
Just gotta steal these boots...
Huh?
It's the city, it's getting to me. Help me, Finn!
Thank you Finn, thank you.
Oh. Hmm.
Comin'!
Huh, what? What boots?  Oh, no! I stole! The city! It took advantage of me!
Yes, I can.  Oh.
She already did, man.
You see, if you have too much earwax, you won't be able to hear anymore.
Woah, woah, woah. Easy, kid.
Hey, that's enough from you, Hag!   Finn?
Come on, Finn, keep it together!
I'm not gonna leave you alone in the city. You're my buddy. Besides, I stole these boots. These super-big style boots. So I'm just as dirty as you are, Finn. We gotta walk this filthy path together!
Cowabunga!
Hi, Penny.
Watch out, Finn!
Yeah, dude.
Nice work, dude.
Woah, dude!  The soap got on us, too!
Woah, dude. Why are you naked?Everything burrito!   I love you, everything burrito.  Oh, man. I think someone wants to eat everything burrito! I won't let 'em get ya, baby!
Ready!
So cute!
Haha!
I can't! I'm paralyzed by the cuteness!
Huh?
My burrito!
No, Finn... They probably poisoned it!
They knew my name. They knew about the burrito.
Oh, nothing much. You know, just... chillin'.
A little.
Yeah. Thanks, buddy.  Man, you sound just like Mom sometimes.
She always knew just what to say.
Goodnight.  Finn! Finn!  Finn, wake up, man!
I think someone's in the house.  For real, man! Shh, listen.
I swear, man! I really heard something.  Finn!!
What the?! That's my sword!  What do they want with my sword, man?!   It came from downstairs.
Where are you going?
...What?!
Oh, no. OH, AWWW, NO!
Awww, no! It's a dead goat, man! Its guts are all over the place! It's all chopped up and spread around and...  Ah, no, wait, it's just a blanket. I think I left it here this morning.
Aaah! Aaah!
Shake 'im!
Shake 'im around 'til he stops!
Okay. Now tell 'im not to talk about our mom!
Hold 'im!
Well?! Do you believe me now, Finn?!
Well, that's close enough. Let's start settin' up some barricades!
There's gotta be a thousand of 'em!
These guys aren't a threat to anyone.
Wanna just smash 'em all?
What?! And mess up my stats?!
Alright.
Who're we gonna call?
Ketchup is delicious and deceiving!
I'm dead.
BAAAHAHAHAHAHA! Ah, I'm sorry, everybody! Ah, I couldn't keep it in! Hahahaha!
Tastes better than blood. Or does it? Hey, Finn, you think blood tastes better than ketchup?
Aw, nuts.
We wanna apologize for being fakers.Yo, man, what's going on?
Oo, that's cool, but do you know what's really cool? Tough Guy contest!  Whoo-hoo!  Tough Boys!
That's impossible, Tree Trunks exploded in the scary dark forest after she ate that Crystal Gem Apple, remember?
Come on man! Tough Guy contest me!
you got what it takes to rip-it?!
Then let's get it on!
Hee-yah!
Do it, Finn, do it!
I'm gonna break out!
I'm breaking out of my fat!  I win, Finn! Finn?  Finn, Finn! Are you okay?!
I was just messing with ya, dude.
Are you okay?
Oh dangit, Jake  you can't get all out of control like that!  Why am I like this?!  like this... like this...
We were just playin' and then I got out of control! I'm sorry, dad.
But I don't want to hurt nobody!
Noooo!
Whatevs', daddy!   I'm never going to hurt anybody, ever, starting... now!
Finn, you're okay! I was afraid I mashed your potatoes too hard last night.
Nope, no more, dude.
I never wanna lose control again, man! I'm going totally soft
Mmm hmm.
Whoa...
Hey, you guys, put my bro down.
Finn!
Hey, man, what happened?
Okay, I'll try to do it using 'controlled conversation'
Hey, man, I'm Jake.
I wanna know why you took my buddy and I'm not going to use force to get it out of you.
Whose orders?
Ah, man!
Can't we work this out like gents?
No, dad, I gotta control myself!  Control, control, control, con-trol.
Whoa, okay okay. I'm hatching a controlled plan. Alright, man, move out of the way and let me get my friend.
Then I'll have to move you myself,  with my mind.
Finn!  Don't hurt my buddy!  No, Jake, no, don't lose control.
No, no punchies! I am in control!
Nobody, man, don't look at me!
Stupid-ghost-dad! I'll show him!  Okay, intimidate them with controlled attack.
open up! Feel my controlled attack! Whoooomp psssh  Whoooomp psssh, Oooo oooh psssh.
I'm not hurting you am I?
Well, there's a lot more where that came from! So you best tell me why you're turning Finn into a crystal.
So, help me I will touch you!
Finn, oh no!
Nooo! My bud!!
I'm sorry, Finn, I'm super lame and now...you're dead.
Oh.
That voice.
I'll try man, but I'm still figuring out my bizz,  here I come, Tree Trunks!  Taste my gentle rubs!
She's too sassy and powerful!
Jermaine?! Are you dead?
Oh, I'm sorry about that time I beat you up.
But dad, you said I was going to hurt everybody!
I don't know, dad, that doesn't really help me.
Oh, well then I'm over it then! Rarr
That must be giving her all her powers!
TT, you're back.
Oh shush, Tree Trunks, if I had a penny for every time someone went crazy hopped up on magic energy... I'd be Abraham Lincoln!Alright. Whaddaya wanna see next?
Alright, I'll try to turn into a cheetah farting.  I can't do the spots.
Did you squish the sparkles?
Oh, snap!  Well, plop that cartridge in the slot, playah!
What?!
Dude, take your hands off your head.
Whoa, dang!
Whoa!!
Uh...
Whoa! Burgers and hotdogs! Yeah, yeah, YEAH!
But... burgers and hotdogs..
Yeah, so?
Mm-hmm, I remember.
Aaaahh...
But Dad, Finn's already figured that out. He's a good kid with a kind heart.
Okay!
But
Finn!
Ugh... Let's take the flower path!
Because... you're super gross, man.
Um... He said he's surprised a whiny baby like you made it this far.
Mm...
Because... you cry like a baby... Baby!
Whoa.
Waaaah, I cry when people die. Waaah, I'm Finn.
Dude, don't eat that!!
Time to go, baby.  Finn, come on!
Rrrr... Yah!
There's another cartridge.  Alright, man, Dad told me not to tell you this, but
You're not real.  Dad asked me to call you Baby because he wants you to be tough.
On this next holo-message we listen to, when Dad tells you to cover your ears, don't.
Finn!  Dude! Use your karate biz!
Dude... Dad loves you!
You know I don't think you're a baby, right?
That sword is sweet!
Yeah.Yo BMO, you done chargin' up that phone or what?
Thanks, BMO. Alright, man. We're gonna figure this out... right... now!
Yo yo yo yo, check it! This is Jake on my camera phone!  Whooooooooooaaaaaaa. Whoooa! Yo, Finn! Say 'hi' to my new camera phone!
Whoo! Yeah, baby!
Alright. So, this is the Nightosphere, I guess.  It looks banay-nays.  Marceline says they got tons of crazy ways out here.  Right, Marceline?  Marceline!  Marcy!!  Hehehe.
Heheheh, nice one.
What offer, Marceline's dad?
Ow, my hippocampus!
Well... that explains how we got amnesia-ed.  But what about banana?
Whoa, dude!  She told us never to come back!
Mhmm.
What's your disguise?
Nice!
It's us! Finn and Jake!
These guys won't help you. They're all complacent sheeple.
Okay...
Aw, sick!
Ahhhh! I'm too freaked out to move, Finn! These demons are nibbling my legs!
No, Finn! You'll be filled with chaotic evil!
Dude... seriously.Whoa!
Don't let the dragon, drag on, man.
We should get out of here, Finn. I think someone called the heat.
Whoa! Intruder! Finn! There's an intruder in here!
Ohhhhhh.
Do you think that'll goin' to do the trick?
That's cool. Goodnight, Finn.
Haha! Yeah.
Hey, Finn, you wanna have dinner instead of breakfast today? Finn?  That must be him.
Uhh.... What's going on?
Finn what's going on?
Oh, no! Have you lost your teacups, man?
Uhhhhhhhh........
Gotta figure a way to get Finn to act normal.
Ah! Give me the wallet! Or feel my claw! The wallet!
I'll cut you! I mean, rob you!
I'm a robber and I'm gonna rob this guy's life! And there's nobody who can stop me. Unless there's a hero around here.  Like there's someone here who is actually a hero in disguise. They can probably stop me.  C'mon, Finn. Be a hero.
Butt out, Randy!
Yes, Finn. Put on your awesome hat and beat me up.
I'm not talking to you, Randy!
Wait, what?
Guys, it's not what it looks like! That guy isn't really named Davey. It's Finn! He brainwashed himself to become Davey and I was just trying to inspire him to go back to being Finn.
Finn, don't let the dragon drag on, man. Don't let the dragon drag on!
Davey?!
Finn!
Glad to have you back, buddy.Yeah. Time to make sleepies!
I know!
Okay!
Uh... okay.

No she said shes coming back on the Morrow.
No man, the Morrow is her bird!
Its her bird! That thing is crazy fast! Itll only take like twenty minutes to get back once that conference is over.  Are you listening, man?  The Morrow, is a bird.
I thought it would be funny!
Heh, awesome!

Oh man, skeleton guy by a landslide! He was like Rughhh, he was like .
What? Skeleton guy was awesome! You want me to lie?
Thats me, right?
Whatre you doin?
Whatre you doin' ?!
Awh, gross! I wish I didnt!
Yeah, what is it?
Quit bein silly, Peppermint Butler!Blegh. Your tooth looks bad, dude. It smells like a garden shed in here.
Finn, I think you have to go dentist.
Just go dentist, dude.  Okay. Easy does it.
This is so bad. What did Princess Bubblegum say when you showed her?
Dude. You. Got. To. Go. Dentist.
Come on, man. It's not that bad.
Right?
Whup!
Yeah. Welcome home, buddy.
Ah-ah-ah!Safety!  Patrol! Safety patrol! Safety Oh... Were we not wearing the uniforms?
What is it, dude?
Just looks like an ordinary little town, man.
Ya jerkball!
Ow!
Whoa.
Whoa, I zoned out there for a bit. Did you win?
Donald, quit all this jerky nonsense!  Unless you wanna get gored by a forest prince!
Donny is one mixed-up dude.
You're a mixed-up dude, too!
What?
You sure this is a good idea?
You are not an outsider. You wear cute little blue shorts!
And hey, can you put on some pants?!
I have pants...  spun from spiderwebs... by pixies.
Not cool, dude.
Finn, I don't think this is gonna work.
Ooh! Teach him that little empathy song I taught you!
Dude, trade me jobs.
Butt, butt, butt! Yeah, Donny! You're lookin' good in those jeans!
Miraculous, isn't it? I just kept teachin' him my musical rules, and now, he's perfect.
What're you saying?! If you don't encourage his talent, he might revert back to jerk Do  OHHH, OHHH!  HEY, DONNY! EVERYONE SAYS YOUR SONGS ARE SUPER BALLS!!
C'mon. We can go stare wistfully at the lake.Oh man! Alright, what's next?
Wait, what about the movie at the drive-in?
Whoo!  Let's go, apple pie!
TT!
Oh yeah!
What'cha ya doin' here?
Cool cool.
Yeah, my stomach is jonesin' for it bad!
Dude, come on, we heard you.
Tree Trunks... you gonna bring some pie to Princess Bubblegum's thing?
Well... Okay...  See you later then.
Where is she?
What?  Yeah, yeah, yeah...  Is that-?!  It's Tree Trunks!
Pie! Pie!!  Lay it right here.
No apple pie?!
Have you seen my other shoe?
Ahhh! Under my shoe?! Outta here!
You shouldn'ta bought so many flavors! I had to make a sandwich for each flavor, and for each flavor combination!
Try harder!
Yeah, looks like the cost is clear!
Aw, man!
I can't ignore that!
Stoooooop!
So... where do you live?
Oh...
Go.
Yeah.
Mmmm, apple pie I've been waiting to kiss you all day!Whatever you want, mama.
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Don't, dude. For you see, that's the secret entrance to the Dungeon of the Crystal Eye!
Legend has it that the eye rests in the deepest chamber of this accursed dungeon. Man, we shouldn't even be talkin' about it, 'cause it's lunch time.
Maybe after lunch.
*Pfft* Yeah, right.
Without the aid of my magnificent powers...  ...Huh? Huh? You'd get killed down there.
Nope. Come get your sandwich.  Listen to Jake, Finn. He only wants what's best for--  Ahh! Help me! Ahh! Come put her out of her misery, dude!
I better go after him.
No, Jake! Stay here, with me...
Oh, my...
What?
Finn!
I was looking for you, knucklehead! I was so worried, that right after lunch, I plunged into the dungeon after you.
Strangest thing, though, I kept runnin' into obstacles.
Uh... I choose... sandwich!
The challenges were impossible for me.
But you would have blown right through. I kept thinking to myself, What would Finn do? Just...eh, frustrating. Know what I mean?
I'll get us out with Key Hand!
Not a problem, man. Lock Hand!
Alright, man. Let's go! We've still got a couple minutes left to steal that crystal eye and win your bet!
Just hop on my powdered doughnut, boy!
Alright, man. Let's give this crystal eye the old friendship lift.
Me, too!
Looks like that's not the answer she wanted.What? I don't know. What's with all the weird quest?
Shoot, man, are you still lady-sad about Flame Princess? Y'know, it's okay if you are.
Yeah, well, sounds like you're sad. Listen, Finn, girls is like horses. When you fall down, it's important that you get right back on againon a different horse. And there's a lot of fish in the sea. A lot of fish. A penny saved is a penny earned.
Yeah, man, yeah!
Eh, well, I suppose. Anyway, I hope this mystery cave we're looking for is as weird as Flambo's brother says it is. Maybe that'll snap you out of the Whoa! What?!
What's this train all about? No one said nothing about no train in the way!
Oh, yeah.
It's two hours later now. What the stunk?  Oh, okay.  Hey, the train just goes in a big circle! We can cut right through the middle, blingle, blongle, blungle! Come on!  Wha-hey! You know, I just had another idea! If we just stay put here on the train, we could ride it all the way to the cave.  Blingle, blongle, blungle!
Hey, Finn!
Look at all the loot that guy dropped while you whipped his butt!
Pretty fun, huh?
You wanna go see what other kind of monsters are on this train?
Cool!
Welcome back, buddy.
Yeah, this is a pretty neat train. We should come back again someday.
Heheh, yeah. I'm just gettin' a little bored, is all. All these cars of monsters are kinda all the same. It's a little boring.
All right, just one more.
Hey, hey! Empty carthink we beat it, buddy.
Okay, but this is the last one, okay?
Hey, man,  you remember we were going to that weird cave? Bet it's not too late to check it out.
Okay.
No, thank you.
You have fun. I'm just gonna watch.
Hey, also, man, aren't you, like, gettin' kinda hungry?
More than a while, dude. I've already missed my bathroom window!
'Kay! Well, we'll go back to the tree house, and I'll make us some lunch. I could make the toaster pancakes you like.
And maybe I can boil up some hot dogs, or
Aah!
Ants again?
Dude, this is the ant car. We already did the ant car. We did all the ants!
Finn, I think we should take off. I think this place is bad news for you.
Finn,  I made those biscuits with so much butter. You were just responding to the butter! This whole place is butter!
What?   Finn! This is a future crystal! Look!
That's you, dude! You're old, you're alone, and you're still fighting on this dumb train!
Nuh-uh, dude. I'm bored, I'm tired, and I'm goin' back to the tree house.  You can come with me if you want.
I'm sorry. If you wish to join me, I'll be in the tree house experiencing the joys of life and not getting attacked by gorillas made out of hair.
No, I won't, Finn.  Goodbye!
What're you doin' up here?
Are you gettin' sick of things down there, too?
Mm-hmm.
You're not gonna try and zap me, are you?
I wonder what my kids are doin'.
Hey!  I knew it!
Gotta find that kid. Hey, Finn!  Fioh!  Umm... hey, there, friend. I ain't lookin' for no trouble. Just lookin' for my friend, Finn. Maybe you seen him? About five feet tall, picks his nose, and always kinda smells funny l
Ah, jeez, Finn. I... for a minute there, I thought you were one of those twisted-lost-soul boss guys.
Wait, you are! You are one!
That's it, man! I'm gettin' you off this train whether you like it or not!
Oh, please. What're you gonna do? I'm ten times stronger than
Ah, gross!
Finn? Finn, I'm sorry. I'll stay on the train with you, I swear. Just get this stuff off of me.
You mean we're gettin' off the train?
Aw, man, don't you see that's just the train talkin'? It's got its hooks in you!
Yeah, man. That's what I'm talkin' about. That... is what I'm talkin' about.Whoo! 79th consecutive victory!  In yo fa-ace!  You okay, buddy?  Still bummed out about Flame Princess?
Hmm. I know what'll fix you up: girl's night out, boy style! First, we'll go to the salon, get yo hair did and your nails allwait, no. First, we'll go to the shops, get you a brand new hat. Then, we'll   A burgler-mer!
Dude, you can't stay here if you're gonna stank it up with your bad vibes, man!
Yeah, breakups are tough.
Princess! We need you and your Ball Blam Burglerber right away! Gunter has created a race of strangling snow snakes, or snow-a-constrictors!
AaaahLikely so.
Eh, I don't think so. We'll probably know when we see him.
Look at that weird ol' kid over there.  Man, look at his clo
Well, it had crossed my mind.
It wasn't me! It came from up there!
Also, Finn is your son.
Ahem! I said, Finn's your son. He came along way to meet you.
Finn, I know we normally come out of these things okay, but I got a bad feeling about this. Just promise me that if both my eyes get fried off, you'll fry off your eyes too.
Dude!  S'mores important junk happening! Look!
Finn, forget that loser!
Finn!
Finn! Let go! It's not worth it!
It'll be okay, dude.
Oh, yeah, that's the good news: I didn't have to! One sec.  Up you go! Check this out!  Brand new baby. The Lich is super cute now, and he smells real neat!  That sap rebooted him or something.  I like him a lot.
Okay, run. Go, go, go!Hmm.  I'll... I'll finish this later.  So tired. And also hungry...  Maybe I should... eat some
Huh? Uh...  Huh. Hmm. Everything's made of... me.
Pretty neat. I bet there's, likelike a cool city or something around here.
Nice. Jake City.
Oh, uh, hi!
Uh, good, man! Good!
Man, this place is awesome!  Ooh!  Cool dolls! They look like the rare antique kind. Maybe my kids will like them. Mm. Wonder what my kids are gonna have for dinner. Maybe pizza...
Whoa-oh! Some kind of Jake-quake...
Hey there, um...
Oh, uh, of course! Goose!
Let's see, uh...  one, two, uh... I've never been here.
Ehparty?
Do it again, Goose!
Hey, what?
Uh, what five bucks?
What? What is that?
Guess I'd better not worry about it.  Hmm. I'm hungies, Goose.
All right!  Ow! Something's wrong, Goose. Jakey can't eat any of these nachos...  but Jakey needs nachos! Aah!
Alright, lad, show me the way!
Heh. Okay.
Hmm.
Mayor, uh, I want to meet these minds.
There's no need. I've got it figured out. The tremors are happening because Jake is hungry,  and his stomach is growling. And the hungrier he gets, the worse the quakes will become.
I'll prove it!
Mention a food item.
What's in the omelet?
Look, just let me stretch outside to get something to eat, and the quakes will stop.
What?! No way! The world's not gonna end just because I go get a bagel.
Uh, peace!
Why?!
Mm.  Bagel.
Spaghetti...
Huh?
Goose?
Butbut what if Erik Adamkinson is right? What if you and all the Jake peeps disappear and I can't bring you back?
But
Just getting a snack, Goose.  Just getting a snack.And as it waded through the carnage that it had wrought, the vampire smashed their skulls just for the fun of it!
Yes way, it did. And also the vampire hunched over its victims and breathed their vaporized blood mist.
Oh, it's true, man. I heard it through a reliable source.
Yeah. Some say it haunted this very tree!
Good niiiight...
Relax, buddy. I made that story up. I was just trying to scare you.
Ha ha! I made that up, too. I was trying to scare you, and it worked!
Whew!
I wasn't scared, I was singing. I was singing my scream song. Ahh! Ahh! AAaah-uh-aah!
Don't suck our blood!
Um, yeah. Thank you for not sucking our blood.
Aw, man.
Come on, Finn. Let's get out of here.
Finn!
She's a vampire, dude!
Dude, if half the stories I've heard, and/or made up are true, vampires will kill you. There's no question!
A VAMPIRE TOOK IT! Aw, we should go house-hunting. Bag us a new house.
Finn, house-hunting is wild! You've got to try it.
Yeah, man! It is so nuts!
Bla-bla-bla-ble-ble-bla-bloo-bloop!
Sweet, things are gonna start going our way.  Hey, look, see? What'd I tell ya?
Finn, let me tell you a little something about what home really means.  La, la, la...  Home isn't a place, let me give you a clue... Home is anywhere, where people care about you...
But, home is where your heart is, Finn! And where is your heart, Finn? Well, it's right here inside you when I'm sitting here beside you!  With your lucky stars to guide you from above.
I'd rather be dancing with some babes!
Ew... Gross. This place looks gross!
Yes.
So whaddaya think, man? We did pretty good for ourselves.
Let's trash it and throw a party!
Yeah, man.
She's back!
Finn! Nooo! Vampires will kill you... remember!?
We're home as long as we're together, bla-bla-bleep-bla-bloop, remember!?
Nooo!
Finn!
I've... gotta help my buddy.
Uh oh.
Finn!
Naaah, before she bit me I used my powers to shrink all my guts and blood over my thumb, see?Oh, yeah.
What?! What happened?!
Hey, hey! Easy, buddy! That's our friend Billy! He got possessed by the Lich!
Whoa, wait a minute. How can that be if I'm still here kickin' it with my main man, Finn?
I wish that life wasn't anymore extinc
Oh yeah. Jazz.
Hmmmm.Okay, so- scooch! Okay so Im still pretty sure this old book is some warlock spell book or something .
Warlocks, dude!  You ready for some ancient feel good spell craft?
Leeeeets seeeee. You got your bibby?
Yup!
I dont feel like a good boy.
Yeah. Still though. Pretty sweet.
Yeah!
Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I!
Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I!
Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I!
Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I!
No, I dont.
Lets find some more holes.
But we never felt like good boys.Yeah, see ya later, BMO!
What the...?
This is nuts. Plus, he's usin' my toothbrush!
High-five, buddy!
Yeah. I was thinkin' the same thing.
Yeah.
You mean even better.
Okay!
Ooh, kinda stings!
Let's do another one.
Yeah!
Yeah?
You've gone crazy mad with power lust! And I'm lovin' it!!
I've been ready this whole time, dude! Just waitin' you to say when you're
That... was... awesome...Well, they look like they're having fun.
You think? I bet they taste great if you're a boid.
Hey, have you noticed we are birds now?
Look over there. That oasis looks pretty good to me.
Bon appetit!
Come on, man. We're sweet, sweet birds, and we get to eat worms. This is a unique experience.
Dude, you've been eating grubs for hours.
Yeah, you're a beast.
Hide!
Who are you?
Dang, when did you get so big?... And old?
You feeling okay, bro?
Ha, really?
Why? That's... weird.
Wow, you have a lot of saliva.  You must have a broken pipe, old timer. It's comfy, though.
Whoa! Did you just try to eat me?!
You are trying to eat me.
What're you talking about?
Sorry, man. I'm not into it.
You took it too far, man. I'm a dog, and I eat all kinds of horrible things. This is disgusting.
We're still in a bind, man. No food, no water.
I'm thirsty.
Hey, look.
It's another caterpillar.
Huh? You okay?
She's just a caterpillar, dude.
Looks like she's gonna faint.
You see?
Huh. Love is Blindthat must apply to all species.
Oh, I see. Your name is Erin, and there's a famine near your town, so that's why you're out here searching for an oasis.
Over therethe oasis!
Really? You like leaves now?
Hey, hey, hey, move over a bit. I got a rhythm going here.
This oasis is pretty romantic, huh?
So, how many kids you want to have?
And will you, Finn, take this caterpillar to be your wife, even if she becomes a flower or a bird or a bacteria, to love and to cherish till death do you part?
You may now kiss the bride.
Hey, why are you eating caterpillars?WooHoo! Hey!
Get away from me. Quit it.
Whoa!
Whoa, man. Maybe helping this starving homeless guy is wrong thing to do.
I don't know. I said Maybe
He's magic! I didn't expect this.
Think happy thoughts... Little, cute, bees, little babies, tiny, tiny bunnies.
Whoa, dude!
What a nutty guy
You smell pretty good.
Maybe you're looking at this magic gift all wrong. Now that you're a huge foot you can kick evil's butt, like, way more times as hard. You're 100% kick, man!
Don't be a siss, Finn. Here, c'mon kick my butt.
Ouch! oooh! Ouch. See, man. Let's give your foot body a shot.
Shhh shhh shhh shhh. Just be a foot for a little bit
Awesome! Dude you will never regret this. Hahaha!
Okay, when the next monster comes along, he'll step on that trigger over there, sending your giant foot body into the monster's crotch!
Shhh!
Hahaha! What'd I tell you? You're a great hero! Let's go set up some more crotch catapults so we can laugh and be heroes.
Finn, being an enormous crotch-kicking foot is a gift. Don't scorn a gift.
Town on fire! This looks like a job for foot Finn stomping ability!
You can do it, Finn. What'd I teach you, dude?
You got it! Now I'm gonna go rescue all the babies in town  --only the babies.  Get your hero on, dude!
Finn!
Oh, I can sense when you're about to cry. It's like a mother/daughter thing.
What we have to do is find out what reeks under this bridge
Ew, it's blocking out your good foot smell.
Ugh, itit smells like vomit on fire. It's like fancy cheese in an old guy's mouth.
Ahh!
Do you have any orange juice?
Yo, Finn, this place is really bumming me out. Let's get out of here.
Yeah, Finn, maybe there's another lesson to be learned here--
To accept what fate has given you  and stay a miserable foot. Gork, can we stay here in this pile of trash and rats forever?
Awesome.  Here we go.
Eh, what are you going to do about it? Probably nothing, right? If you're depressed, you'll do nothing.
Yeah!  Stay a foot! Stay a foot! Stay a foot!
Hey, Finn.
Heh heh. I can't take you seriously when you're singing, man.
Ahh!
Yeah, do it, Kim.
Whoa!
Let me get in on this. I'll form the pants.
Finn!
Maybe it was, don't give your sugar to jerks.
Well, because I kind of always wanted
I said, I kind of always wanted to be a foot myself.
It's complicated, man. You'll understand when you're older.These notes make no sense. It's all gobbledy-gak.
Hey, Princess Bubblegum trained her rat to dance. Neat.
Let's get out of here!
Right.
Let's hope this works.
We can barricade ourselves in the lab!
I think we're good. That door is made out of candy steel.
What's the matter?
I think I'm okay. It's just a little bite.
It's all good, Sweetie. I can stretch forever. Hehehehe... Hey, let's hurry up with that antidote, huh, pal?  Whooa...
You should try one of them books. Over there by the lab rat.
That's great, buddy.
Don't come near me, Sweetie!  Oh, man, I'm outta shape. I think I should just stay in here, ya know. Just in case. Ya oh.
Hurry, dude!
Finn!
You did it! I huh, uh...
Sorry about biting you, sugar.
Oh.That's weird. I had a dream too. I'll tell you about it!
So then paintings were found and everybody's eyes lit up. Cinnamon Bun smiled and said: I saw it from miles away...
What?! You didn't tell me the Cosmic Owl was there!
Dude, that means it was a prophetic dream! You have to finish the original dream! Cosmic Owl could be whispering something wildly significant! You have to get Flame Princess and Ice King to fight again so you can see the end of the dream! Make 'em fight!Ah.
What? Hey! What are you kids doing breaking the treehouse?
No way, BMO. This is our treasure.
Really? How much of it?
Whoa! We get mail?
Dang! Wildberry Kingdom got all fancy.
I don't know. I've never really spent money before. I've only stolen it or hoarded it.
So... here we are in the middle of town.
Let's parse out some dough to spend.
Sorry, man. We were just looking to spend some cash in town.  Want some?
Whoa. Spending money is kind of fun.
Just get the darn furniture.
Hmm.  Look at those gams! Hey, yo, Legs! Legs! You want a bag of money?
Well, what are you gonna do for it?
Show me.
Finn, look. I made this guy dance.
Go away, dude.
This is crazy. People do anything for money. And I've got a ton of money. Dance harder, Legs! Harder!
This bores me. You're boring! It's time to push this thing further. Middle-class berries, watch after this treasure while I'm gone.
Ahem.
Good evening.
Listen. I want to see you two do things  for this bag of money.
Yeah, nice. Goji Berry Man, you sleep on the left side of the bed normally. Now you sleep on the right!
Mr. Goji Berry, you sleep on your back nowand on top of the covers.
Turning down all this smoosh, huh? Dance instruction pays more than I thought.
Well, sure, man. As a matter of fact, you can have all the gold coins... all the gold coins you can eat!
Dinner is served!  Yummy, yummy, yummy. Hey, you kids need some desert? I'll just see what I can rustle upin the toolshed!
How much do you think I'd have to pay them to lick the dust off all this dusty stuff?
Dude, they're not doing anything they don't want to. They want my sweet cheddar, and I want to see some stuff in exchange. It's mutualfree market.
Free market!
How much coin would it take for you to be my berry foot warmer?
Oh, hey, man.
Okay, I got a plan. And this time, it's gonna involve all the money.
Princess, are you ready to earn all this cay-ash?
All of this sweet, sweet crunkle is yours if you let me...  sit on your head.
No one can say no to this much dinero. M-m-money
M-m-money
M-m-money
Or don't do that and get paid mad bucks.
Take all my money?!
Well, we were trying to get rid of all that skrilla anyway, right?
Good shot, BMO!
Let's bounce, po' boy.
How about you write it, I sign it.BMO... keep it down!
I know, but I got a headache, and I'm in a funky mood.
I don't know. I think I got restless leg syndrome.
What? No, man, it's just restless leg.
What are you reading?
Cool.
No, BMO.
No, BMO! No more!  Maybe some soup will take the edge off.
Ew! Gross! Nasty!  Hyah!
I'm sorry you were born a fly and I had to kill you, you disgusting, disgusting creature.
BMO, PLEASE!
Finn, was that you?
Probably just BMO or something.
That's weird. BMO doesn't like 30's jazz.  Yeesh. Creepy.
I didn't know we had one of those.
Hey, hey. Hey, who?
Aah!
Hey! I killed you!
Aah!  Aah! Ghost fly touching me!  Finn! Finn!
Ghost fly, man! Aah! Aah!
Come on, man. Let's get out of the house. It's a ghost fly!
No, man, ghost flies are filthy! They carry diseases, such as tuberculosis, polio, dysentery. They leave those little fly doodies on your soul.
Aah!
Thank goodness we lost him. He's gone.
We should ask what its unfinished business is. Ghosts always have unfinished business.
Nah, man, let's just get someone to banish itsomeone with serious paranormal juice.
I think so. His ways are kind of mysterious.
Thank you.
Well, huh. How about that? No biggie. We'll just hang out inside these magic circles until morning. That's when ghosts go to sleep. Yep. Just got to make it... till morning.
Don't do it, bro. It's a trap.
Dude, what are you?
Yeah, but I'm still getting a woo-jah feeling. This seems like a bad idea.
Finn? What's wrong, buddy?
Oh, Finn, you're disgusting!
Aw, that's it! I've had it with this ghost fly! I wish I were a ghost so I could punch him with my ghost fist!
What?
Finn...  All right. But first you got to give me some unfinished business so I can come back as a ghost.
Okay. What do you call a bear that only attacks guys named Paul?
Okay. Five minutes. Whoa.
Is this some kind of low-level dead world? That's a bummer.
Aah!
Aah! Oh, stuff! Aah!
Ohh! Ohh! Get away!
Aah! You killed it! Aah!
Aah! Aah! Get away!
That's right. You never finished the soup. That's your unfinished business!
And now that you've finished it, you get to ascend to a glorious, new peaceful realm.
Ahhh. Bam!  Shouldn't have tried to kill me, son!  Yes!  What's happening? Oh, BMO must be bringing me back! Yes! Yeah, BMO!
Mm. BMO?
Good job, BMO! You brought me back.Mm, oh boy.
Blech! None!
I don't wanna talk about it.
Probably an owl.  Mm... Mm, mm...  A ghost!!
Are you haunting us?
Oh, okay.
Oh. Well, let's hear more about that, honey.
Whoa, step back, nephew. We don't know she was moidered!
Whoa. Your neighborhood is... uh... very peaceful.
Right, right.
Awww...
Whoa. Smooth.
You stay, and eat cheese puffs!
Yeah, no wonder this is where the ne'er-do-wells go when they deezy. I got a feelin' these ghosts are gonna be harder to shake than Boilbee.
Cool, man. Hey, can I be bad cop now?
What's it say?
Hey, man, take it easy.
Alright. Cool off, bad cop!  This ghost ain't home, man!
He's not worth it, man.
What?
I think this place is abandoned, man.
Phew! Thanks, Clarence!
Nice!
Look on the bright side, guy! We looted all this sweet grave booty! Ka-ching!
Oops... I didn't know it was wrong.
What?! All of it?!
What's that?
This ghost ain't home, man.
What is it, dude??
Some donkus skee-bopped Ghost Princess!!
STOP!
Whoa, wait a minute. Say that again!
I know you, man! From the Squeez-E-Mart!
Huh?
CITIZEN'S ARREST!  Hey, be careful, man!!
Congratulations, you kids!
Yeah. Gimme one a' them cheesy dogs, man.
Wah-vah.
Vah.Hey, man, it's Couples Only Movie Night tonight. Who are you bringin'?
I'm bringing my girlfriend, dude.
It's couples night! You gotta bring someone you can smooch.
Don't have to smooch. You just have to bring someone you can smooch. It's, like, the rules.
Put the blanket down.  Have a seat. I want to explain some things to you about couples.
You all square?
Who you gonna call?
Yes she does! We just need to help her realize that she wants to go to the movies with you.  I'm calling Marceline.
Look, man, I've been learning a lot about vampires lately. I realized my fear was based on ignorance!
Hey, hey, Marceline. Got a favor to ask, Babe. We've gotta make Princess Bubblegum jealous, so she'll go to the movies with Finn.  Marceline? Come in. Hello?
Okay, so here's the plan.  You start saying things and  you start laughing waaay loud. And then Bubblegum...  will get jealous of you . Which will awaken her Finn love! You start us off.
That was great! Now, we begin Phase 2! It's so powerful! Wait here! Hehehe...
Whoa, where you going, man? Check it out!
It's a lute-suit! Girls love it! Trust me.
It's a lute-suit! And Finn looks adorable in it!
What she talking about, Finn?
Her idea?! What's wrong with my idea?
RidiRidiculous? What? Can you believe this girl, Finn? Huh? Can ya?
Well, fine! You can just give it back then!
Good luck getting to that movie without my help! Ruff.
Hey, man, I've been looking for you. Sorry for acting like a dweeb before. Want some leftover spaghetti?
'Bout time!
I didn't really say all that.Yeah, first day of school can be real tough. We wouldn't want Sweet P freaking out or awakening any latent evil spirits within himself!
You think he's still secretly evil, that he's still all Lich-y in there?
I don't know, Finn, he just seems so... sweet!
So far so good.
Wait, Finn. Let's just see how this plays out.
Daww!
Bye.What'ya building?
Oh, rad!
Look. It's just my size.
Hey, get away from my fort, you big stinky monster!
Yeah, me too.
Whoa, whoa!
And I'm Jake.
Princess Bubblegum, are you okay?
Aw, you should go to bed.
Okay. C'mon, Goliad.
Uhm...

Ah, nah, these kids ain't nothin'! Kids groove doozyploon! Check this out.
Hey, there kids, who wants to play--
Uhh, easy now children. Easy-
Listen up, you kids better stop donkin' around! You're gonna mess up Goliad!  It's my way or the highway, get it? I'm Don Juan Cherry Tempo! Now march, glib blobbit!
Don't be acting all crazy.
Wow, holy shmow!
Uh, you know, Finn... maybe this isn't such a good idea, actually.
C'mon, Goliad. Let's go see Princess Bubblegum.
Goliad's got mind control powers!
Ugh, eyeball... Just tuck that eyeball back in its hole.
Wow, man, so, like... I guess they're so evenly matched that it's a stale  It's a staleDeal.
Aaah...
Hello?
Ooh!
It's nice of you to wanna be our secretary... but we don't need one.
Alright, LSP. Come inside.
Jake has saltines.
'Sup, LSP?
Yup.
Heh heh heh! Ker-ploop.
We gotta bust through this wall!
Sometimes, after an adventure, he likes to sit out there and think.
LSP, YOU'RE WEARING GARBAGE FOR CLOTHES!!!!Ha ha! Yeah, he knows how to get things started.
It's probably a computel gleetch.
Now comes some real trouble! It's Bouncy Bee! He's gonna get that sun, man!
Yeah, that was cool. Oh, oh, you missed a coin, dude, go back!
Hunny Bunny!
Man, you are hot tonight! Think you can do it this time? Can you beat Sleepy Sam?!
Remember: use a combo move!
Spin, down, up, left, faster, dude! Right, left, down!
BMO, is there a way for us to get in the game for real?
...Finn?
...oh, right! Heh heh. Good night, BMO.  Time for bed!
Look! There's the sunshine we gotta protect!  And there's a hole we're supposed to go down!  And there's you...doing whatever you're doing.
Mmm. That sunshine feels good. Feels good all over!
Beep boop! Beep boop!
In a game, I can be who I virtually am.
Hey, what stinks?  Smells like...
Jumpin' over this pit is easy, remember? We could do this backwards with our eyes closed!  Ahh! It's burning!
Haha. What, man?
Check it out! Extra lives!
Ow! It burns! Ow! Haha!
...that makes me just want to sit here and feel bad.
Ow! Whew! That was pretty intense, dude!
Yeah!
What's that sound?
Whoa!
Easy-peasy, livin' greasy!
No!
Finn's dead! Finn! No!  Why?  NO!!! Curse this false virtual world!  Oh, Finn!
Oh, Finn! You're alive!
Oh my gosh. Let's never die again! There's nothing more precious than a life! Ooh, dude, look. Coins! Oh man, oh man!  Heeheehee!  Ooh! Oh, man, dude, these coins are thick! Let's take 'em back to the real world! We'll be filthy stinkin' rich!
No!
Let's get outta here, Finn!
Look, Finn. The most important thing to remember is that I still have one giant coin.
Hey, that's him right there!
Okay!
Let's get outta here, man! We're gonna die!
Wait, dude! The bomba!
Wait, dude.  Hmm.
What if I...?
But we need the bomba!
Finn!
Yeah, man. And I got my coin!  What?! A penny?!  BMO!  Oh no! Are you alright buddy?
Aw man, don't kill us! We don't have extra lives!
We'll save you, BMO! Finn, go!
Listen! You got this, man! I know you-  I know you can do it, buddy! You got this!
Woohoo!  You did it, Finn! I knew you had the stuff! Right, BMO?
BMO!
Yeah, yeah!
We were only joking!Aaaah!  Aaaaah!  Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl!  Uh! That sounded horrible, man!
Exactly!
Oh, wait up. I gotta finish tuning my viola.
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
Wait, you were gonna wee-wee if I was the Gut Grinder?
Then I am the Gut Grinder!
I'm just kiddin', everybody. I'm not the Gut Grinder. I'm...  Jake the Dog! Woohoo!
Hey, I'm not cute!
Huh? Oh, heheh.
What?!
Oh... heheh. What? No!  Noooo...
Bye, Soft Village.
Hey Finn, my feet fit these prints pretty well. Hm, what if I really am the Gut Grinder?
That is true. Check this out.  I'm Finn the Human and I stink at viola!
There's a lot of interesting smells in poop.
Wait, what happened?
Th-that's ridiculous.
Oh yeah.  Ooh ooh ooh.  I am not... the Gut Grinder. Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh.
Hey! Y'all are the ones who are cute. I'm hot.
Aaah!
I'm not cute! I'm--mnh,  ooh.
Ruff, ruff, grrrr...
Wha--?  Where am I?
I'm not cute. I'll mess you up.
Finn...? What if I am the Gut Grinder?
What if I'm, like, stealing gold in my sleep?
Wha--? Yo, Finn, that is creepy, man.
Well, when do you sleep?
Well, there's gotta be a time when you're not watchin' me... that--that I--that I might be stealin' gold unconsciously!
I love it!  Launch in 3, 2, 1!
I'm Groucho!
Wha--?  Finn, it's me!
Yeah, I-I know you think it does, Finn--but this is different. I'm scared, Finn.
No, Finn... I belong behind bars. Look at the evidence--I really am the Gut Grinder.
Then... why am I in jail? Only Gut Grinders go to jail.
Huh? Grrrr... not cute.  Am I the Gut Grinder?  All the clues fit!  I must be the Gut Grinder!  And I want GOLD!
Grrrr! I'm not Jake--I'm the Gut Grinder! Now give me that gold tooth!
Rawr! Now give me that tooth!
Huh?  Ah, stay away from my viola!
I also remember that you stink hard at playing it. And dookie is radical, man! I don't care what anyone says.  Wha--huh? What? Where am I? Finn, is that you?
Whoo!  I guess I went nuts.
It's good to have you pat my back.
Cut it out!
Ow! Hey! Don't touch us! OWWWW!Woo!
Ehh, that made my teeth hurt.
My neck sort of hurts.
Yeah, I could go for some blood.
Yeah, what if we turn evil? I'll hafta start wearing cologne.
Sorry, bro.  Oh, snap! I feel... stronger.
We're invisible!
Hey. Then how come we can see each other?
Wow! LSP's a hobo!
She must recognize our voices.
Weeeee!
Geez, we really scared her.
Ohhh!
We wanna fly!
Peace.
I think they're testing our vampire abilities.
Yeah.Yeah!
No... I'm not...
Dude, what?!
What're you doing, man?
EEH!
Rrrr... HEY!
AAAH!  I wanna help you outta this, man, but... she scares the filling out of my doughnut. Let's just leave.
FINN!  Don't worry, dude! I'll figure something out!!
Rrr... Don't you worry, Finn. I'll get you outta there. I've got a perfect plan!  AAH!  I'm not running away, Finn! This is just part of my plan!!
Don't worry, dude. I'm comin' to help you. YAAAAH!!
Sorry, Finn.
Oh, no! My buddy is totally under her vampire spell!  Die, unholy thing!
I'm stakin' that vampire and settin' you free, no matter how terrified I am!
She's still controlling your mind with evil! Now, back off and let me vanquish her from existence!
I love you, brother. YAAAH!
What are you even talkin' about, dude?!
MARCELINE!  Where is she?!
I did?! I did! Yeah!  I saved my bro from a scum-sucking vampire!!You want some more eggs, BMO?
How 'bout you, Finny? Need a refill?
I don't know if stomachs work like that, dude.
Can't argue with that!  Ahh...
Hello? Lady, it's gonna be fine. Mm-hmm. Alright, I love you, too. Bye.
Yeah, man. She's worried about introducing me to her parents at lunch today. She thinks they're gonna freak out.
No way! That's our treasure! Wait. I've got it, dude! I'll invite them over early, smooth them over using my personality, and we'll all be best friends before Lady gets here so she doesn't have to feel nervous! It's perfect! I'll just send them a quick Prism-gram.  Mm-hmm.
Hold on. It's still converting the light waves into brain waves.  Ahh... They're into it, dude!
Well... she didn't really say, but it might have somethin' to do with the Rainicorn-Dog Wars.
Horrifying wars. For thousands of years, rainicorns battled dogs over territory in the Crystal Dimension... but Lady and I are cool.
...Nah. That could never happen.
AAAH! I'M A MORON!
I'm ready to hear your plan, homie.
You know, I thought painting ourselves rainbow-color using condiments and stuff from the fridge so we could pretend to be rainicorns was a good idea when you pitched it to me five minutes ago, but now I'm not so sure, man.
No, no, no, new plan. First, we're gonna clean this place up, and then  Huh?!
AAAAH...  LET'S HIDE AND BURN THE HOUSE DOWN!
. Hello.
Uh-huh.
Y-yeeeaaah...
I can explain!! I can explain!!
You think I'm a rainicorn?
Uh, well, hey! Come on in! It's awesome to finally meet you both!
Uh... that's um...
Uh... y-yes!  Get outta here, goblin! Go fetch us some rainicorn snacks!
Come on, homie, help me!
Uh... please, c-come upstairs.
My goblin will bring us snacks in a moment.
Well, ask me whatever you like, Ethel, Bob!
Well... he's actually a human.
Uh... No problem, Bob!
Uh, s-say it again?
Ohhhh!  Cablatapuamba! I thought you said Kabloderaga!  Ah, man, I love gettin' down and dirty with some Cablatapuamba! Ha! Y'all should go first, though.
I...
Finn!  Dude! I have to show Lady's parents that I have rainbow powers! I need homie help!
You're the best, homie.
Haha!  Cablatapuamba!
Whoo! Oh, yeah!  Finn?
I, uh... Oh. Um... let's do it!
I'm sorry.
Yo, my bad! I'll get 'im!  Hey, man. How's it goin'?
I know, I know, I'm sorry. But they really like me. Your plan is working perfectly!
Look, Finn, you know I got yo back fo'-eva', but right now, you're the only one who can help me. Come on, homie.  Homies help homies.   Hey, guys. You ready to get this game goin' again?
Wohhh, no. You're my guests. Let me take care of you.  Homie... help me cook something, please.
Thanks, Finn.  Okay. Don't worry about a thing. Finn'll make a great lunch. He's a little raw, but he's got great taste.
Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man....
Come on, stop it, guys! Come on, y'all, I said stop!  NOW, THAT'S ENOUGH!!! Nobody's eating Finn!! He's not my butler, and he's not food! Finn is my friend!  I'm sorry I let the lies get so far outta hand. I just got so scared of losing Lady!  But if they hate me, so be it. No more lies.
Yeah, I just...  Look, I'm sorry about everything. I was
Uh... uh...  Lady?!
She said she worried that they'd freak out... 'cause her parents are bananas for dogs!
Yeah! She says a dog saved her dad in the war!
So... this isn't human?
Ew... Soy?  FINN, YOU'RE DELICIOUS!Then hold my hand, dude!  Whoooop!
Heh heh heh.  How's the Mini Queen?
Mini Queen must've stepped in somethin' funky.  No... It's not tiny feet I'm smelling! This way!  Whoa!
Do you know whose sword this is?! This is the sword of Billy!
Oh, yeah! Hahaha! He fought a bear!
I know, I know! Be cool!!
I wanna be the dog version of you!
Heh. Yeah. I-I'm a little paunchy... but I could do some sit-ups!
Heh. See, that's where you're wrong... 'cuz watch!  Ah... ah...
Heh... I'm gonna pass out...
What other way is there?
Me, too!
I love you, Billy! I got a secret crush on you, Billy!
Relax. It'll be easy not to beat up on monsters and still help people.
Oh...
Sorry. We don't beat stuff up anymore.
I could teach 'im how to not be such a spaz.
Say no more.  Come on, Finn.
To make you somethin' to eat!
Trust me. This is a way better way to help 'im.  Gruel! Get your free gruel!
Yeah, we're really helpin' people!
Dude! You're alive!
Dude. Gruel.
Dude... how much of that potion did you use?
What does cobble mean, anyway?
Did you fix that shoe with a magic nail?
Cool!
Dude, suckin' at somethin' is the first step towards bein' sorta good at somethin'. You and I are like little baby Billys right now, and we're sucking on our first bottle of nonviolent milk!
Whoa, what?!
You up for some serious plastic surgery?
Dude, did you use a magic nail again?
....Yeah...?
Not if we run away, Finn! We'll have to live in halfway homes and be cannibals! We'll survive!
Then I'll moan with ya, buddy.
Yoooouuu'rrre weeeelcooome...
Aw, man, this grass-bag again??  HEY, EVIL-DOER!  Um... could you keep your evil-doing quiet? Finn is dealing with some heavy stuff over here.
Wait, didn't she say not to take advice from old peo
Cha!!
And we've got exciting news!
She's right here.
You saved 'er.
We're his heroes!!
Ha! Haha! I love you, Billy!!Man, who cares if it's honey? You stink anyways.
Oh, snaps!
Oh, dang!
Oh, nah, I'm just trying to show you how many weeks ya got.
Awesome.
Dude, you see my masterpiece coming together, right?
Well, put some meat in there!
That's Meat Man's meat.
I don't know. I can't read his mind.
No!
It's wasted, man.
Rainicorn, don't eat 'im.
Meat Man. Meat Man, I'm sorry, Meat Man, I didn't mean it, man.
Hey, Finn, you awake yet?
I had a dream about Meat Man.
I think I'm gonna stop eating Meat Man.
Good job. Good job, the Ice King.
C'mon, man, let's get outta here!
Uh, I think so.
Uh, hey, guys? I don't think this ice dome is gonna last long.
Hey, I'll kill you!
No way, man!  You already messed up enough stuff. You're probably gonna kill us, too.Yeah!
Uh-huh.
I found it at the dump and then buried it without lookin' inside.
Whoa! And I found it?
Heh-heh-heh. Let's have a secret screening! I'll make some fliers for it!
There. Now nobody will bother us.
This is so exciting!
Dude... what are we watchin'?
Can we fast-forward?
What?!?
Hey, pause it, BMO.
Okay... Well, why don't I make us some snacks? So I don't have to watch... this...
You're Gunther.
What? Oh, but I was so clear in my flier!
Wait! Wait!
You guys are checking too loud!
Cool.
Fast-forward, BMO.
I'm gonna take a nap...
Maybe he's talkin' in secret code.
Well, how do we decode the secrets?
Well, who do we call?
Yeah, they're really stupid, but, y'know... Maybe they're encoded or whateva.
Ohh......AAAAAAAAAaaa  aaaloutte, gentille Alouette, Alouette, je te plumerai. Je te plumerai la tete! Je te plumerai la tete! Alouette,  je te plumerai!
Yeah, it's kinda chilly in here.
This is so fascinating...
Yeeeesh.....
Don't worry, BMO!
Drrr-AMA bomb!!
It's from me, too.
Uh... thanks.
Uh...The Princess of the Fire Kingdom?
I was trying to help you get over your Princess Bubblegum sad times by hooking you two up. But she's evil, man!
Dirty?  Oh. No, really man! Her dad said she was evil!
Hmmm..
Eeeeeeeeehhh, ok.
You sure you're not into any other princesses? What about Wildberry Princess? She's small and plump. You could sleep on her like a pillow. Could be nice.
Guy drops one piece of ham in the snow and he never hears the end of it! Snap out of it! She's burning cute little flowers!
Finn!
Hold on!
Eaoww.. Toasty buns.
She's headed for Goblin Kingdom! We need to defeat this fiery she-beast!
Finn, what's more important? Your love for that screwball dame, or being a hero and savin' the lives of innocent goblin folks?
Alright, c'mon! Let's go build fire-proof suits.
Dude, slow down or your fire suit will be junk.  Ooh. Is bags of old bread fire-proof?
Oh, plops, we forgot about the game.
DUUUUDE! I feel like I can touch the heavens!  And sock angels!
I'll put it out!
Oh...  I need your help Finn! This one's too big!
Mmm!
FINN!  Oh my Glob, man. Everyone's dead, man! They're all burned. There's barbecued bods EVERYWHERE!
Hah. I'm just kidding. I saved 'em. Everyone's fine, see?
So. How'd everything go with Flame Princess?
Whoa! How did it feel?Then let's burn its butt down to the root rubbin's.  Finn, I can feel a bunch of eyeballs peepin' us from the woods.
Dude! The tree's about to 'splode its evil juice all over!
Is he crushin' you, man?!
Oh...!  When you see the wicker devil in tree afterlife, tell 'im Jake says, Hello.
Hey, buddy, you okay?
Wha..,?
Hmmmm... Dude, why're you so huggy?
Hmm...  You've got a fever, man.
I think you need a good night's sleep.
You feelin' better today?
Good. Hey, you think we have enough candy litter?  Litter for lunch! Mmm!
Yeah, buddy, but you were pretty huggy last night... buddy.
I'm just sayin' you were really clingy.
No. I have a theory, ...but I don't like it.
Your questionable behavior started about an hour or so after you got hugged by that wolf man, right?
Well, I've been thinkin' that maybe that wolf man wasn't what he seemed. Maybe he was some sort of hug wolf. Yeah, here it is.  Hug wolvesa subset of wolf men which roam the countryside with a fervid hug lust. Every night, hug wolves must go out and hug people to satisfy their insatiable craving for hugs. To become a hug wolf, one must be hugged by an alpha hug wolf on the night of a full moon.!
Yes. So you must be a beta hug wolf. A lower-level creature.
Lemme, um... read the book a little more. Says there's no known cure.
No hugs!!
What's wrong, BMO?
Hmm. Well, that plant's not gonna protect you.  You can get this under control, buddy. ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??
I said... ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??
I'm tryin'a' getcha to shout.
Never mind. Now. I want you to think about hugging a cactus. How would that feel?
Good, good, you're doin' great!
No, you can't hug anything.
Oh, no, the hug lust is already takin' over your brain!
Finn... say something to reassure me.
BMO! Strobe light mode!
Back, beast!
Finn? Finn?
You hugged... everyone.
Candy People, let's make sure that Alpha Hug Wolf pays for what he's done!!
Cinnamon Bun, you watch over Finn!
Let's go, boys!!
I smell someone bein' hugged right now!
That hug be your last, demon!
No huggies!  Eh... Finn... I've failed you.
This is the biggest hug that's ever existed!
Can I get a hug?
AAAH!Bad biscuits make the baker broke, bro.
Dinner roll!
Oh... You got 'im.
Your constant harassment of the female gender makes me sick.
What is goin' on in there?!Ready?
Just go back to the Fire Kingdom and get 'em. Problem solved.
That ain't me.
Flambo!  For a second, I thought the princess was farting.
They smell like an old lady's bathroom.
I said that as a compliment. Like, it reminds me of grandma. I love my grandma.
Whoa!
Right, right.
Now what?
The kind we are looking for.
Dude, the voice
This way!
To the left
I don't think it's them.
Whooaaa.
I'm okay. I think I hear that hissing voice down this way!
Whoops. Tell me next time, I can't think in the future.
Vent ahead.
No untied shoe.
Vent
You baffoon! Where's your partner with the untied shoe?
Hmmmm. Sufferin' succotash.
I have an idea. We'll go on stage, act like two conspirators, you will have one shoe untied, I'll talk with a hiss voice, we'll talk about how we want to kill the king, as we do these, we'll study the faces of the audience, a move of guilty reactions.
Thanks! It's an original idea, by me.
Hey co-conspirator!
Shhhhhh sssssomebody might here our evil plot.
Psst, the audience.
You think that's one of them.
Water, man. Enough of it to put out the King's fire.
Whoa, what!?You gonna do the thing again?!
Nice.
Man...  Dancin' is rough!
Hey, man. I'm Jake.  I'm Jake.  Hmmmm...
Uh, Finn? I think that bear is followin' us home.
I dunno, Finn. This guy seems kinda weird.
Mmmmm...
What?
Eh, okay.
Heh-heh. Um... Yeah, okay.  Sweepy-sweepy-sweepy. Sweep sweep sweep. Sweepin'!
Mmmmmm...
This guy just busted me up my chops, Finn!
Mmmm... Yeah, I guess. Well, anyway, it's gettin' pretty late. Probably time for everyone to go back home to their own houses.
Shhh. Come with me. Ya gotta see somethin'. This bear's wiggy, Finn. It's wearing your clothes and dancin' around all crazy.
What?! NoJust! ... Rrrr!
Aw, man!  Oh, ya gotta believe me, Finn. I swear, he was, like, all wigged-out, was dancin'...
Oh.
No.  I guess not.
Yeah, okay.
You're not even a little weirded out by this?
Yeah, I get it. You don't need to tell me that every time you make Finn cakes.
Hey, what are you doin'?!  Why, you little...! Tryin' to set me up, eh? You think you're so smart, but this time, I'm ready.
Uh, nope. The bear did it, and I've got proof. I taped the whole thing.
Ju What?! No, man, he was tryin' to frame me, Finn! He's tryin' to steal your identity! Why can't you grok that?!
Ohh, fine, then that's just great. Then you and M.C. Cool Friend can go stink it up together at your stupid cool Finn party all by yourself, cause I'm not going!
What? Your party, man. Tonight? In the woods?
Huh?! Well, who did, then?!
...I knew it.
See, dude? He's not just jackin' your style. He's jackin' your whole you! Jackin' yo you up!
He got in close and used you. Now he's feedin' nuts to your ex-girlfriend!
He's trying to replace you, and he's already got everyone convinced he's you! He didn't really like you.  He used you.
Wait up, guy!
Me, too.
I guess he's got a heart of gold after all.
Finn, are you nuts?! We can't give that book away! It's, like, crazy-important!That's really cool, PB!
Isn't it cool, Finn?
It's letting up. Hey, Finn, come on, let's go do something.
BMO, put on a game.
Oh, Finn.... Uncle Jakey's gonna find you a new love interest.
Finn, I'm going out for a quick.... walk in the woods.
BMO, you look after him with your camera-eyes.
Ok, good.
Woman!
I'll save you, wash tub princess!
You're safe now, Miss... Flambo?!
I did think that.
Hey.... You're pretty plugged-in, Flambo. Do you know any princesses Finn's age?
She's from Fire Kingdom? I think I'll die if I go in there.
Ow...
BMO-cam on.
Ugh... Hang in there, buddy.
Yo! What up? I'm Jake, Jake the  Dooug.
Could have told me this sooner.
Good morrow, Majesty!  I am Sir Jake, Baron of the Grasslands!
Uhk-uhg... I come as an envoy of Prince Finn.
Yeah and he's the same age as your daughter.
Umm.... Oh, Prince Finn is AWESOME!
A gift?! Sire, Prince Finn sent, uh... three gifts!
The first gift is  um-um-um this water bottle.
Uh, Prince Finn hated him too.
For your second gift, a, uh... hmmmm oh!
Oh, Finn, I'm so sorry!
No, wait! Uh-um,  Prince Finn is here!  He's riiight... here!
Greetings, Flame King! My final gift is your favorite thing in the world.
Uh, yes!
Eucalyptus! Eucalyptus!
Dude, don't cry.
Can't help it! I'm in love with Bubblegum!
She's too old for you.
I don't care!
Come on! Flame Princess seems into you.
No, no, no! Only Bubblegum!
Ouw, Finn!  Finn, Finn, Finn, Finn stop man....
Ahh-ahh!
Fiiiinn.
Huh?!
Yeah!
Whaaaat?!
She seems normal.
You know, on second thought, ...we're not really each other's types.
I changed my mind. I don't like you.
Uh, nothing.  Bye, Flambo.
Finn! I really messed up.
Finn, buddy, you gotta help me. I made a mistake.
The Princess of the Fire Kingdom?An artisan of pickling, and now just one remains.
And now just one  I can't do this, man! I-it just can't be over!
No, these picks were made by our friend to be mouth-loved!
We have to honor his memory with a final taste of his genius.  Get ready for the dream ritual.
Finale!
Quick, to bed! This has to be the last thing we think about!
Okay... dream!
Whup! Oof.  I love you, Everything Burrito.
Huh, what?
Hey, man, you're shaking it all wrong!
Shh. Let me show you how.. it's... done!
No, I'm showing this Whoaaaa!
You made an oath. Okay.
Nah, I'll just stretch into a tree.
Pshhh. Please, not even.
Uh, because Kee-Oth was right there! A-and there were traps! I didn't have no blood this whole time, so I'm totally out of it. Uuuuuhhh...
Bacon pancakes, makin' bacon pancakes
Bacon pancakes, makin' bacon pancakes
Take some bacon and I'll put it in a pancake
Bacon pancakes, that's what it's gonna make
Bacon pancaaake!
Dude, what is the deal?
Prismo, I'm right here! Where you going, bro!?
Wait up, man, how're you alive!?  Finn and I saw your old man host body get destroyed by the
The Lich?!
Wait, why is this happening? It's like a rerun of the worst junk.
Lich life-sucks Prismo's dream host, eliminates Prismo forever. Ugh, it's mad gris bro. And then the Space Police, or whatever they're called, show up because boppin' Prismo is a cosmic crime. I remember feelin' like someone had peeled a layer away from my brain, and my reality was no longer anchored to any point of reference, and I had to fight to keep from being crushed under the weight of an unforgiving new paradigm of ultimate reality. So cool, man. So why am I seeing this again?
Uhhh, that's cool...
Uhh, that's cool, but do you know what's really cool? Tough guy contest!  Whoo-hoo!  Tough boys!
Come on, man! Tough Guy contest me!
Whoa, Finn, how'd you get over there?
Finn, when I die my individual Earth consciousness is going to go all over everywhere while Glob tallies my deeds.
I'm going to all around you , in your nose, in your dreams and your socks...
Yeah, that's what I said, in your dre
Fallen ally, fallen ally, you're home now in the sky.
I guess I'm headed towards that door..
Hehe, all these dudes and their lady problems...
What if the whole world was just some goof's dream? Man, that would be stupid. Whoa!
Rrrm, wait a minute... What is this!? This couldn't be a...oh Grod!  Permanent, opposing, industrial-strength, magnetic bed!  Hand-hewed from a single tree  Oh, man! Look at this mattress!  What is it?  Smells like a blend of cashmere...  Mohair, silk and wool maybe...  The thread count on this is in the thousands! And it's filled with...  Down feathers of a baby griffin! That's illegal!  Glass of milk... This feels like a trap designed by some kind of sick genius!
Well...  hats off to you sir or madam, your trap was a success!
Oh my blahs!  It's like I'm getting Eskimo kisses from an army of angels!
Finale!
Quick, to bed! This has to be the last thing we think about!
Okay... dream!
Wait up, man, how're you alive!?
Finn and I saw your old man host body get destroyed by the
Where you going bro? Wait up man, how're you alive?
Hey, Finn, what's going on?
No, bro, don't tear me away from nirvana. Wait, nooo!  Oof!  I'm okay now.
Prismo?! You're alive!
Cool, dude!
Welcome back, Prismo.Uh, sorta. Wait, bro, what are you doing up here? You know I'm not actual armor, right?
Nooo!
You were a little rough with the Jakesuit today, bro. You mashed up my doggy bag pretty hard.
When you're in my body, it pushes out my brain, so I have no control.
I bet you wouldn't be saying that nonsense if I wore you as a suit.
OK bro, let's see how you like it. I'll bring the pain!
Haha yes! Time to bring the pain!
Eh?
You give up?
Hmm. I thought I was. This is hard. I can't even make a fist. How do you control my body so well?
A-ha! Here we go! Dream Journal of a Boring Man, Volume 12.
There's all kinds of pain, Finn.
Ah. Okay, let's see. Ooh, this one looks good. And it's not too long, only seven pages!  Okay, here we go.   In my dream, I was eating jasmine rice. But it was also brown rice. And it was also my mother.
Huh? Where am I?  Oh, yeah. Hey, Finn, how long have I been out?
Say what?! Why are you still reading?
No, I'm hungry.
Oh, I didn't know we were allowed to call truces. I'll totally remember that the next time my doggy bag is hurtling towards a fence post.
Wait a sec, you just gave me an idea!
Ta-da!
Mmm-mmm.
I assure you, it's delicious.
Yummy!
Admit you're wrong, and you can have some of this delicious meatloaf!
So?
Tell me I win, dude!
Alright. Say goodbye to Flame Princess thinking you're cool! I'm gonna embarrass the Bjork outta you!
Nope! Just doin' the kind of stuff I do all the time!
Don't you wanna see more?
Oops! Busted.
Yeah, I'm causing Finn pain. We have a bet going on.
What?
Hmm!
I'm right here.
What's T.V. doing here? I thought all the kids found apartments.
Ha-ha! That's my boy. Momma's basement baby.
Oh, it's this bet we're doing. It's not really a bet. It's more like a showdown. I'm trying to get him to admit that it's hard when someone wears you as a suit. How do I win the bet, Lady?
Yes!
The Universe is going to have a full-on make-out session with you, bro. I'm talkin' minimum tier 8. Behold!
Oh no, bro, that's just fortuitous circumstance!  Allow me to take advantage! here, pup pups! Want some kibble? Want steak flavor? Steaky-steaks?
How you like it, bro? Pretty painful, huh?
Oh yeah, bro! The pain-train has arrived at the station! Choo-choo!
Look, just say stop, and you won't get burned.
Okay, bro. This'll pretty much wreck up your whole life, so think about it.
Okay...I'm gonna lower you some more...probably gonna cook up your brain.
Dang, he's flippin' crazy! This isn't gonna do anything, he's never gonna give up!
You're right, man. My bruises are hickeys from the Universe. And I should just accept that.
Yeah, in my face.
Dangit, Finn.
Yes!Oh, hey, Finn!  So you got my map?
Ah, it's goin' great. I really feel like I fit in,  so to speak.
Nah, I think I was just gonna keep being a brick for a while.
Finn, ever since I was little, I wanted to see what it's like to be a brick in a brick shack when the brick shack falls down. And this shack is gonna fall down. Just look at it. Like sandcastles in the sun, baby.  You're too young; you wouldn't understand.
What? No, man, bricks don't stay in touch!
Aww. You tell that little goofball I said hi.
Oh. Really? So soon?
Yeah.
Bye! Okay, back to being a brick.  I'm so bored.
Ooh, I'm starting to get a little tippy in my teacups.
A bunny!
Looks like our long-eared friend is on to something. Bunnies love to dig. He's making a supreme effort, and I think I can guess why.
That's right. A carrot, grown out here free and wild, probably the result of a seed pooped out by a passing bird.
But what's this? A mysterious rustling in the bush. Could mean trouble. Mr. Bunny seems to think so. His sensitive whiskers quiver at the hint of imminent danger.
Unfortunately for Mr. Bunny, this is what nature is all about. It's a male deer. Not a threat to Mr. Bunny in the predatory sense, but still above him in the food chain. Mr. Bunny, wishing to avoid an encounter, hops away to safety.
Wow, deers are jerks.
What?! Arrrrrgh! No! I had no idea.
Hi, BMO.
No.
It's not about the bunny! The bunny is incidental to the brick experiment.
Forget about the bunny.
Finn? Are you still there? Finn? BMO?
Mr. Bunny retreats to its warren. Its homemade comfort is some consolation to help pass the hungry night. Twilight falls on the peaceful forest, a twilight unaware of the struggles it both soothes and conceals. The crickets begin to stir, rehearsing their musical rhapsodies. In the distance, flashes of heat lightning illuminate a purple summer sky. Even angry deer, at last, must come to rest. And so it is with our erstwhile antagonist, who has disappeared into a stand of trees, perhaps to dream of tomorrow's pointless battles.
Oh, my Gob, it's a crazy storm! This might be it! This weather might knock the whole thing down!
If a definition of bravery exists, then this must be it. A lone bunny, facing off against the elements, ineffectually pushing around some twigs with his pink bunny nose, a symbolic gesture, perhaps, but sometimes that's all we have. The wind is beginning to pick up. It's becoming clear that Mother Nature has not just knocked on the door, she has come in, sat down, and poured herself a drink. Mr. Bunny has no friends, no family, no loved ones of any kind. The wind is really picking up now. Small puddles gathering around the entrance to Mr. Bunny's cozy home are beginning to grow in size and connect with one another. It won't be long now. But what's this?! Looks like this unflagging little hero of a bunny will have some help, though! A family of friendly beavers appears to have taken up the cause.
Often called nature's architects, these intrepid mammals are sparing no effort to shore up the endangered burrow. Here's an unusual sight. It's a Sea Lard! You'd expect to see a few mudscamps out in weather like this, but here we have a rare treat indeed. This little beauty is pretty far outside of her natural habitat, but I've heard it said by wise old salts schooled in ancient maritime lore that storms will sometimes blow them off course to a remarkable degree. Looks like we've got some pretty good evidence tonight. Yes, sir, sometimes those old sailors know what they're talking about. It's a triumph of experience versus the secondhand verities of musty academic tomes. This feisty Sea Lard is pitchin' right in to save the rabbit hole, belying its slothful reputation. She uses her prodigious swiveling behind to increase the size of the hole, while the beavers continue to reinforce the sides with straw and stick. Times like these, supposed cruelty and indifference of the natural world, all too often its most salient feature, pale before the nobler instincts of even our most humble kin.
In the morning light, few signs remain of the summer storm that battered this idyllic glen. The beavers are finished with their work and are heading home. The Sea Lard looks like she's gonna wander the woods for a while. Maybe she'll find her way back to the ocean and write a novel about her experiences. Mr. Bunny is exhausted but can rest easy knowing that his home is secure. But alas, the bunny's rest is short-lived. The deer is back.
The deer, perhaps confused by the antler-like appearance of Mr. Bunny's protective dam, is now testing the situation.
The bunny is unsure of where this is going.
And with a single smash from the deer's powerful front hooves, the bunny's home is under attack! Mr. Bunny has hopped to safety and can only watch as the deer continues its relentless rampage on the only home he knows. A couple more mighty smashes, and the damthe dam has been breached! Water is now flooding in! The deer continues its attack! This deer's misplaced rage, combined with its size and weight, is more than enough to bring down the weakened walls, which are now starting to give, aided by the unforgiving weigh from the tree above. Even Mr. Deer, in his blind fury, seems to sense what's about to happen as he steps to one side!
It's over. The warren has been destroyed.
An injustice of astronomical levels. Words fail me.
Actually, he doesn't seem that upset.
He's on his feet, checking out his new surroundingseven the deer is impressed! As if confused by the events, he performs a comical double-take and retreats into the forest. Ladies and gentlemen, this bunny is indomitable!
This bunny has the right attitude. Who cares about being a brick in a wall of a fallen-down shack? There's something bigger than that, and the bunny has answers.  Teach me, Mr. B!
Aw.
Hey, Finn.
That sounds good.Hey dudes! They're still pretty sleepy. Sleepy little sweeties.  Pups, meet everybody!  Yeeees!
Charlie,  T.V.,  Viola,  Kim Kil Whan, and this sweet little lady is Jake Jr.!
Yeah, Finn. I love all my little babies so much.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to them!
No way! Check this out!  Thanks honey!
It's Mom's manual for raising beautiful children.
Aw, BMO! When was the last time you washed your controller?  WHOA!
Um, ah, I-I think it's gettin' kinda late. Um, puppies need sleep.
Uhhh, Finn, you should go home. I'm gonna live with Lady and the pups from now on. I'm a dad now. It's a pretty big whoop.
We'll hang out soon.
I'm gonna be the best dad ever!
Breakfast time.
Sorry honey, I'm on guard duty.  You're sleepin' for both of us tonight.   Breakfast ideas for pups.
Hmm. . Kinda like a dead person.  They're just asleep. It's okay. Ya gotta be a tough dad.  AAAAHHHH!  The puppies aren't moving!
AHHHH!  Saved 'em! Mom's manual knows best!
You guys are getting big! Okay!  Excuse me. Mom's manual suggests that I read you guys a story.  This was your daddy's favorite book when he was cute like you!
This is a lot darker than I remember! Um, gimme a sec.  Is this appropriate for babies?
Yeah, okay. Sorry sweeties, Mom's manual says no.
Take 'em out for fresh air huh?  There m- there might be a giant fox out there.  Or some-some other predator.  Hey!  This's not for babies!
Okay everyone, your mom wanted me to take y'all out side.  Ah ah ah, be careful.  No Charlie, no. Too much germs, you know?  Everybody just stick together and don't do anything and we can all take a nap.
Then-  Ah! Uh!
AHHHH! OH MY GLOOB! No! NoOoOoO! IT'S EVERY PARENT'S WORST NIGHTMARE! NO! No! Noo!  Put that down! Get outta there! Ah, come back! Wait T.V., you're gonna hurt yourself! Charlie, nooooo! Viola, wait!
Hey Lady. These puppies are really wearing me out, you know? I can hardly keep my eyes open.
No, no it's- it's all in the manual you see- it's- it-it's got a fe-
What the- What are you doing?! Let me go!  Hold on, hold on a minute. Just- just lemme- Y'all better watch out!  Puppies?! What are you doing?! Go back inside! The manual's gonna flip!
Jake Jr.! You said your first words! The manual's a buncha junk! ... The manual's a buncha junk? Hmm.
I'm sorry for being such a little stinker kids. Come on and show the old man watcha got!
Whoa! What the-
You did! I'm super proud y'all and I'm duper sorry too.  I've been tryin' to make you know about safety without actually learning about safety the way I did, by not listening to MY mom when that snake jumped out of the policeman's boombox.
Yup! I've been tryin' to make them about safety without actually learning about safety the way I did, by not listening to MY mom when that snake jumped out of the policeman's boombox.
Hey guys. I'm back.
Nah, nah, it's cool. It turns out the pups can pretty much take care of themselves. They don't really need me around.
Yeah. I guess rainicorns age really fast. They're basically like older than me already. Kil Whan has a beard now!
Ah, it's okay! I got a slammin' family right here too!  Plus all my stuff is here.Finn? Finn?! Hey guy, where's my buddy?
Whoa. Alternate-wish-world-Finn is mad uglies!  Hey, I'm mad uglies too!
Everything looks nuts!
What?!
I wish for- a sandwich!
Nah, sandwich is good,  maybe about... this big.... or this big. On ciabatta bread maybe... mmm I don't know, whatever you have is your choice.
Oooh...
Mmm, yeah, ah well, it's Finn's wish. Let's just see how it plays out. I got confidence in my boy!  Besides, I'll hang onto my wish in case i need it.  Awww!
I love you Prismo.
I'm serious man, you're like a strong number three on my 'Cool Guys List.' Ah man, my dad use to make pickles , it's all he use to talk about, he'd obsess about them all the time, when I'd come in from playing he'd be like: Here, Jake, try these!  And they'd be pretty crunchy... actually you'd think they'd be soft but they weren't. I'd be like: Wow dad! You'd made these pretty good!  Yeah, that was dad.
Mm-mm, man your view of relationships is very bleak, don't you get lonely?
Three, two, one... go!
We're three nice dudes, havin' fun! We got warm bubble water, on our buns! I love this spa, and that's a fact! But if I stay too long, I get a pruny back!
Hey man, I'm right here! That's not me man!
Finn! I'm in the spa bath! Oh man!
Make Finn okay! I wish for a safe Finn!
What?
I'm sorry, that's a lot of pressure man...
Oh, okay. Ooo, think... think!
Chaa...
The lipstick!
The Lich's...
Change the Lich's wish!
And go home! Okay, okay, I wish Lich's wish- was for me.
And Finn, to go back home to Ooo!
It worked!
Ha ha! It already happened! And it never happened!
Nothing, cause I saved everybody!
Hmm...
I gotta get that guy a girlfriend.You've got a lot of meat, Wildberry Princess.
Still tastes good.
I'm listening, but I'm gonna keep eating.
Sometimes, I think there's a monster who lives in my stomach, and that's why I'm hungry all the time.
Princess, want me to finish off your pie?  Yes, Jake. All my pies.  Hmm...hehehehehehe, a tiny cat.  Whoa!
You're the assassin!
Well, I'm no princess, sister!
What!? I'd rather be injected with poison!
I mean, I will assassinate Wildberry Princess.
My nose!
Oh, uh, yeah. So, um, Wildberry Princess. So, maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be killed.
I don't know. I'm just thinking out loud here.
Uh, I'm sorry, Wildberry Prin...cess...  You should... let me... do something... and... it will be...good.
Eat this! And that! Ooh, how do you like this, Princess! Duoo!
I'm gonna pick you up now and carry you... to the window!
Wildberry Princess is dead!  Shh...
Oooh!
Finn  help me!
Uhh... Finn, uh, sing mom's lullaby. I'm so tired, Finn, from the meat. Please, you have to lull me to sleep.
I know you carry mom's music box around in your backpack!
Please, pleeeaaase...
Finn there's an assassin in my nose and she poisoned me and is making me kill Wildberry Princess!
Shh!
Shh! Shh! Shh!
Sorry...   Me-mow? Still asleep?
Phew... If I can just grab that antidote...  Ah-ha!
I did it!
Noooooo!!
Hey, everybody, everything's cool...
Right, right, well, we should take her somewhere safer...
I know where to stash you, princess. Follow me.
Here, nobody can take us by surprise. Finn, stand here with your back to the cliff. I'll stay with Wildberry Princess.  To do what must be done.
I...I...I probably shouldn't!
I'm full of poison...
I'm coming--
Dog liver times fifty-one!
Big liver, big liver, yeah!!
Are you naked?
Hehe, we all need a hospital.Hey, dude.
Yeah.
Okay. Just give me a few more months in here and I'll be ready.
Yeah. It's unfortunate we can't enjoy some of these cool things we're passing by, but I guess we could do that the next time we're in the Desert of Wonders, whenever that is!
You are killing me, PB!
I'm glad James is on this trip. Hey, James, thumbs up, buddy!
I wasn't gonna say anything, but yeah. Maybe when we get to know him better, it'll be charming.
Mostly looks like it's just dirt here.
Do it!
Ha ha!
Mnh. Mnh. James, that's not helping!
Dude, I found us some flares! I saved us!
Good Grod! I love you, James!
You know, James, I wasn't sure about you at first, but you're okay.
I take it back.  This guy's totally cuckoo! This is my cuckoo face.
Finn, PB, can I speak to you in the other room, please?!
Hm.
What's up with that James dude?
Wake up. Dude's a saboteur.
You see anything, brudda?
It can't end like this. I got a lady and five kids! I thought I'd outlive at least one of them!
Your lucky coin?
Wha?
I don't know, man.  Here's your coin, James.
Ehh.BMO, what's wrong?
I think he broke his egg.
Hey, BMO, this will cheer ya up!
Well, I'm outta ideas.  What?
Oh, man, James Baxter is so good, man. He always knows just what to say to cheer a guy up!
So good!
Yeah, man, I wanna be like James Baxter, always rollin' in on a beach ball, saying his name in a horse voice, making people smile.  Let's do it!
Jake!
Jake!
Sheesh, tough crowd.
Yeah, man, so unique!
No, it's like, he's shredding on a guitar and learning how to shred isn't just copying the exact notes as someone else's solo. You need to learn how to do your own solo.
Dude, I think we do got something.
Alright, BMO, play the video.
I'll scrub,  you take notes.
BMO, zoom in on my mouth
The Institute of So Und.
Look at this tricked out studio! Half stacks! Full stacks! Oooh, distortion pedals!
These sounds make feel-good, right here.
Yeah, maybe, maybe it could be lower, I don't know.
See that sound? I drew that sound connected to two other sounds.
That's it, the missing thing in our thing!
So we gotta create feel good body actions to go with our feel good sound!
Dude, seriously, I think our thing is gonna change the world. When people experience it, it's going to make them so happy!
Yeah, man, yeah.
Hey, there's the sad girl.
No no no, wait a sec! Reserve judgement until you've see the freshed-up version of our thing.
What's wrong?
Let's just do the thing.
Sorry, I act like a little kitty cat!
Dang, this is real!
Eeeee, he broke my squishy bones!
Finn, when we wake up in the 9th Dead World, promise me you'll listen for this sound
It's just that there are a lot of dead people there, we might get separated. I'll be the one going
Yeah, we know him!!
His name's James Baxter, he just travels around on his beach ball making people happy.It can't end like this.
Yeah, that's like the twenty-fifth time, right?
Totes.
So what? Clone him up, girl.
Come P-Gum, don't be all cold-hearty!
And remember the time James saved PB from that contaminated cupcake?
Jameses!  Alright, who's in charge here?
Explain this biz, James II.
PB ain't gonna like this.
Nah, man. PB's no dummy. She'll find out. It's only a matter of time.
There's Princess Bubblegum!
What a show!
Come on PBs, just sit here with us for five minutes.
Come on! Five minutes!
Mother of Grob!Thanks.
Yup. Mom and dad passed down some pretty good genes.
Well,  it was a day like any other day...
And so they never told me.
I don't know. They never told me. Ha!Like this?
Like this?
Who's it for?
.....It's for... um...
Uh... okay.
Finn! Aw, man, is it really you?
I'm trapped in this dream, and I can't wake up!
Make-out dreams? Nice...
Hey, I won't judge.
Mm-hmm. I don't think she's real.
Just wanted to make sure you were real. Our dreams must be linked for some reason.
Careful! If you grunk up the dreamscape with your subconscious fears, the whole thing'll blow apart!
Just shrink down like me.
'Cuz I sleep a lot.
What did you say??
Help us!
Dad, are you okay?
Yeah...
Yeah, it's nuts! Fast as nuts.
Well... that's kinda boring for me... 'cuz that's my normal power, you know?
Remember, this is just a dream! Keep climbing!
Break it!
Yeah. Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Nope, it's fine.
Nah, it's just dream residue. Forget about it.
Everything's normal.   Everything's norrrmaaaal....
Yeah, mans. Actual Jake.
Ow, man, come on!Lady! Oh, Lady!
...I'M... PUPPIES!?Shelby?
Hmm? Whoa, Shelby! What's going on there? With your butt?
You can chop up a worm and get two? I thought that was a myth.
Ah, it's easy. You just give him something sharp and get him to fight bad guys.
Yeah, you might have to stretch all big if he gets in real trouble. But, yeah.I think the swimming hole's right around the corner!
First one in the water is...um...first one in the water!
Ah! Uh, eh, uh.
Faster, we're getting a swirl!
You ready to get out?
Let's get BMO to make us some sassages. Maybe with that one mustard?  I'll use the Sassage Flare.
Hopefully BMO sees that.
Yeah.
I'm gettin' what?
Grob, dude! You're hat's alive!  This is crazy!  He likes me!
Yeah, man, hats can be anything: pants, other people. It's fine!
Yeah, it's a miracle. Now he can listen to our rad jokes and hang out.
Aw yeah! Aw yeah! BMO! Jakey likes! Look at that spread!
Ha ha! You know it!
Yeah, okay.
Your head looks weird with short hair man, heh, heh, it feels like a peach.
Hey, don't eat thethe food?
Yep.
Quit it!  Gotcha!
BMO hit ya on the butt.
Tsk, it's probably Ice King again, dude. Man, we should tell him we know he sleeps on the top of our house.  Oh.
Gross.
Where is he?!
Ow.
Dude, use your powers!
Just think of something positive! Something comforting!
Uh, yeah. Just think about your mom and use your magic.
Yeah. He deserves to come back good.
Life, man!
Okay. Let's go skin an evil bear.If I hear another peep, there's gonna be trouble! Final warning. Okay, go ahead, BMO.
Okay, welcome back to the program. We're talkin' with our special guest, Finn the Human.
Now, Finn, before the break, you were sayin' somethin' interestingthat you're gettin' outta the romance biz. So, what happened?
And you're not just sayin' that to, uh  make yourself seem more attractive?
Hold on, hold on.  What's that noise?
Can you see who it is?
So, it's goin' pretty good, huh?
What did I tell you?!
Ew.
Hmm!
Wait, I'm coming, too! I'm gonna eat popcorn and make hilarious jokes.  Aw, who ate all my popcorn?
How much farther? This popcorn's not gonna last all day.  Alright, now it might.
Oasis? More like, No way, sis!
You could say I got out of there  in the lick of time. Zing!
This is, like, the opposite of what you wanted.
More like a quick beating! Hey-oh!
Yes. Tank you.Shoosh
We are...
Why does she keep saying that?
Don't worry princess, we're gonna get you out of here.  Whoo-hoo! yeah! yeah!
Trying to get a signal, it's like everyone in Ooo is on their phones or something.  Aww man.
Man, now we have to kick that frog out of his new home.
Finn & Jake-style.
Tah ha, but we punch monsters.
She's dodging the question.
You can go back to the waiting room now, ma'am!
I think we did a good job.
Finn, knights are loyal to their king.
Aa Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba! Loyalty to the King!
Get out of here!
Alright! We did it, dude!
Did this Ice King shave his back or something?
Relax, dude, it's just me.
Heh hee heh. These whiskers would make anyone look like the Ice King.
Pfft, he knows what it is!
Man, these ladies really wanna get married.
Relax dude  just get behind my ear shield.
Awww, haa haa ooo.It's just a jam sesh. Is that what you're gonna jam with?
Pretty good.  I don't think you mastered it yet.
Oh, dude. There's a note.
Hey, guys, I had to run out, but I'll be back, blee-bloo-blop, Don't go in my house.
Yeah. Just Don't go in my house in all caps... written in blood.
Eliminating desire from my heart. It helps pass the time.
No, man, I got a mental block with Cloud Hunt!
Oh, what?! Bring it on, brother! Now explain the rules 'cause I forget.
Got it.
Yes.
She's gonna kill us. Once she finds out she's gonna tie us up and eat us like a spider.
Okay, man. I can do this.  Egh! Egh! Egh!!
Here she comes...
Let's get outta here.
She didn't wash hands!
And this is Finn!
Whatcha doin'?
Brilliant... but how's it gonna work?
Yeah, yeah, awesome, yeah!!
No, nah, nuts!
This is so wrong.
We've crossed the line! I'm gettin' outta here, man!
I dunno, man. Go scope the scene.
What happened, man?
Well... whaddaya mean? What happened?  Bro?
Why are you talking?!
Well, if she's awake, she can definitely hear you talking!
Well, now we're both quietly screaming.
Dude, I think she sees us!
Well, yeah!
So sorry.
What?!
Hmm?  Hey, man, did
AAAAAAH!!What'd you say? Whoa!
Awwww here it comes! Lay it down Finn!
He still cries when he poops. Thanks for being cool guys. Wait up, Finn!  It's comin' from up there!
Yeah, do it Finn! Hit 'im with a boulder! And then hit 'im with another rock!
Whoa. This guy's got problems.
Whoa! What!
But Finn, we're not gonna shut down the roughhouse for real are we?
Thats like math
Aw, man.
Finn this guy seems like a real nut job. You know what I mean? I dont wanna get sucked into this guys hang-ups.
So be it brother.
Maybe you can solve everyone's problems. Like a cherub with its bottom out.
Alright Im gonna-  stay here this time.
Right on man! The marauders are going crazy over the petting! They're petting each other raw! Check em out!
Just promise him anything, hes out of his gourd.
Whoa, dude. Hold on. So this guy wants this and that guy wants that, but man. What do you want?
Wow, thats pretty corny man, but lets do it dude! Wooohoo!
No!
Stop! I've got a problem.
This dolphin fell in love with me!Who is he talking about?
What?! Then why am I running so hard?
She's in trouble!
Hey, wizard, how do you know Marceline?
Oh.
Then what?
But, like, if you know all this, why not just do it yourself?
Did it work?
Me neither. Huh?
Whoa. Whoa!
Hmm... there she is!  Hey, little Marcy.
We're your friends!
Ahem!
Do you know where your memory core is?
Ooo! Ooo! Could be jams and pickles down there!   Weird. I think this door leads to a new memory; with food in it! Ooo, ice cream
Come on, Finn!
Who's this guy supposed to be?
Yo, man, your thing is glowing.
We must be close to the core. I see another door over there. Come on.
This way, Finn! Check out this whacked out memory crack! It's ba-nay-nay down here!
All these orbs must be her memories.
Play hot-cold with your forehead!
Cold. Definitely cold.
Warmer. Warmer, warmer! Whoa, hot. Hot, hot, hot! That must be the one!
Huh?
Oh, no!
Don't worry, Finn! I got the scent.  Ah. Follow me.
I could smell them in there. So what's the plan?
Nice.
No, no, sorry.
Shh, shh, wait!Psshh. Hey, you wanna bump baby lumps?
Yeah.
Now get out of here.
Eh, it's probably just puberty calling.
Ka-psshh.   We snuffed out that trap like champs! Trying to get us up in that cursed arena.
We'd probably have to fight Gladiator Ghosts.
We're back!
That prize kinda stinks. Let's go, Finn. My thighs hurt.
Mmm-hmm. But, hey, if you replace me with a dummy, I could stay down here and dig for lava. Then I'd forge a molten hula-hoop.
Morale, dude, This tomb will be as fun...   As a tropical island, as a tropical island, as a tropical island, as a tropical island.
Check it out, dude.  Ba-duh-buh-da. It's a dirt dummy Jake. Just like in the plan.
Dig-dig-dig-dig-dig-dig-dig. Two gongs? Something crazy's going on up there.  It's me, Jake. Been here the whole time. Huh?
Oh, this is bad.
Finn?
Yeah. I lives. Finn, come with me, man.  Whoa! Dude?
So, how's your side of the plan going?
To escape. I dig and stuff, and you fight to win, 'member?
Ghosts don't got meat.
Hmm... Finn's acting weird. Probably due to a decrease in morale. Gotta get him that lava hula-hoop.
Gotta liven up this unhallowed ground.... for Finn.   On a tropical island, underneath a molten lava moon. Hanging with the hula dancers, asking questions 'cause they got all the answers...
Puttin' on lotion, sittin' by the ocean, rubbin' it on my body, rubbing it on my body...
Get me out of this caa-a-ve, 'cause it's nothing but a gladiator graa-a-ve. And if I stick to the plaa-a-n, I think I'll turn into a lava maa-a-n. I think I'll turn into a lava man!
What about the plan?
You're gonna kill me?
No!
Finn?
No!
What?  Dude, did you...? Was that all fake? Did you act all that out? Was that part of your plan?
So you planned to get all cozy with the Fight King and almost kill me from the get-go?
Why didn't you say so?
That's some funky junk, brother.
Oh, yeah. I bet they're like us. Best bros who got trapped in that arena.Ommmmm...
Don't know. I'm thinking of pillows stuffed with spaghetti.
Neat!
Oh, okay! I'll try!
Billy's big ol' beef fingers!
Me, too!
What is wrong with you?!
Here I go!
This is our first fate-of-the-world deal!
Running this fast makes my stomach hurt!
Whoa!
Punch it in the eye!
Let's blow this stand!
There! Out over the lake!
I'm your dingy dog!
Waaaah!
Then let's go!
It's okay!
He's gettin' his powers back! Weird!
Look out!!  That's it! I'm gonna bark 'im!
Finn!! Buddy!!Uh, yeah, you are, dude.
Huh?
You look like sick, grey meat, but we're gonna jack you up so awesome.
Yeah, man, and then we'll do magic tricks.
Yeah, like  bruh bruh bruh, bruh...
Whoo-oo!
Oh, jeez!!  What's wrong with Princess Bubblegum?!
I know, man, but she just seems... weird.
Uh... Okay, dude.
Oh. Gotcha. I'll go get some tea!
Whoa...  Uh... somethin' weird's goin' on...
AH!
Hey... Princess... Sorry you're not feelin' good.  Oh! I'll sing you a song! You love it when I sing songs!
Uh...  Uh, this song's not that good. It's a bad one. I... I'm stoppin'.  ...And starting a new song!   AAH...
AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!  OH, MY GLOB, OH, MY GLOB, OH, MY GLOB, OH, MY GLOB!!  Maybe the toxic waste did somethin' to her brainmade her have demon powersor somethin!  Yo, dude! Wait! What's all that biz?!
No, man... no... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Wait! Hold on!
Listen... PB's bed was on fire.
She made it on fire.
No, man. With her brain... I think...  Look, man, I'll show you!
Shh!!  P-P-P-Princess...?
I'm lookin' in!
Oh, my glob!
You don't even know, man.
Look!  See it!
Dude! I think we should let the Ice King help! He can freeze her, which could buy us some t
Woooh, do it!
Finn!!
Whoa...Pussy cat! Come here!
Hey!
Help!
Who are these guys? This is a great fight!
I guess that's because I meet Lady Rainicorn every day at four o'clock on the dot. Oh shoot! I'm late!
Aw, man, that sounds awesome! I do want to stay and fight those guys, but I also want to hang out with my girlfriend.
I should probably go. I'll see ya later, buddy.  Finn
Oh!
Sorry! Sorry I'm late. Finn and I were fighting this shark and science cat, and I lost track of time. Anyway, Im here now, M'lady, and I have brought to you half an orange.
Nice! Now make that green!
Ha ha ha! Yeah, that's good.
Sleep! But we were supposed to play viola together!
Yeah. Sorry again for coming so late.
Oh, hey, Shelby.
I'm fed up, Shelby!
Whenever I hang out with Lady Rainicorn, I miss out on fun times with Finn.
And then when I hang out with Finn, I'm missin' out on Lady Rainicorn!  Oh!
And then I won't miss anything! Shelby! My problems are solved.
Ah, isn't this great? This is totally great.  Isn't it?
Isn't it?
She said she also thinks it's great.
Yeah.
Hmm...  Hey, did you know that you both have an awesome sense of humor?
Yeah! Anybody have a joke?
She said, who's there?
. He said diarrhea.
Uh, no. No, she didn't say, diarrhea who? She didn't... say it. Lady, how 'bout you tell a joke?
Uhh... well, the joke doesnt translate very well.
Noooo! Dont leave.  If there was only some way you two could talk to each other directly.  Oh, dude! I just remembered! There's a universal translator device at the bottom of Lake Szelezon!
Yeah, I can't remember why I threw it in there. Let's all go and get it!
Trust me, Finn, shes the Rowdy Queen. She can do anything!
All according to plan.
Here's the translator.  Lets see here.  The voice options are... Old man, nerdy alien, ooor nightmare?  Try sayin' something toots!
Well, at least with old man option we can understand him, I MEAN HER! I mean you sugar!
I remember why I drowned that translator now.
Whoa!
Lady! It's a little rocky in the back seat here!
Laaaadyyy!  Fiiiiinn!  Lady!   Lady! Finn!  Y'all around here?  Dang it!
There you are!  Where were you guys?
Noooo!  I fell off your tail end!  I was shouting your name!
Whoa. That's cool! You got ten of them?
Oh, thats cool.
Yeah! Thanks man!
Yeah, they're awesome.
Hey, Lady, you wanna go play music together or somethin'?
Oh.  Hey Finn. After this next game do you wanna go adventurin' with me?
Humph! Humph Humph Humph!
Mmmm, Nothin'!
No!
I do.
No YOU go ahead!  And YOU have fun with MY girlfriend!
They should be back by now!
Uh, yes, hello. Um, Im lookin' for Finn the Human and Lady Rainicorn.  Hello, can you hear me? Hello.

Yeah, yeah, louder.
Oh, hey guys. I'm just sharing a tender moment with my beautiful friend Tiffany.
Well Im trying to make you both jealous!
Becaaause, Tiffany's a boy!
I guess I'm just jealous of how much you and Finn like each other.
I know. Gaah.
I'm sorry I'm an idiot baby. Forgive me?
You make me feel like I'm huggin' an old man. It's time to get rid of this piece of crud.
Yeah! Waaay better!
I'm sorry I was an idiot. Forgive me?
Let's never be stupid again.I'm tellin' you dude, my pie-dar's goin' 'nay-nays.
Oww!
TT! Where is the pie at?!
Yeah, but what the heck is goin' on here?Happy birthday!
Right! That's because-
No dude, you're blindfolded.
Keep the blindfold on. I've got a surprise for you.
Surprise!
That's not the surprise. This is!
This isn't the gift!
We have to take the train to get to the gift.
I'll go get the tickets.
Heheh. I'm gonna go grab a schedule!
Found a schedule!
Hey man, this is kinda a bad scene. Maybe we should get off the train and huff it to your surprise.
Alright.
Now I know this is going to sound crazy, but what about the conductor?
Oh. Why not?
Whatever, man. I'm gonna go sit and look at the schedule.
Yeeeeeeeaaah?
What?! No way, he was cool and awesome!
Dude, I think you're waaay off.
What'dya think we should do?
Me neither!  Maybe the murderer is just too smart for us.
The conductor's still on the train!
Yay, you did it, you solved it, Finn!
What?! Humpf.
Thank you.
Yup. You were so focused on the murders because you never even noticed!  The skeletons were the hardest part.  It was all an elaborate set up for your birthday present!
Nope! Not unless you count the train's control panel!
Dude, open your eyes!
You deserve it, buddy.  Because you're a great friend.
Nope! That part was a total accident.
Died horribly? Yes. Happy birthday, pal!Uh, 3 minutes. What about you?
What's that? Your invisible watch?
Oh, dang, we were both counting fast.
Do you even need to breathe, Rattleballs?Huh? Oh, Finn, you're awake!
Right. Yeah, I saw that.
Oh, yeah, I think so. Maybe.
Yeah, pretty freaky.  Don't worryouch  they're all hiding.
From me!
It's my birthday, man! Lady Rainicorn put together a elaborate surprise party.
No, but I know Lady Rainicorn. Ouch!  This is totally something she would do. Think about it.
Yes, and they'll only come out if they think we'll be surprised. So we got to act like we're totally unaware, okay?
Just do what I'm doing.  Oh, look at me, living free without a suspicion in the world. Never in my wildest dreams would I guess someone was plannin' a surprise birthday party for me!  Pretty tricky, right?  Come on, let's go back to the hut.
Come on, come on!
I don't know. It didn't take long.
Collect branches for the hobo fire, dude.
Ouchies.
Just gotta char off the rotten partsgood as new, man! Stay vigilant. Eat your protein.
Hmm?
Shhh!  Don't talk so loud! They might hear you!
Noooo!  You'll ruin my surprise party! Oww!
Just promise me, Finn. Promise not to look around.
...my birthday's gonna be rad.
What?
No, man, they'll surprise party me when they're ready. Be patient.
Well, I've been waiting six months!
Everything's gonna be fine, even if we have to wait forever.
Yeah, but don't worry about it, man.
Hmm? Finn?
Noooo! Don't ruin the surprise!
Rah! Ah! Ah!   Noooo!
Surprise!  Happy birthday, Jake! Ow!
This is how my party's gonna go down. Shake it, my friends.  Hey! Hey! Sure is great seeing y'all here. Really makes me think. Ow.   Lady, did you get extra TP for all the potty people?  No.  Well, we might have some party poopers here, and I want to be sure they don't wipe their buns on my cake.
You won't run away?
Finn! Glad I can untie you, buddy.  Check it out! Finn finally made it to my party!
Finn? You lied to me?
What about my party? Don't go! Finn!
Surprise! Surprise!
I did this? Ow.  They've been waiting for me, Finn, for my b-day!
Oof. Yoo-a-hee! I'm a woman! I'm a woman!
Ring, ring!  Eh, hang on, deary.  Hello?  Baby, I told you never to call me here!
Wha... what happened?
What? No. It's not even close to my b-day!  I'm so sorry.
Freak deer!
Finn!
We did it, dude!
Not crazy anymore! How's your legs?
Yeah, like bad breath and eggs.Yeah, yeah, yeah! We're real late! Happy birthday, puppies! Okay, so, putting it out thereI didn't remember to bring you guys any birthday presents, but I did bring lunch!  It's macaroni salad.
Happy birthday, Kim Kil Whan.
Whoa, neat. Um, well, how are things going, Son?
Heh.  I get it.
What?!
But, Son, why?
But, Son, I'm your pop.  What would your mother say, doing this to your poor pip-pop?
Okay, Son, get ready to be glitter-stunned by all this treasuoh, yeah. We spent all of it. All we have left are these vintage photos I got at the flea market. They're interesting!
Hey, Finn, I'm real sorry about this. Somehow, I feel like it's kind of my fault.
You're gonna sleep like that?
I promise I'll work this thi
Hey, buddy, you okay?
I just feel like if we're patient, this whole thing will work itself out before you know it.
See, man? Help is on the way.
Man, don't you know? The laws ain't made to help earthy cats like us.
Nah, man. Listen. Here on our planet, back in the old daysback in the real old daysit was just every man for hisself, scrooblin' and scrat-scrobblin' for the good stuff, the greenest valleys, and scrat-scrobblin'. And the strongest, meanest men got the best stuff. They got the green valleys and were like, The rest of you, y'all scrats get sand. And that's when they made the laws, you see. Once the strong guys got it how they like it, they said, This is fair now. This is the law. Once they were winning, they changed the rules up.
That's awesome!
Hey, Kim Kil Whan! Aw, buddy, I knew you'd come around.  Fathers and sons, man. That's that real thick chowder.   What's this?
Ooh.
Come on, Son, just let me do the...  lah blah blah blah blah.
Man, where did I go wrong?
Yeah, you're right. So, wanna rob a bank or somethin'?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, no, wait! I just remembered I buried a ton of gold in the front yard!
Almost got it.
Hey, Son. I'm glad you're here.
With this!
I know, I know. Kim Kil Whan's a real out-loud flim-flammer, and that's okay, I guess, but why, why, would he do this to his pip-plop-plop?
Ooh, that's it! You're right! If we help him out of his secret jam, he won't need our money anymore. Look, there he goes now. Come on, let's follow him to the mob goons!
Yeah, man, the nose knows.  I smelled him go in there ... and then I smelled him go up there .
Hey, Son!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no. I never even looked for a job.
I was thinkin' about you buying our tree house. I figured out that you don't need our money, so maybe you'd consider my counteroffer...
Father love! I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I lub you, I love you, I love you, I lub you.  Come on, open it!
It's an ocarina. I made it for you.
Whenever you play it, you'll be reminded of your pep-pant's love.
Yeah, it's not hollow. I made the holes with the back end of a pencil.
Okay.
I'll call!
Later, Son!
Yeah, all right! Daddin'!Whoa!
Yeah, and you know the penalty for stealing boots. It's poots... on newts.
Dude, that isn't a lake. That's an ocean.
Poots on newts! Poots on newts!
Poots on newts!
Dude. Dude, did you see me? I was all like womp, and then I was all like take this! Womp! Womp! And then... Hey, whats wrong with you, dude?
Say what, now?
Um... No... I don't really wanna do it.
I'm just messing with you. I'll do it. Hmm... Where to start? Oh, ok. I think we should just take a few steps in the water. You can hold Jake's hand if you're scared.
Um... Oh it's ok, dude. I see the problem. It's just your feet.
Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop.
Boop. Boop.
Hot jam! You're really scared of the ocean. In fact, you're so scared... it gives me an idea. Let's start a business of being scared of the ocean!
Ok. Ok. I have a plan to get rid of your fear. We'll start tomorrow morning.
Fiiiinn. Finn. Hey, Finn. Wake up.
Ready for me to help you get over your ocean fear?
Cool... but I can only do this if you ask me.
Then get ready for my three-step plan. Watch your troubles melt away with step one!
Hey. Hey. Come on. The ocean is your friend, and you got friends all around you right now. Miles and miles of friends.
Don't try to struggle, man.  I'll let you out in a second. You just need to calm down.
That's great. You're doing great. Ready for step two?
Alright, dude. Step... two!
Let it hold you, man! Let it hold you like a child!
Control your breathing!
That means we gotta move to step three. Just don't scream.
I'm gonna push you underwater with my jowls. Just don't scream. Don't scream.
Don't scream. Hold your breath, Finn. You got it, dude!
Finn! Stop it, Finn! Ow!
I think we should give up.
Look, Finn. It's not that I don't want to help you... I just don't wanna get beat up anymore. I mean this  is my bread and butter. I can't have you messing up my bread and butter, dude.
Ok. Fine... but only if you swear not to hit me anymore.
And also swear to only speak in rhymes. Speak in rhymes all the times.
Yes. Perfect. And since you want more... it's time for step four.
I'm not that good at counting.  Come on. Let's go kick your fear of the ocean where the sun don't shine... in the sea cucumber.
Check it, dude. One hundred percent awesome-itude.
You know, it looks way more math if you open up your eyes.
See, man? The ocean is beautiful. There's no reason to be afraid of things that are beautiful.
Hey, look! A black abyss! Let's go check it out... sauerkraut.
Saying, Turn around twice doesn't count as a rhyme, dude.
Hey, you swore!
Ow! My bread and butter!
No, dude! Don't!
Don't worry, dude. Everything's cool. This is the perfect segue into level five.  Here, put this on.
Just make sure you don't pull the emergency tab.
No, dude! I said don't...
Yeah, man. Wait... Finn, you did it! You conquered your fear!
You're at the bottom of the ocean!
Maybe we should celebrate on land.
I'm proud of you man. You did it!
Whoa, dude! What's with your bellybutton?Nice. Little bird family on vacay. Dad's got the mad beautiful tail feathers; Mommy's taking up the rear all plain-jane styles.  Hehe. Glad I get to date a beautiful rainicorn, not some nasty bird.
All lady birds around the whole world are beautiful on the inside?
Fair enough.
Cool, thanks.  Urgent.
Hold still, BMO.
Aw dang. Sorry, BMO.  Cool, man, I'm excited!
What the heck am I looking at?
Jake Jr.?! What's going on here?
What do you want from me?!
Glob it.
The Baker's Shardthe purest source of sugar in the known regions.
BMO, destroy the tape.
Are we on the level, BMO?
I don't want Finn hearing about this.
Oh, hi guys. Were you waiting for me in the dark?
Nah, BMO's covering for me.
I got a job for you guys.  One last score. The Big one.
What? Psssh! Tiffany! I'm the same Jake, I just stopped stealing mostly! 'Cause when you get older you're supposed to get in other stuff, like graphic design, or pottery. It's called growing up!
Dude, you guys on board or what?! You really got something better to do?! I know you don't, Tiffany!
We ain't keeping it.  I'm passing the shard off to a mystery dude.
The dude has my kid.  My Little Jake Jr.
I have the first part.  OK, let's freakin' do this!
OK, do your thing, man.
Not now, Tiffany! Come on!
I did it! For Jake Jr.!
You! Where's my daughter?!
Yeah right, that's super-dumb.
Hang on, sweetie!
You dirty
Shut it, Tiffany!  Gimme my daughter.
Jake Jr.?! WHAT THE PUKE, GIRL?!
What the funky fresh, honey?
That was a long time ago. Before I knew it was wrong!
I am. I couldn't have done that when I was your age.
R-r-r-right. I keep forgetting maths.
Finn and I bust their apples tomorrow. Or maybe the Banana Guards will get 'em.
Come on. I'll take you home now.
I love you, too. Don't stinkin' do this to me again. I'm old and fat. I'll probably have a heart attack.
Wait a minute! You're doing a long con right now, aren't you?
Now I'm really proud of you!Listen, man. One day, I'm probably gonna have half-rainbow pupsters. I gotta be able to share my babies' culture.
Dude, I would love to go on some crazy, made-up adventure with you, but I really gotta read this. So from here on out, I'm just gonna ignore you.
Shhhh!
Finn!  Finn, you butt chicken!
Finn, all the little voices you're doing are cute, but come on, man! Just let me read.
I can feel you pinching me.
Yeah, go play make-believe somewhere else!
Hmm?
AAAAH! AAH!
What did you do to me?! AAAAAAH!
AH! AAAH!
Aaah!
Finn... what's happening?
AAAH! WhatWhat the hecks, man?! What'd you do to me?!
Wha? Who cares, man?! I'm outta here!
Ugh... I was readin' the same paragraph over and over for, like, eleven minutes. I guess I'm gonna give up on learnin' everything about Rainicorn history. Don't tell Lady.
Eh, I'll just fake it.
You makin' that up?
Yeah! Let's do it!Loot, bro!
Looks like a brolicious room to relax in and play video games... bro.
I keep forgetting that he lives here now.
Ice King, we've told you a thousand times: this couch ain't for cuddlin'.
It isn't!
Finn, can I speak to you in the kitchen?
It's time to kick Ice King out!!
Hmmm?
Checking him to a hotel room.
Lumpy Space Princess stays there. That's how cool it is.
Finn, I'm ready to murder the Ice King.
Hahaha! Shut up-up-up-up-up, Abracadeez!
A sexy wizard like you goes where he wants!
What... You do?
Hey, Abadabs!  Why don't you show us that trick you're working on!
You're a good wizard!
This was a great idea, man! It's like he's forgotten all about us!
For good!
How'd they get the other couch down here?
Huh! He's actually not bad!
Yeah...  It's getting pretty late.
Kee Oth Rama P...
I thought he was bluffing.
Scary!
You don't have any other choice! Do it!Yup!
Watch this, everybody! A cooler! With stuff... for the thing!
What about me? What do I focus my energy on, Cinnamon Bun?
Huh?
I thought he was your friend.
Man, I'm sleepy.
Huh? Oh, yeah, right.  Goodnight, homie.
Hrrnf!! Ahh... What?  Alright, alright, you old gut.  Oh, I'm sluggin' it today...  Wake up, Finn. Got a busy day ahead of us. Finn? Hmm. Hmmmmm.
Fiiiinn!!  Fiiiin!! Fiiiin!?!  Man, where is that kid? I'm really startin' to worry...  Take my sammich, BMO. I'm gonna go find Fi   A dancing bug!  Hey, man, you're shakin' it all wrong!
Shhh... Let me show you how it's done!  Aw, yeah! Huh-hah! Yeah! Whoo!
Aaaaah...  Whooooo!  Whoooo! Any more grass shakes, Simon?
Finished, huh?  Finished... Finished... Fin... Fin... Finn...  AWWW, FINN! Darn it! My best friend's missing! I gotta get my head together!  Touching.  Tasting.  Looking.  Little footprints! Too small to be Finn's... More like a bunch-a'-gnomes-carrying-something footprints!
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, NO, IT'S NOT!! Y'all are horrible at tellin' jokes. Lemme hitcha with this. Didya hear about the goblin who got his left arm and left leg cut off?
That's okay! He's all right now!!  AH-HAHAHAHA! AH-HAHAHA! AH-HAHAHAHA!! AH-HAHAHA!!
Yeah!  Yeah!  Man this party is nuts! How'd I even get up here?!
Whoa! Who's the Party God?!
...Oh.
Hahaha!
What do I want most?  ...What do I want most in the world? Well... I wish Finn would stop leavin' his dirty  FIIINN!!!! I was on his trail...! And then I... got distracted...!! GAAAH!! What's wrong with my brain?! Cinnamon Bun was right... I can't focus on NOTHIN'!! Party God, I wish that I could focus on finding my friend Finn!
WAIT, wait... Is there some kinda catch?
Must... find... Finn! Must... must...! PARTY FOREVEEER!!!
PAAAAAAARTAHAAAAAAY!!!  PAAARTAAAY!! STEP BACK, EVERYBODY! I'M GONNA SHAKE IT! UNH! UNH! YOU FEELIN' THIS?!?
HIGH-FIVE!!
LET'S KICK IT!!
HAH-HAH!  I BET I CAN LIFT THIS THING!!  WAAAAHH!!!
I did?!
And you're okay?!
Haha! Then I did it! I saved you by being an unfocused, rowdy party dog!
Hahaha! Yeah!  Let's go eat Cinnamon Bun!Why does he want your crown anyway, Princess?
Wait a second, Princess. Why don't me and Finn just sneak in there incognito and neutralize the threat, old-fashioned spy guy-style?
Okay, I was thinkin' I could  dress up like a mailman.
Yeah, the shadow thing might be pushin' it.
What? But I always wanted to be a mailman.
You ready?
Hello.
Uhh, milkman, sir. I brought the milkfor the hostages, sir.
Yes, sir.  Milk, sir?
Milk?
Milk?
Some milk?
Did you hear that?
Yeah. I can do that.
Milk? Milk?  Milk?  Some milk?
Oh, sure. Sorry, man. I was just trying to get away from that rotten Princess Bubblegum for a while, y'know? Isn't she just the worst?
Oh, yeah, man, she's the worst. Sittin' out there all safe and cozy while I'm riskin' my life tootin' around in here in this stupid milkman costume.
Oh, um... I just mean it feels like a costume... 'cause I wanted to be a mailman so bad, ya see? But the princessshe made me be a milkman anyway.
So what's your story, man? How'd she doodie on you?
Holy shmow, man. That's terrible. That's really terrible. Listen, I
Yeah, but, maybe she didn't realize how much it meant to you.
Whoa, whoa, wait! It doesn't have to be like this! You don't need that crown. You could start over, man. You can start a new kingdomyour own kingdom... where everyone can be whatever they wanna be. I can be the mailman... and you? You can be the princess. And
Yeah, man.
Okay, then. Just sit tight, Princess. I'll get us outta here.  Hey! Hey! I'm comin' out!
Don't worry, Princess. It's okay now. Princess Cookie's gonna go away. You just gotta give him a horse to escape with and he'll go.
No, wait. He said he'd go away forever. Can't we just let him go?
Ah-ah-ah! Man, that horse ain't no good; that's a trap horse.
It's okay, man, I'm Jake. J-J-J-Jingo Jango!
New planI'm gonna help Princess Cookie escape.
No, man, Princess Cookie's a good guy. He just got dealt a bad hand. He's only trying to be what following how his dreams make you want to be, man!
You're either with us or against us.
Hold on tight, Cookie! I'm gonna jump the gorge!
I can make it!
Princess Cookie! Are you all right?
No, everything's gonna be fine. I won't let them put you in the dungeon. Just let me talk to them.
Careful, Princess!
I do?
Princess!
Where's Baby Snaps?
Excuse, me! Your highness!
Oh, hey. Check it out!  Special delivery from the Grass Kingdom!Eeeeeugh...
Haha, gross.
Stop lying! We found your fingerprints at the crime scene!
Uuh... no.
Lady don't take my pizza....
Finn? What's Are you saying Mama? Where'd you
Monster!
Where is she? Oh! I think she's right over...
Your wife's face can't make us faint anymore!
Ouch.
Finally... let's get those princess parts back to the ladies.Your shoe rash is gross, man.  Oh, I'm gonna throw up!  Ah, I'm just kidding!
Don't worry man, we're going to have a ton of fun. We'll eat some melon, I'll get some compliments on my pretty make up.
I look pretty!
Thank you.
I don't like cats, man!
Yes.
Ha ha! Alright!
Huh?! Oh, hey, Gunter. Hey, everybody, Gunter is here!
You won a sea lard, that donks   Ah!!!
Heeey, yooou...Sleds are for suckers. Just ride on my gut.
Switch!
I'm a flying dog!
Yeah, I know what Ice King means: A big nerd!
Come on, brother! We're just trying to beat the heat.
Mmm-hmm!
No, no, you do mean sexy hot.
Uh oh.
Yeah, right, sure.
Well, why'd you capture six of them if you just want to marry one?
Aw, nuts, dude! You broke it when we tried picking the lock to that sad ogre's heart!
Don't worry, Finn. I'll get us out of here with Key Hand! Hah-hah!
I... I'm okay.
Finn!
I'm fine, buddy. Calm down and tend to the princesses.
What are you thinking, Finn?
Sweet plan, dude!
Because they like it here. Because they like you. Because you're a really fun guy!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Finn, what are you doing? Don't dump the Ice King on me!
Oh, eh... Slime Princess, you shouldn't marry Finn. He pees his pants constantly. All the time.Beep beep! Look out! Beep beep! Pillow delivery! Look out buddy!
Sorry buddy,  just trying to cheer you up some. I mean here you are chillin' out with history's coolest friends, building an actual pillow fort, but you just sit there sulking--I mean, what gives!?
That's it?! A joke?
No! Being crazy is hard. You're getting all hung up, all hung up on imaginary problems. You gotta focus on what's real, man.  You see this cup? This is literally my favorite cup.  Now it's gone forever. So it's not real, and I don't care about it anymore.
Finn! Festering is always bad, man! There's no good kind of festering! Finn!
I wonder what Finn's up to...
Uhhh, hey BMO, I gotta snag my mug from you.
Hey don't sweat it, I'll make us some hot chocolate.
You're getting all hung up on imaginary problems, stay with your new wife. You've known her longer now than any of us. You're not even sure if I ever really existed. And I'm pretty sure I didn't look like this.
Well, Rainicorn babies age rapidly. They don't need their parents a couple hours after they're born.
Mmmmm.
Hey buddy, you feeling better already?
Really?
Yeah, that's great man. Now what about this dream?
The dream you were just talking about.
Just a second ago!
The dream you just had in the pillow fort!Heh heh.  Aw, yeah.
Whoa, really?!
Hmmm...  Finn... it's a knife storm!!  It's raining knives, man! Come on!
Looks like we're stayin' in today, kid.
What's on the menu, BMO?
Start it up, BMO!
Yeah, they're cool.
BMO, that was weak.
Ooh, ooh! Dude, I know somethin' totally rockin' we can do!
Let's use our imaginations, man!
Eh. Your loss.  AAAH!!! Lava!! Lava all around us!!  Lava on the floor!
Seriously, man! There must be an enchantment on the house or somethin'!
NOOOOO!!
I was just playin' around with my imagination...  ...and then everything got intense.
Don't imagine blowin' apart my own brain... Don't imagine my eyeballs coming alive and flying around with rocket packs...
I can't! My imagination's too amazing!
I can't, dude... but I think I can imagine an imagination turning-off machine... that is upstairs, surrounded by a crud-load of traps, ghosts, monsters, and poison fountains, and... and... girls. Cute girls, and hamsters.
You can't hold this baby back! That's bad parenting, mamma!
Neat!  Grab that missile.
And... get that cosmic gauntlet.
I'm imagining a wall. You can just go around it.
Oh, there's one now.  Look out!
You're kickin' too high! He's shorter than you!
Alright! You're gettin' him, man!  Uh-oh. Now you're uppercutting his family.  Heh heh heh heh heh! You just kicked his wife in the face!  She's comin' back for revenge.
The knife storm, remember?!?!  Oh, boy... Ooh... Finn, I found some candy.  It tastes like banana candy, man.  Here, man. Try some.
Okay!  It is done.
I can't imagine a riddle.
You exploded the snakes right at us!!
I'm sorry, brother! I'm so sorry!
AAH! A big bowl of baby elephants, chainsaws, and doo-doo's flyin' towards us!! JUMP, DUDE!!  Here come's a soul-eater! Snap its neck!  The Bazooka Goblin has you in its sights!
YEAH!
Alright. Goin' up. My imagination turning-off machine is left of the bed.
Yeah, I mean there's a bunch of cute girls... but they shouldn't bother you.
Cool, man!  Dang, girl. If you weren't a figment of my imagination, I'd want to have your baby.  What're you laughin' at?
Dude... I can't see anything... I must've imagined... an invisible monster!!
I'm comin', buddy! Alright, Invisibo. Eat a piece of this!  Hurry, Finn! Get to the lever!
Hello, Finn. I am awake and healthy.
I do not know what you mean. I am perfectly bombastic.
But Finn, I cannot tell you something amazing as there is nothing amazing happening around us that I could describe for you.
One note is all that is needed.
True. Doth thou not remember shutting down mine imagination?
I am happy that my imagination is gone. It was purposeless.
Aaaah!! I can imagine EVERYTHING!!!
Aw, man... I imagined my mom naked!  Yugh!
I think so. Lemme check. Mmmm... Yup. She's clothed now. And hey, man! It's clear out now! We can go on an adventure!
Huh?!  AAH! AAH! MY LEGS ARE MELTING! Just kidding.I ate all the candy in your backpack, and now I'm sick.
Oh, no. That explains why it didn't taste right.
That's how I feellike a dying parsley. So what's goin' on with the spoon? Marceline and the spoon.
It doesn't look like mu
Oh, my gosh, I feel so much better! Hungry, even. Guys, let's go home!
Let's rock!
Sometimes it's better not to know.
Hey, guys, look what I found!
Yeah!   Heh. Quicksand is pretty fun. Heh.
Okie-doke.
Hmm. Hey, is this whole place made out of sand?
Uh, give me a pull, please.   Stop, you guys are tickling me! Let me try this other thing.  Flesh drill!
Yaah! Rug burn! Ow! Ow!
Aah!  Whoo! It worked! Jake drill worked, you guys.
Check it out! My piggies are free.
Yeah, only half.
Our only exit.
No regre-e-e-ets!  I'm sorry.  This little piggie stayed home, and so should have I. I know! I'll dig us out of here.
Snacks!
I wanna eat snacks... because I am hungry.
Bust, bust, bust!
Uh-oh. I thought they were candy.
Oooh. I'm sorry!
So how hungry are you?
Aah!  I'm sorry. Please don't eat my blood!
Like... how crazy?
And that will keep you from draining my bloods?
Hurry, Finn.
Yo, you know better than that.
Don't go crazy, okay?
Why did you leave me here, dude?
Oh, my Glob. Oh, my Glob, where are you, man? Marcy's wiggin' out!
What?
Okay,  all done now. Nice and snug, right?
What?
You're sick!
C'mon, Jake, think...  It's no good! I need brain food.  Oh, dang, I ate everything!  I'm so hungry! Baby's gonna starve to death! Unless...
I'm cooking up a crazy vampire! That should heat up nice! The sand will keep the meat moist.
You was gonna eat me!
Cook, baby, cook!
Finn!
That's an emerald, dude.
This thing is green.
You're a little colorblind... and there's nothin' to be ashamed of!
I'm sorry you had to push that thing so far.
She was threatening to eat my insides, so I'm cooking her. I know that sounds crazy, but I had no choice.
I'm operating on my lowest survival brain function right now. What?
No, we gotta book!  Go!
Yeah, but watch out for Marceline. She's gone rabid!Hm-huh? Hmm? Oh, yeah...  thanks...
Huh?  Hey!  Now shoo, ya little creeps!  Oh... this is unusual.
Eh... What's with these super penguins?
Well, where is he, then?
Okay, I give up.
Nice ice!
Well, that's great.
I don't knowlemme see.  Whoop!  Dang!
Hold on.  Oh no! NO!
Hold on, man. Wait. Oh, Glob! This can't be happening!
Eh, it's over. We've been conquered.
Everyone.
No, dude! By Gunther.
Whoa, okay.
That's not gonna work.
You're not gonna tell her the plan?
What? I thought you weren't into Bubblegum anymore.
OH MY GOSH! Where is this coming from?!
Jay T. Doggawww, dude! Don't read that book! It's gonna mess up your brain. I keep that book around for laughs. It's all really bad advice.
No, well... you can still be mysteriousthat's fine.
Never mindI didn't say nothin'.
Uhhh...  Oh snap, look out!
Breaking news: that mystery plan of yours is a smash hit.  Because theof the glass... I guess all they care about is bottles, huh.
So, we make them new bottles. Then the Gunthers break the bottles, and then we pick up the glass and make new bottles again?
I like it. I got a rhythm goin'!
Uh, dude? Where have you been?I dunno.
Mayhaps we drank juice of the Elder Toad.
Yeah, right. When did we ever did wrong actions? Get real.
I'm callin' BMO, see if he knows what happened.  Junk... My new camera phone... Wait, c'mere!
I guess I vid-taped a buttload of stuff on here.
Okay, play.
Recording.
Alright, let's do
Battery crunked out.
No, but I guess we're here on purpose?
Look!
Is there an outlet somewhere for this?
Hunson Abadeer?  Alright.
And what's up with this?
Hey! Hey! Is there an outlet anywhere? You guys...
Okay, get on.
I think it's like sentient blood mist.
C'mon, let's see if anyone knows where Hunson Abadeer is.
Okay.
Hey, do you know about this?
That guy stinks.
I... can't. I got nothing to say anymore.
Bloobity bloo bloo blah blee blee blah. Shree shrah...
Hey, check it out. We're at the front of the line.
41 million...  We're next! Whew! Man, I thought I was gonna throw up!
Yaaay!  Nooooooo!
Hey, do you know if there's an outlet anywhere?
Do you know what this is all about?
What's going on, buddy? You givin' up?
You don't wanna just stick it out a little more?
Listen, Finn. Are you listening?
Your heart may be small, but it's strong as a bull donk. And I know. You can wait through this line so we can meet Hunson Abadeer and find out why we're here, and why we're in a pile of banianials, 'cause you're a champ, OK?
Being that you are skilled you can do it!
That's it, champ.  Hehehehe, you're pretty pumped up.
Put your hand down, Finn!
It's not answering questions, man. That thing is gonna bake our beans.
Look.
Ride me, partner.
We just wanna go home, man.
Ah, come on, man!
Finn!
We don't want to hurt you, Abadeer. Just let us go.
Alright, but I'm gonna take a shower first.That paper crane for Princess Bubblegum?
Heh. I bet you wish you were my butt.
I bet you wish you were my butt, because then the princess would... No, wait... I bet you wish you were the Ice King and the princess was my butt!
Hmm...  OH! I bet you wish Bubblegum would kiss you, too! Like the Ice King and my butt! Hahahaha!
Who's ready to party?!
If you wanna dance, just go dance!
Huh, it sounds like you're dealing with some new emotions you don't understand... like jealousy.
Look, man, just go out there and get down!
Do the Science Dance! Remember it? It was sorta like this.  Wah unh we ah eeh...
Yeah! Probably.  Do it, man! You're a pro!
Woof! Man... This is goin' bad. Hey, Finn. You gotta come help me slay these peanut monsters at the bar. It can't wait.  Wow, man, what happened out there?
Yeah. Ladies are twisty, man. Bubblegum's super smart, too.
Why? Is it because his face is so foldy and dramatic?
Maybe what you feel is romantic rivalry.
How?
Lemme see.  I can read their lips.  Hey, shorty, you should pick your boogers and then fart!  You look kind of like a big pink baguette!
Is it? Don't get me wrong. I'm all about stakeouts and spying on this guy, but what if he's not a villain? What if he just looks wicked? Some people look wicked but are super nice.
Hmm.
So... he's recycling... or what?
So I was right! He is a good guy who's just cursed to look suspicious!  You and me, gut! Together forever! Solvin' crimes and makin' up rhymes!
Or good!
Or nice with an evil face?
Yeah, we just wanna know if you're evil or not.
Yeah.  Yes!
Hold up, Finn! The Ice King looks sorta damaged!
Princess Bubblegum!!
I don't wanna watch an old man die on Princess Bubblegum's carpet, man.Wakey, wakey, wake.
Mmm, when you're right you're right.
Um, we were at home last night.
That was a great thing we were doing at home with no other witnesses.
Princess Bubblegum? She's right around the corner. Oh princess Bubblegum!  Yes?  I think some banana guards want to speak with you.
Hey, Root Beer Guy.
You were not supposed to view this tape.
Hey, this looks kinda personal.I'm not talking today
When did you make your sign?
You fancy a wager, buddy?
So, what are the stakes?
Can we use signs?
What's your favorite part?   ... of the breakfast, I mean.
the juice?, the toast?, the jam?.  the Tea?
You didn't write enough signs, did you dummy?
I'm going in there.  Don't touch my signs.
Oh dang, the toast?,
Ow, ow! Okay fine! Uncle uncle, please stop pinching me Bikini Babe!.Whoa!
Yeah!
What you are talking about, Marceline?
Yeah, lay it out, Marcy!
Pretty heavyBMO, turn the music down. BMO! Turn it down!
Come on, BMO you're messing up my game!
Hey, dude, can I borrow that paper?
Bad computer! No! No!  Now go sit in the corner and think about your life.
Ugh!
Hold on!  I got this!  Don't make me use this, man!
I think our house is all jacked up.
Yeah. Okay, let's help him. But he's got to lay off the house.
Lay off the house, man!
I don't know, but you're probably going to say...
Just do whatever you want, man, as long as it comes from the inside.
You keep that stuff inside you, brother. You just got to talk to 'em.
Finn, you see any hot mamas?
Go talk to her!
Go talk to her!
He's got this.
Relax. I got it. Snorlock! Hey, Snorlock. You okay, buddy? Went a little nuts there, guy. You got to get that under control, 'cause you're scaring ladies and jacking up our house.
Aw, who could leave you? Come here, you big hot mess.
Yeah, the ladies.
No, it's not. Check it out, Snorlock. Finn, you be the guy snail, and I'll be...  the chick snail.
Come on, man. We're just pretending. Do it for love.
Well, I'm just sitting here thinking about mating with snails.
We're just role-playing, buddy.
Here, Finn. This time you be the chick and I'll be the snail dude.
Hey, baby. What's up?
Mm-mmm!  mm-mmm!  Girl, you smell good. Did you take a bath in rainbows and cupcakes?
Say yes!  Say Yes!  Say YES!  Say Yes!
See, Snorlock? Talking to ladies is easy. Just act like me.
Aw, it's okay, buddy. Come here and give us a hug.
Stay focused, Snorlock. You have any cool talents that ladies might like?
Umm, hey, Finn, teach him how to use swords. The princesses always love this one.
Do you think you can do that, Snorlock?
Hmm. Maybe you're musical. Can you do this?  Try doin' all that.
Yeah, Snorlock! Show us that talent!
Let's just let Snorlock do his thing. Go to it, buddy!
Look at him go! Bringing in the ladies.
Wedge, dude!
It's no use, man. It's stuck with snail slime.
Finn! Aah!
Dude, I'm going in.
Hmph!
Snorlock, I'm gonna give you till the count of three, mister!
One, two, three!
Fine. I didn't want to have to do this.
Snorlock, you never a shell? That means you're not naked. You're a slug!
I don't know why they have to make out so close to our house.
Yeah. You live here, too!Yeah, you think you're pretty way up there but I can get you!
Whoa!
Dude, what's up?
Whooo!
Tell me about what, dude?
Alright, what's going on?
Hey, dude. I think you and Bubblegum are up to something.
Whoa, you guys are up to something. Is it some sort of prank? Can I get in on it?
Hmm...
Hey seriously, man. I'm your bro. Bros are supposed to tell bros everything all the time. What are you and Bubblegum up to? Is everything alright?
Truth.
I can't eat chocolate or fudge 'cause I'm a dog and they'd probably kill me, but hmmmmm probably... neither. Finn! Truth or dare?
I dare you... to tell me the truth about what's going on in your mind. What were you and Bubblegum talking about when you were alone together?
I'm not playing dodge socks 'til you stop dodging my questions. Hey...  Old Mr. Cream Puff? Isn't he dead?
Whoa.  Look dude, just tell me what's up, 'cause you are crazier than a cannonball tonight.
What? You lost me.
Adventure time?
Really?
Okay, okay, alright.  But in seven minutes, I'm gonna come out and make you spill your beans, Finn.
Whew!
Seven minutes up yet?  Whoa!  What the nuts happened here?!
Really!?
This is messed up, but sweet.
Starchie!
Man, you broke a Royal Promise? You're nuts. All you had to do is say that it was a royal secret. I know what's up.It's an ugly scene, man.
Whoa!Wait, wait!  Shh, shh, shh! Shush!
You hear that?  It was totally silent for, like, a whole second!
Sometimes, we get so wrapped up battling stuff, we forget the...Ooomph!
Are you guys talking to me?
Well, you guys are missing some important details. I'm Jake the Dog! Listen!  Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!
Yeah, that's true, except I'm not Magic Man!
Whoa. That second one sounds pretty cool. I mean, yeah. I'm way into that. Except...oh...I would really miss my best friend. His name is Finn, and I think it would mess him up if I wasn't around.
Yeah.
Huh? Hey, I'm alive!
He said his new prison is shame.I'm staring because I can't move my head.
No, really, I can't move.
What's happening?!
Hey! Who is that?
Ooooh...  Ice King!
So why can't we move?
Why are you doing this, Ice King?
You tried to kill us, like, four times.
Just unfreeze us now, man.
Mm-hmm.
Um, ooh, uh... rainbow?
Wha?
Don't touch my lemons, Ice King! Ice King!
Gunter! No, Gunter! No!
No! Gunter! No!
What're we gonna do?!
What?
Noooo! No, no, no, no, no!
I can't take this any more! Dang it, Finn! What are you doing in there?
Key! Gunter. Gunter. Psst! Pssssst. Come here, Gunter.
Grab it, Gunter. Pick it up!  Pick it up!!  What are you waiting for? Just grab it!
Gunter! Come back.
Gunter. Gunter, wake up.  Go... get... the... key.  Consarn it, Gunter!
Wait, you're sleeping up here?!
Uh, yeah, my girlfriend? Lady Rainicorn?
You don't say.
What?  He fell asleep with his eyes open. Finn! Finn, snap out of it!
I'm hungry.
That sounds pretty good, actually.
Dude, you're back!
Where's your Astral Beast?
What kind of beast?
A gorilla, huh?
Hey, come on now, you're not the worst.
No, you're not! You're the best!
I'm using my enhanced brain sense to tell your astral beast to slap some sense into you.
No... you... don't!Blankie me. Blankie me, Finn!
Right here.
Because I'm sick!
Too hot!  URGGH!
Soup me, Finny.
Yes.  Tell me a story...
No! I already heard that story before.
Make me a new one, Finn. A new story.
Nooo!
I don't want a made-up story. I need a real story.
Oh my gosh! What is it?
Spit it out.
Oh no, now I feel a thousand times worse. Finn, a story's gotta have excitement, romance...  ...suspense,  and it has to have a happy ending.
That's okay, buddy. Just dig me a hole and -- actually, two holes. One for my guts and one for my face, 'cause when I die, my guts are gonna blow outta my face.
Then go get me that story.  And make sure it has all the stuff on this list.
And then what happened?
Huuuuuuuuh!!!
That was...  perfect! I feel a million times better!
Yeah! The romance stopped my fever... the suspense cured my headache... and everything else cured everything else! I'm not sick, I'm not sick!
Finn, c'mon! Dance the health dance with me.
You allergic to my health dance?
Ohhhh... Finn, did you catch my sick?
Well, I know just how to make you feel better...blankie...  ...rubbie...  and best of all, a good story. Once upon a time...
The end.Yeah, man, it'll be fun!  Toss the Jake-sploder!  Nyeeeeh, boom!
Again, man!
Ow!! Whoa... I don't think this is a stump.
A hatch?  We should check it out, ya think?!   Waaah!
What a dump!  Can you imagine the jerks that musta lived here?
We could rule them... like gods!  ...Angry gods...
Shh. They're startled. Ya gotta be gentle with wild animals.
I don't know, man. Maybe they just don't know any other thing.
Well, let's bring 'er up!
Ooooh! Mah back!!
Oop. Ya killed 'er.
Yep. Felled by surface-world germs.  Heh. Just kiddin'.
Patience...
That's just a rock.  A low-level enemy.
Golden as a wheaty sunset! How's yours?
Heh. That's adorable. Hup!
Dang... She is way into candy.
You know, she may be too excited about candy.
So now what? Fight the humans to the death when they attack?
They're doomed.
Ahh, these candy weapons are too cute to be scary.
Aw, so cute! I just wanna give them candy!
I don't think that'll scare anybody...
Hey, buddy! We did it! Finn? You okay?
We're all wild animals, brother.Yeah!
Nah, it's a Snow Golem, man. I think he's laughing.
Oh, yeah, big time.
Yup.Here we go. They're probably gonna try to lure us on some dumb trip.
Oh.And if I do this hand position,  my boogers should turn into smoke bombs.
Relax, Restless Pants. A true ninja can sense the intentions of his enemies.  Jin.
Yep, ever since we fished this ninja manual out of a ditch. Finn, booty me!
Finn, I think I'm gonna take off my booties. I can't flip these pages.
Uh-oh. If the Ice King's so happy, he must have stolen a princess when we weren't looking, somehow.  That's ninja logic.
You got it, shino-bro! Ninja kick!
Princess?
Princess? ...Ahh...
No princess here, man.
Nothing is trapped, dude. We can't find any captured princesses, because the Ice King hasn't captured one yet. He's out doin' it right now.
No. It's only a ninja hunch, so we should ninja snoop for proof.
Whoo! Got the Ice King's diary.
And yet we must.  Dear diaryand you better write me back this time!  today I'm bringing home a special new cutie.
Or... we could keep looking through his stuff. Heh, heh, heh! You know, for more proof? Hehehe!
Where are we gonna hide?
Nah. Hey, Finn, I don't want to hide in the hamper anymore; it reeks in here.
Nah, man. My sense of smell is, like, one thousand times better than yours. Also, the hamper's boring. I'm out.
I'm out!
Check this out!
I want to draw something.
I'll delete it after!
What kind of guy builds a cave inside of another a cave?  What's this? A spellbook?  Whoo!
Ah, it's too late for that.
What'cha got there?
I ain't even heard of these techniques.  Ee-oy-nee-noy-ee-oy-nee-noy-numb-chucks!
Yeah, so?
Nah, they're still cool. But Ice King's still lame because he hides his ninja love. We wear our ninja on our sleeves!
Fridjitsu master Jake summons... stars of frozen rain.  Get ready to be... star struck.
Hyah!
Icicle kick!
Flying jump!
Heh! Fridjitsu master Jake summons... arrow of ice!
Hai!
Thin ice, thin ice, thin ice!
Ooh, right.
Yeah, the one you just came back from stealin'.
Gunther's a woman?!
A couple of ninjas like me and Finn can only be defeated by another ninja!This stinks! Hey, how much longer till we get to the mysterious party?
What's it say?
I'm Randy Butternubs.
Tut-tut, Lumpy Space Princess! What would your boyfriend Brad say?
No.
Yeaaaaah, right.
Come on. You don't remember when I pulled the same trick on your birthday?  I used the fake skeletons.  To make you think everyone was dead.
Classic move.
What do you mean Hmmm?
Let's find some candles. If the lights go out again, we'll be able to catch the murderer!
Okay.
Lay truth on me BMO, is Finn pulling some elaborate prank on me?
Ooh!  Thanks, BMO! BMO?
BMO?
AHHH!  Oh my crease! Oh my crease! Assemble! Reassemble! Come on you guys!
The ghost got 'im!
It sounds like she's in there!
Chill out, girl.  You find any candles upstairs?
Well, I dropped a lighter downstairs, but there's no way I'm going back for that.
Someone at this table isn't who they appear to be!
A half-orc shaman.
Why did you break up with Brad? Only the real LSP would know that!
You're right. I'm just feeling gossipy and I wanna know what happened.
You're not PB! Tie you up!
Aha!  I knew you were pranking me back, you!
Look!   I'm scared, bro.
RUN, HOMIE, RUN!
It won't open!
Okay...
Ow, ow, ow! I got a splinter!
Don't let go, man!
Haha! Gotcha, dude! Two for two!
I figured out your plan months ago! So I flipped the script. Oh yeah!
Yeah, see?!
The what?
Eh, nah. You must have been so scared you imagined that part.
Haha, nice try, Finn. Let's get outta here.Here, try throwing this one.
Here's one called Caturday Surprise.
I have no idea. But it's probably best to stay out of it.
Uh-oh...
Oh boy. I'm sorry! I can't stop now.
Two witnesses!
Heheh. She's completely bonkers.
Don't worry!  That won't happen. We're gonna catch that Duke!
Dude, look. The Duke of Nuts is bad guys.
Think about it. If Bubblegum hates him so much, then he must have done some rotten stuff. I mean, maybe he even threw a bottle and turned someone ugly before.
Maybe I am!
Nah, we're more like cops. Crooked cops!
How are you?
Oh... should've asked if these were, like, her eggs or something.
Woah!
What?! You believe that? She is nuts. Listen, man. Let's just go back and face the music. Who cares if Bubblegum hates you forever? It's no biggie. Tons of people hate me!
I went left too!
Dude. That's not him.
That's the Duke of Nuts.
Just because he's a good father, doesn't necessarily mean he isn't a villain.
I can probably think of a reason why that's villainous if you gave me enough time. Maybe.
Hey man, it's not that bad being hated.
What happened to the cup?
Rustle. Rustle, rustle.  I'm an ambush! Halt!
Oh,  Did I come out to early?
I've come for the princess. I'm an assassin!
Hi-yah!
I will kill you! And raise your children as my own!
Hah!
Sorry, dude!  Now, to kill you up. But wait, surely this cannot be the fair Princess Bubblegum! Where are her pink, flush cheeks? The long gooey hair?  Clearly, the princess travels elsewhere.  Later, Bubblegum!  Get out there, man!
Go, go, go, go!
Yeah, alright!
Buy a lady a drink?
...nope.I know, Finn! I know!
Aaaaadventure time?
Enchiridion is...  That way.
It's in the castle on top of the mountain.  In a room.  Wish you had one, huh?
What about the book?
Yo, Finn. Are you alright? Did you get brain damage?
Hey! Back off, you gnomes! That kid just saved you guys! You should thank him, not destroy old ladies! Do you even know what I'm talking about? Say thank you! Say... Thank... You.
Get back in there!
Hey, Finn. You okay?
Awww. Don't let those gnomes and their illusions get you down. They're just gnomes and illusions.
Yeah, man. Think. What would regular, old, sweet ladies be doing wandering the hills of Mount Cragdor?
No way. This place is designed to mess you up. To mess with your head. None of this is real. It's all just trials to test your heroic attributes.
Now let's go get that book.
It's ok, Finn! I can get out!
Don't worry, dude! I found another wayoof!
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa-oa!
Stomachs are weird.
Dude! You just flew us all the way to the top! Wait a minute.  I can smell the book right through this door.
You know what that was? That was righteous.
You got it!
Hey! Crack open that book and read something for fun's sake, alright?
Whoa. What'd you just read?Dude, we've been up for like seven days.
Yeah, for real-sies!  Remember? First, we rescued the Slime Princess from the Ghost Ship Vortex. And then we slayed that fire dragon. And that took a couple of days.
Helped Peppermint Butler with his Goblin problem.
Then, we captured that Bandito.
Saved the house...
And fed that duck.
We've had a busy week.
Good night, buddy.
Yeah?
No.
Yeah, what's going on with that?
Man, I just wanna go to sleep.
Not gonna be able to sleep with that horse watchin' me.
Outta sight and outta mind.
See 'ya in the morning, pal.
All right, man. Let's just go...push it off that hill or something.
Hey! Get out of here, horse! I want to go to sleep, and you're creeping me the math out!
Forget it, man. This horse is whack. It's got poo-brain.
I'm super-pulling!
I didn't wanna have to use my powers on you, horse, because I'm so sleepy. But you've pushed Jake too far!
Let's get back to bed, buddy.
I wanna marry my bed.
No more.... NO MORE!
I have an idea!  I did it! Ha-ha! He can't stare at us if he's blind!
Wh..why?! Stupid blindfold! What's your deal, screwy?! Why are you messin' with us, huh?!
Yeah, I know, Finn. I diagnosed this horse with whacked out poo-brain five minutes ago.
That's true! You're a genius!  All right horse, prepare to be lured!  Follow me, Horsey.
Huh! Hmmm.  So, Beethoven's not luring enough for you, is it? Well, how about some Mozart?!
Huh? Oh, nuts. Let me try and lure a mongoose!
No! Ahh!  Dude... let's kill the horse.
I'm so tired, Finn!
Okay, we won't kill the horse. We'll dress him up like a bunny! Ha-ha! And get a giant hawkCaaaww!--To kill him!
Caaawww! Caaawwwwww!
Eh. Did I say that the hawk would kill him? I meant that the hawk would swoop down gently and take him away to an island of sunshine and love-stuff and, take care of him.
What do think?
Grab a good hold and fly away!
Good night, buddy.
That's obvious, Finn! You don't have to say that out loud!
You're just mad at me for being...handsome? Well, you're the one who told me to lure snakes! Ahhh!
Aw, man.. you're right! We have to get rid of this horse, for us!
Oh, Finn; this horse is bringing us together now. This horse is a blessing.
You...wait, wait.  The horse is tearing us apart again!
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?!
Oh, my Grod!
He was trying to learn our bedtime secrets!
He was! Did you find out that I sleep in the nude?
It's none of your business how nude I sleep, Ice King! Nnnnone of your business!
Here's your sword, dude!
Tell us why you were spying!
Quick! Throw them to the Ice King!
He's using his ice powers.
Yeah and make it quick 'cause we're both really sleepy.
Huh?
So, you dressed up like a horse?C'mon, let's go look for that creep!
So, you got some sleek new shades, and now everything's different?
You smell with your beard?
Lame.
I know! I almost told him 'cause it was driving me nuts!
Do you think he's got evil intentions behind his reborn star-child act?
Yeah, me too.
Aw, hey, that's cute.
Hmm.
This one's a letter from the hospital.
Yeah, I learned braille from my ex.
Nah, just cool.  Dear Xergiok, thank you so much for your donation. The kidneys fit great.  Well, geez, maybe he has changed his ways!
Shush, child!
Finn! What are you doing, man?
Are you sure?
Alright, tell him.
Your eyes weren't stolen by a wizard. They're in your beard.
Sure, okay.
You were in the desert a long time, man.
Nah, it was more like one year and change, dude.
Whisper Dan.
Uh, wait. Xergiok, this is the Goblin Kingdom.
Oh, dang!
You lost your friends, dude.
Are you gonna be alright, man?
Nah, man, he's fine.I don't know... I'm getting bit up by something.
I said it might be good. It's not, though.
Wanna just go?
Oh, whoa!
Bleehhh! Aw! Ehhh!
Whoa, relax, buddy! You're talkin' to the right couple of guys.
That's nice! Thanks, man.
Hmm.
Yeah, but it's hard to make out. Could just be some footprints... or an old doodie.
Yeah, that's a great idea, man. I was just gonna throw 'em all on the ground anyway.  Whomp.  Whomp.  Whomp.  Whomp.  This way.  The thing with frogs is they got a real subtle smell. Kinda like when you open up a new thing of, um... CDRs.
Yeah... but subtler.  Mm-HMM! Just as I suspected.
Oh, yeah.
Word.  Wait, these prints are all messed up!
We ran out of those a while ago.
What? Nah, man! Frogs are mighty dumb, you know that. He's probably runnin' around like that 'cause he's lost!  Plus, we're not even lost. I just gotta stretch up past these trees and see where we're at.  Dang. It's all misty! It's kinda nice up here, though.  AAAAAAAAH! Man, forget that! I can't see anything through that mist. Plus, I got struck by lightning. We're just gonna have to set up camp and wait out the storm.
Yeah, me, too!
Do you remember how to make a fire with sticks?
Oh, yeah.
I don't think it's workin', man.
That's not it. I think you're on to something, though.
Come on, boys, come on!
You just gotta get some momentum going.  AAAAAAH! Glob-globbing stick! Glob-globbing swamp!  AAAAAAAAAAAAH!  Oh, hey, you got the fire goin'. Right on!
I don't know, but let's pound him while he's vulnerable.
Whoaa!
Ow, my head hurts.
Oh, what?!  Yeah, . Hey, whoa! That gives me a great idea. We can make a Finn and Jake out of sticks and stuff and lure the Mega Frog out here, then ba-donk him right while he's all confused!
Fuh-fuh-fuh... fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh...
FUH-FUH-FUH-FROOOOOOG!!
Finn, that is gross, man! Don't use language like that.
Chomp that!
Aaaah! He's eating me! Aah! Gently eating me! No teeth! Mostly tongue!
Oof! Sick, dude!  Huh?Ooo!
What's that?
Woo!
Yeah?
Oh, yeah? What's that?
Hey, how can you sing like that, dude?
Oh, yeah.
Seriously, Stanley. For a watermelon you get into trouble way more often than you should.
W-whoa!
That... is the most adorable thing I have ever seen. And he loves your baby song. Sing some more of it, dude.
Keep it going, man!
Yeah!
I've got that on my back. I call it my butt.
Whoa!
Little baby feet!
What are you doing?
Enough hygiene.  Let's get to it!
Mornin'.
Yeah, ok.
Over there.
Slam-a-cow! That fool looks rumped.
Well, look at him. He's all limp... and weird.
He doesn't want to drink that goop, man.
You mean the grapes?
That doesn't sound good.
Uh, you think we... think we fed the wrong hole?
No way!
Holy fig, that's awesome! What food are you drawing now?
Well, don't feed it me!
No!
Ahhh! Keep it away! Shoo! Shoo!
Dude! You eating me is just as bad as the Jiggler eating me.
Yes. If that is what must be done.
I taste awesome.
I'll get the tunes!
Yeah, Jiggler. Go nuts! Go nuts like there's bugs on your butts!
Whoa!
What the heck? What's wrong with him?
Oh, man...
All I could find was your glass eye collection!
Aw, man. They're in mint condition.
Alright! Coming!
One... more... patch!  Finished. Ugh. He looks terrible. Finn, I know you don't want to hear this, but I think we should cut our losses and bring this fella back to where we found him.
Oh... Finn. Ok... Our pet exploded.
Maybe we can... scrape him up! And... eyuhh...
And the cupboards!
I wonder... Where's his heinie?
Found it! Come here, you!
Hey!
Ok.
Got him!
Well, at least he's all in one piece.
Sheesh. You think he's dead?
Finn. Stop it, man. What are you doing?
Just put him down.
I think he's trying to tell us something. Finn, this looks like it could be his Mama Jiggler
Look... Chill out, ok? We can fix this. Check it out.  His mom looks like she's out by Stanley's house... where we found the Jiggler. If we get him back to her, she'll be able to fix him up!
Did you hear that? Whistling!
Look! The little guy wants to go home!
Be well.
He feels cold.
Huh?
Oh, man!
Finn! I figured it out, dude. It's the juice. The Jiggler needs to smell like its mama's juice. That's how wild animals know whats going on... and this guy right here is all drained out. We gotta toss it in the soup, brother.
You said it! That was a nightmare.You alright, buddy? Another nightmare?
Whoa, the Cosmic Owl? What if that was a premonition dream, Finn?
Could be... We better go tell Billy about it just in case. He'll know what to do.
I dreamed I was in kindergarten again, but I had really big feet and was also the teacher.
Come on! We better hurry!
BILLY!!! WAKE UP!!!!
We came to see if you were dead!
Cool!
You sure that's a gem?
Gross....
Man, we got so many gems, it's crazy! Hey Billy, how many gems we still need to get? Two? One?
Wait... Two? Or One?
Hmm...
Ooooooohhhhhhh!
Cool!
Enhance!
Whoa... Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm...MAKE IT STOP!
Let's go get that gem!Dude! Shooting star! Make a wish!
Oh, you know. That something special only two bros can share.
You mean the...
Oh, man I wanna ride it so bad!
You can't control it dude. You have to let it give you control.
Start wishin'!
Yoga balls aren't that really huge, dude.
Should we like, try to cheat and stretch over the walls?
Okay, well... then... I'll just hook my legs around this stump and stretch us through so we don't get lost. Like this, see?
Thank you.
Nah, we're here to save you, guy!
This is our chance!
Hold on boys, we're gonna get us some wishes!
Choo-choo.
Yeah, I got a nice bod!
Okay, well you can take your weird body issues and tuck them somewhere private. Where I can take my healthy body issues... and  FIGHT A GOLEM!
I'm on it!
Stop flexing. I can't... stretch.... any more.
Come on baby.
Golem... taken care of... dudes.
Hehe.  Alright. Come on, Finn. The stretching train is leaving the station. Choo-choo.
Just gotta keep stretchin'.
No.
Whoa! Check that out!
Hmm.
Hey, man. Watch it. I think that's my nerp, but like super stretched out.
Stop man!
NERP!
I got it!
Owowowowowowowowow.
I'm good, man. It's the small scorpions you gotta worry about. Or is that just with snakes?  Oop, nope, wait, poison's kickin' in.
Alright, you guys, hop on!  Let's do it.
I'm fine, brother. We'll have that war elephant in no time!
Yes.
Huh, yeah, I just... can't close my eyes... lids... too tight.
Yeah... I'm feeling a little thin.
Ah, alright.
I'm goin' for it!
Done!
Gotta move carefully. My internal organs are super stretched, I'm paper thin!
Ow! Ooh!
My insides are all mashes up!
You were right. I pushed myself too far. I'll never fall victim to peer pressure again!
Actually, I'll do anything you guys want if you say my name three times.
Here we go!  Ooh.
But I'm too weak!
Yeaargh! That's it, I'm dead.
Nah.
Huh?
Right. So hard to think on an empty stomach. I wish I wasn't so hungry.
I know. You should wish for the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant. It's what we wanted.
Do it... for... me!
Yes!
It has to give you control! Remember!
Yeah, boyyy!Mmhmm! This is gonna be easy as... uh... mm...
Yeah, okay.
Where's your village?
Sammiches!
Be alert. Anything could pop out of there and rip our faces off.
Be careful, Finn.
It's you!
LSP, what the heck are you doin' here?
Whaaaaat?
Oh, and then you found this windmill.
Yeah, that'll work.
Yeah, you could just let her go.
Yeah, we didn't really do that much.Finn, oh my grosh, Finn! It was amazing!
I had a croak dream, Finn! My croak dream!
Mhmm!
Yeah man!  There was a rocket ship , you weren't there , and there was a Banana Man  and I ran out of air and in outer space  and isn't that great Finn!
Aww, come on Finn  There's nothing to worry about! Think about it, I don't know any Banana Man Finn and rocket ships haven't been reinvented yet! I'll probably live another hundred years, easy.
Someones downstairs.
Who is it?
What do we do?
Is he still out there?
Phew, see I told you today wasn't the day! Hey, you wanna make an ice cream pizza?
Finn,  when I die my individual earth conscious is gonna go all everywhere while glob tallies my deeds!
I'm gonna be all around you!  In your nose, in your dreams and socks, I'll be a part of you in your earth mind!  It's gonna be great!
No one can change your croak dream, Finn, not even you.
Why?
No man, he's walking into his house! .
Finn, did you eat your breakfast?
Because you forgot how the sun works. The sun is actually far away, it's not just sitting on the horizon.
You gotta eat your breakfast man, eat the protein. Helps your brain.
Whoa, just like in my dream!
Dude, just except it!
What are you doing man?  Ahh!!
Ahh!
Wait, you're not gonna kill him, are you?!
Careful man, I want to be alive for my croak!
Dude, I appreciate why your doing this, but you're not gonna stop from transcend in to Glob world!
Huh?
The rocket from my croak dream! Oh man, I guess this is it. I've got to embrace this today!
You can't stop deatheny, Finn!
Huh? No man!
Yeyuh!
Banana Man get your butt on board, we've got a date with destiny!
Get off you cant mess with fate
Finn
Finn.
Finn, let me go.
You have to let me go.
Destiny!!
Take care brother you weren't by my side in the croak dream but I'm glad you're here to see me off
See you on the other side!
Huh? Whaaa?
Am I in glob world?
Fiiiiiiinnn, don't try to stop me, Finn!
Thanks man, I knew you'd come around.
Take it easy there, buddy.
Poor Banana Man. So I guess that wasn't a real croak dream after all! It didn't really come together quite right.
Hey no wait, in the croak dream it was me and Banana Man,  but this time you were here too.  So...  it must be destined to happen again when your not around!
Hmm?  What are you doing?
Get off of me!
No!
No, c'mon!
I know you're not a ghost Finn, stop chasing me!He's magnificent!
Yep.
All right, let's hit it.
Bye! Goodbye!
Heh, that was fun, but why'd you do it?
I guess this is it.
Yeah, man, mostly just looks empty. I mean, what thief would ever hang out here? There's nothing to steal!
True, true. This place is perfect for toting tarts.
Heheheh, yeah. Ohh, wait! Hold up!
Shh.  It's a campfireclose by.
Maybe.
What? Whatcha sayin'?
I think they're just dirty hobos.
Why?
Oh, yeah.
Rawr!
Uh-oh, man, he got, like, five or six!
They're radical! No tart problems here!
I think the plan went awry.
Oh, yeah, and who knows what kind of freaky things would have happened if we took the Royal Tart Path?  Heheh, old Cinnamon Bun's probably got his hands full.
Huh? How?
So no thieves!
You are on a roll today, buddy!
Yeah, P.U.!
Yeah?
Uh, just now?
No.
Hmm. Hey, Finn?
Did you just, uh, lick meall the way up my arm?
Hmm. Strange.
Uh-oh! Man, we got got! There's only two left!
Whoa, whoa, take it easy, buddy. We've still got two whole tarts left. PB is gonna be fine.
Yeah, why not?
Finn, he's got a laser gun!
Mmm, yeahor... we could smash in there and stop Congress from chopping her head off.
And there's Cinnamon Bun over there!
Psht! Whatever, man. Heh heh.Yo, guys! You gotta do something! That's my best friend in there!  You okay in there?
I know! It's called...  And it is deadly.
Ha-a.
Of course I am! See these tears of worry?
Hey, why don't you guys team up and fight each other to see who gets to wear the crown.
Man, this is intense. I better do something!
They devolved into beasts. It has hilarious.What? My butt? Weird. Where are we?
Ouch!
Hmm.
Hmm. Not that great. I feel weird in my skin.
Yeah... but I could get used to this.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Broke up dimension, you're breakin' my heart. I'm lookin' for broke-up girl to break me apart.  Just kiddin'. I got a girl!  Lady Rainicorn, yeah! Hmm, that don't look right.  That's better.
Hmm?
Oh my fun. I thought you was a rock.
Whoops!  Sorry.
Cool. You wanna be friends?
Whoa. Seriously?
Hello?  I'm just gonna pretend you're sleeping.
Hey, Lady. You asked me to make you a video.
...saying JTD won't change his doggy ways.
Okay, I love you girl. I hope you liked it. Bye!
Okay, this is scene one and take one of Heat Signature 2. Ready? Action!
No!
Hmm, guess what, Lady? This dirt dog needs a bath!
Wawoo!
What'a mean?
Uh, what? That's my dad, Joshua, back in the old days.
I'm his son, dude.
He's dead, dude. Don't make me get emotional about it.
Okay, that's weird.
You want to get beat up? That's weird. I'm not doin' your weird biz.
Nope.
What the!
I'm Jay T.the Dog. I'm Jake.
Whoa, lady, no way. This boy's got.
I like the way you talk, but you are crazy.
No, girl, we can bounce outta here. My friend Finn will save us any second now.
Well, I guess we're gonna have to fight then.
Finn, yes! Help me!
This isn't huggingit's fighting! Fighting!
No, that is not correct!
My blood! Woo!
Woop! Hey, hey! Lady!
Samantha, you can come too, I guess.
You made an oath. Okay.
Nah, I'll just stretch into a tree.
Pshh, please! Not even.
Uh, because... Kee-Oth was right there! An-and there were traps! I didn't have no blood this whole time, so I'm totally out of it.
Woo...Sorry, I got a little light-headed.
I love you too, Lady.
Okay, big hug!I know what the Ice Cream Marathon is.  I've been training for weeks. And I am determined to eat more ice cream at the Ice Cream Marathon than anyone else!
Ice cream is good!
What the croak was that?
What? That's a frog dressed up like a Gnome Knight.
And now you're, like, attracting a mate?
Oh. Well, you should just let go, man.
Uh-oh.  Somebody's gonna do a quest for a frog.
Huh?
Beans?! Ah ha ha! Magic beans... hee! We'll be right back. Come on, Finn. I think I dropped my spoon in the bush.
Dude, what's goin' on?
What?! The beans?  Now wait a second!
Well, we should get a move on if we wanna make the Ice Cream Marathon.
Really? We have to do the bean quest?
Yeah, I wasn't here for that, so... can't we guard the beans and eat ice cream?
...unless you're a clown. I do say that a lot.
Gee, sittin' in this hot sun, guarding beans. It sure beats 26 miles of vanilla ice cream. Or caramel ice cream. Or peach ice cream. Hey, what if we plant the beans ourselves?
No, wait, hear me out. See,  if one of these beans is evil, then it's our duty to crush it, once and for all! Plus, two of the beans are good. If we plant them, we'll be bringin' twice as much good into the world!
I hadn't even thought about that!
I'm gonna take a cat nap.
If we take shifts, there's less chance of us falling asleep at the same time.
Huh?  Oh!
Aw, look how cute they look all sleepy and snore-y.
Aw, they're so cute they can hardly hold their pencils.
Nothing evil could be this adorable.
YES!  You hear that, guys? You passed! A-plus! A-plus-plus!
Stay back, babies!
What? COOL!
WOW!
It's a wand that poops glitter! What's good-er than that?!  Whee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
Hey, let's have some fun with these pigs before the evil pod shows up!
I'm exhausted!
And then go to the Ice Cream Marathon, right?
Okay. I'll take the first shift.
It's bigger than the other two, dude!
Huh?  It's squirting!
See? Squirting. Right here.  Tastes good.
No, it's not. It's... ice cream!
That was awesome.
No, man! It was awesome!
Aw, yeah!  This pod makes ice cream out of nothing! It's the goodest thing that's ever happened to me!
And so are the fairy wands.
Well, I found my weakness .
What about ice cream?
Just the thought of that scares me, man.
Ah, gross! That's--EW!
Ahh, I can't stop dancing!
It must be the glitter! Oh, I really can't stop groovin'! It feels weird! Go on without me!
Whoo! Yeah, man!
Kill it!
He's tryin' to trick you! Kill it!
Not so fast! I'll take it from here, folks.
I've always got room for ice cream, Finn. You know that, man! Ugh, I'm going to the Ice Cream Marathon.Whoops. Hey, what's it supposed to be, anyway?
...Sooo this means you wanna give 'er your spit, huh?
It's okay, dude. I totally get it. Haw haw haw.
You mean her... Super Science Barbecue?!
Relax. She'll love it!  And then she'll love you. Heh heh heh...
Hey, there's Bubblegum!  Hide it behind your back, man!  Princess!
Buddy, just breathe into me.
You're just gonna give a speech to a buncha' brainiacs.
Then we'll just borrow some brains by goin' to the place where knowledge liiives!
Uh, no, the library.
No... Just the regular library.
Hey, Finn, let's split. This turned out to be boring.
Okay, okay... I'll just keep readin' this book about figs.
Haha! Whatcha doin'?!
Yeah, then you can at least sound smart... but where're you gonna find someone like that?
Heh heh heh heh heh.
Oh, yeah.
OH! Let's just solve this thing with magic!
Yeah. It's the easy way out!
Whoa, bud, are you okay?
More spit bubbles?
And how will you do that?
Finn!! Don't do anything stupid!!You got problems, man.
Yeah, be their king.
Finn's gonna need a queen... I'll do it.
Show me what we got, Gummy. Show it to me!  Dude! I'm psyched!
Can you make that a bunk bed?
I call top.
No way, dude.
Maybe, but rules are rules.
I'm in here.
pbbbbbbbbbbbbb. All right, man, how do we do this?
What if they figure it out?
Jump in my mouth.
Alright.
Yep.
Mmhmm.
Wha?
Ohh, uh, a wizard put a curse on me.Finn?  What's going on?  Is the spaghetti allwhoa!  Finn, what happened?
Man, I knew that arm was bogus.
Man, don't worry about that.  You just went through some outrageous beeswax from losing your favorite arm and et cetera. You can't just expect to bounce right back to normal.
Nah, man. Listen.  All these princesses donating all these gross fake armsthey mean well,  but they're throwing you off your game! You got to go at your own pace. If you listen  deep in your melon heart...  that's where the real instructions are.
Well, those things are bad,  so they can't be the real instructions, but you keep listening. MeI'm going to go to the spaghetti store and buy a new mop head. I'll be back soon. Just rememberlisten to your melon heart.
Afternoon Princess. What's that you're building?
I might.
Jake, I'm going to space to punch my dad and steal his arm. Back Soon -Finn  Wow, what the he?
Word. Word.
Pfft. TMLO Princess.
That means lay off. Finn's feeling this one out solo style. Give the kid a chance.
Goodnight buddy, I'm proud of you.
Finn's just working some stuff out,  AND IT'S HEALTHY!
Feelings hurt!
Eeeeeeeeeah.
Oh, hey buddy you're back. How are you feeling?
Ha, Ha! That's great!  You can always trust the old melon heart to get you through.  So I guess we won't be needing this thing anymore. You wanna do the honors?What? Finn?!
I'm coming!
Yo, bro, you're sleepwalking again! Wake up!
Yes, Finn. Again. Every time youse is screaming about She's got me! and all that.
Wait, you don't remember? You just woke up, man! Recall it, baby! Come on.
That's too much; don't punch yourself.
You're repressin' the memory, dude!
You're hiding whatever she is in a mental vault.
Okay, so you even know you're doing it?
Listen, we gotta find out who this lady is. We gotta open the vault a little.
This is just gonna keep happening, man.
Finn, for reals.
Alright. Chill, chill. Don't sweat it, man. It's not even a thing.
Why don't you clean up the kitchen now?
It's alright. It's only, like, the fifth room you've train-wrecked this month.
Wow, that was fast.
While you were doing that, I downloaded a new game on BMO.
Huh?
I don't know. Lady said it's good.
Naw, this is different.  It's different.
Go in there, man! Don't be scurred.
What do you see?
Do you remember anything about the scary lady?
How you doin', buddy?
That's cool. Whachu' gonna do about it?
What was thaww, no.  Dog-drangit, Finn...Yeah, man. Makes me wish I didn't have to poop ever again and could just la... ah...ow! Hey, what the heck am I laying on? Hmm!
Let's get outta here and wreck some stuff with this thing!
Oh, snap, look!
Sorry, this thing's kinda got a mind of
Ah-haha!
What are we gonna do?
Wow, Ice King! Heh heh! That was amazing!
You got it.Dude... how long are we gonna follow this frog?
It looks cool in there!
What're you talkin' about?  I got two keys right here!
Wow! Look at this place!
They look like donuts.
Wait a second... I don't know what poison smells like.
Hey!
No, I didn't. I just sniffed it.
Listen, Mrs. Witch.
Well, I never ate your donuts.
No, I'm not!  Whoa-hoa! Hm... That's weird... I don't even remember grabbing this. My subconscious must be hungry, huh? Huh... whatever.
Uh-oh.
Yeah... I think so. Just a little chilly.  WHOA!
Yeah, it's not like I killed your husband or somethin'.
And what gives?  I used to have like eight more of these things.
Well, you can forget it because you're the one who's wrong!  ...Right?
Ha. That takes me back. Let me just...  remember.  I see a memory. When I was just a pupster... I'm rollin' around in a mud puddle, and I'm just... lovin's it. Oh, no!  Whoo... Remembering is hard work.
Oh. Um... I went into the mud, and... I guess I became a magic dog?
That's nuts, man. You got any idea of how many mud puddles are in the land of Ooo? Four? Maybe even five?
Nonsense... but I like it!
Yeah, let's do it!
I forgot that I don't have magic powers anymore. How do we search for the mud without my powers?
This whole time, I thought running was some sort of... leg magic.  Huh... Look at me. I'm runnin'!  Oh, no...   Running... is... evil...
It's too hard!
I can't reach.  You good, Finn?
I'll stretch into a boat!  I'm startin' to really miss that old magic of mine.
Man, that looks exhausting.
What are you?!
Okay, what are you doing here?
Ha ha!
Man, I'm glad I met you.
Uh, I can't swim that river, dude. My subconscious says it's too hard. Check out this hat, though.
Whatcha workin' on, Finn?  Look at you! Doin' stuff!  Oh, is it a chair?  A chair for my butt?  Mud-venture!
Oh, yeah! I can feel this workin'! In fact, you should roll in the mud with me, Finn! We can both be magic!
This isn't the right mud. I was just really hopin' this was over and done.
Actually... I'm feeling kinda chubby-tired. Can't we do this tomorrow?
Never! I'd rather be powerless forever then apologize! I'm lazy but prideful.
Adventuring is too much hard work for a bro without his powers.
Nah, from now on, I'm just your regular old dog. ...Ironic given my current man-baby body.
I'll scare her off, Finn!
Finn! I've got an idea!
Rub my belly! Yeah, I'm one of those kinda dogs.
Finn?  Finn! Come on, Finn! You gotta save yourself! I'm just a dog! Aw, man. Oh, geez... Okay. Then I'm back on the team!  I'll save you!
Don't worry!  Hey, Finn... Can you help me to get up there?
If only I had my powers back!
I know, I know! I have to apologize to that Witch.
Hey!  Witch! I need my powers back! So I'm sorry! I'm so sorry I ate your donut!
...Oh.  So do I get my powers back?!
What?! Why?!
No way, Jose!
He's my subconscious.
I, Jake the dog, while slow-dancing with my subconscious, with flowers in my underwear, do humbly apologize...
You're recording this?!
No way. I have my dignity.
Oh, no, dude! What do we do now?
Wha?!
Why are you dying, bro?
No! No!
Yeah!  If only... I were a humbler guy, my subconscious would be alive, and my best bud wouldn't be trapped in a mermaid's nest!
My powers! How can I ever thank  Ha! Got your cane!
NOPE!!!
Honey, I'm back! How about a big kiss?   You guys are so cute! I could just maul you to death!
Well, I'm glad you learned your lesson: that in a crunch, there's nothin' I wouldn't do for ya.
Uh...  No way! I must have found the right... mud puddle! Yeah... I don't remember. Heh...You and BMO play Finger Spread quietly. I need to get into the zone.  I am ready to receive instruction from the realm of creation above me and the sandwich I am about to conceive. I am open; use me.
One, two, three, four, five, six.  Rosemary, thyme.  Sous-vide. Keep that at 135 degrees.  All right, now we're gettin' somewhere.  Cream cheese! Pickles from my boy Prismo! And some dill!  Diced boiled eggs! Bird from the window! Yeah, baby, now we're rollin'! Whoo!
Common cucumber! Sliced Roma tomato. Sweet yellow onionorganic.  Oh, almost done.  Tears for salt. Meat prepared sous-vide. Bacon.  You're the most important part.  Lobster soul.  It's amazing! Ohhh,  this is the greatest sandwich I've ever made!
You guys want some?
Thank you.  Magic Man!
You stay away from my woman! Eh, my sandwich!
Sandwiche! Mijo! Magic Man! My sandwich!
What are you gonna do with it? Something gross?
NOOOO!
Give it back, you animal!
That's not even a riddle! It's wordplay, at best!
Ow!
What the?
What's he doin' in there? Why did he freeze himself with my sandwich?
Aww, that's gross!
Yeah, okay.
Hey, Finn.
How long have we been in here?
Retreat!
Five hours?!  He's halfway to hittin' the ground... which is when he'll bite my sandwich, probably.
Must be his new software.
What?! BMO, are you serious?
Yes!
Yes!
Are you sure?
Okay, BMO.
He lied to me.
Maybe I should just make another one.   Eh, okay. Let's do this. I can make another awesome sandwich. Creation realm, inspire me once again!   Okay.
Oh... maybe... maybe it's just as good!  Blech!  It's terrible!  Dang you, Magic Man! You took my one and only!
Not too well. BMO looks cool, though.
What's your plan?
I'm lighting these candles so I can move on with the grieving process. I made them with the leftover bacon fat from my sand
Tree Trunks?! No, man, don't call Tree Trunks! What's she gonna do, bake an apple pie?! Don't you get it?! It's over. It's over, and I've never been so sad. And you know what? I got to deal with it.
Hmm? What? But how?
What?! Nobody  calls it that.
Right.   Magic Man, I'm gonna sock you in the head!
Uh... okay!
Hey, Mr. Cupcake, you stay away  from Lady!
Uh...
What? Um, I love you too, Mr. Cupcake. I didn't want to hang because I thought Lady was into your muscles. And I thought if we'd hung out, you'd sweet-talk her and take her from me.
Dude, I have so much respect for you! I try to be like you in some aspects of my life! Look, if something were to happen to me, and I wasn't here anymore, I'd want you to take care of Lady and the kids.
Me, too!
I'm sorry, Mr. Cupcake!
Ah-haaaaa!
I got you, baby.   This sandwich is so good!Coming up.  I know what you're thinking about.
Kissin' Princess Bubblegum on the mouth!
Yeah, you would. You're just bad at talking to ladies.
Come on, dude.
Yeah, I heard.
Bleh.
Uh, can you, um, give us a minute?
Dude, I don't think we should help her.
'Cause she's a witch!
Her? Are you kidding? Come on, look at her!  If she was good, she wouldn't be so ugly.
No, man! She'll kill us or put a freaky curse on us or something.  Let me get rid of her with some of my world-famous smoove talking.   Hey. Sorry about that, girl.  Ahh. You don't mind if I take a load off, do you?
How pretty you are.
We were just saying someone as pretty as you doesn't even need a full head of hair.  Isn't that right, buddy?
Girl, if I didn't already have a G.F., I'd be on you like butter on toast!
Oh. Umm...
Yeah, I think I'm making things worse.
Ah-ah-ahhh!
What?
Um... spaghetti dinner?
Hey... uh... what's?! Yaaah! Hey!
I told you she was evil!
Nyuh! Get some princess hair!!
Noooo!
Dude, if they think you like them, then use that. Embrace it! Find the least terrible princess you can, play her some music, cook her a meal, smoove talk her until she likes you. And then get the hair!
Marry a princess if you need to! Just get her hair! Aaaah!
Go get the hair!
Just give it to her, already!!
What?!
Aaaah!
Duuuude!
Duuuude!
Du-hu-huuude...
Huh?
I don't.Finn? Finn?
Finn, I'm bored. Are you sure Princess Bubblegum doesn't like me anymore?
Sounds weird. Are you lying so you can do this dinner thing alone with Bubblegum?
I don't know if this is a good idea after your break-up with Flame Princess. PB is out of your age range, anyway.
Yo, man, how's it going? Terrible?
Go on.
So whatcha saying here?
Oh, dang! Didn't you hear? She's got a new boyfriend already!
Man, I'm just kidding.  She might, though.What's the status?
Nice! Seal the deal, bro!
You can do it, you hear me?!  I'm playin' BMOcall me later, bye!
I think it's goin' good.
Where's the key to the tower, BMO?! Tell me! AAAGH!
Hey, man! What's the status?
Awww. I'm sorry, Finn. But look, man. Lemme share with you a little secret on how to win the heart of a princess. It's not easy, but ya have to be persistent. You might have to defeat a demon lord, and warp through several worlds.
But once you do, you walk up the wizard stairs, and produce your magic key you got in a water world and unlock the chamber door. Then, walk right up to the princess, and give her a smooch.
Yesss!  Does that make sense?
Mmm-hmm.Whooo-hoo-hoo!
Noooooo!
Don't let him eat it all!
Yeah! Wowowowowo
Best apple pie ever!
You ate all the pie...
I'd carve my face on the moon so the moon would look like my face!
That sounds awesome!
YEAH!
Or your trunk.
And your satisfied face.
We love you, Tree Trunks.
Psst, I can take you even higher on my shoulders.
Oh, yeah.
Whatever it is, I'm liking it. Oh, yeah!
Whoo!
Nah, she'll be fine.
It's fine. It's fine!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine, she'll be fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
Where'd she go?
Where are you, Tree Trunks?
Hiya!
Finn?!
You go fightI'll keep Tree Trunks out of trouble.
Yeah, Finn can handle it. He's 12.
Uhh, you should stay here, Tree Trunks.
Uhh, no way.
She got passed me, man. I tried to stop her, but she overpowered me.
Huh?
Finn, kill it!
Whoa, man.
That's what happens when you care too much, dude.
You're the man, Tree Trunks!
Whoa! Let her kiss your cheek, man. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Finn! Graw!
Ow! Ow.
Whoo! Shake it, Tree Trunks!
Crud, this is barf dude.
I'll get the make up.
I'm okay with it.
And I'm stupid.
Heh-heh, you heard the guardian, TT. Bite that thing.
Yeah! How is it?Whoop!
Bouncing!
Oof! Yes!
AAAAAGH!
You're still biting me!!
This is... new. It's nothin' ominous, though. Just a bump.
What? You think I'm gonna turn all lumpy like her? Get outta here.  Wha? Finn, I think I'm freakin' out!
Uh, could you skip to the part where you tell us where the antidote is?
Actually, I think I'm beating it back with sheer willpower!   Oh, my.
Aw, Finn, this music ducks, right?  Ah. I love this song. We should totally TP Shandala's house!  Gracious! That was terrible! Finn, if you can't save me from the lumps... if I do turn... if I become lumpy like them, I want you to
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm saying that if I go totally lumpy, then I want you to get used to lumpy Jake. What did you think I was sayin'?
Um... bumps.
Aw, man!
No. Because no matter how messed up and lumpy I get, this guy never turns his back on me!  Oh, yah. Right behind ya. Just gotta turn my back on this guy.
Yeah! Promcoming! Yeah! Cool!
No!
No!!
Chyah! I remember you! You're just a smoothie wannabe lumpy poser!
NO!!
Hey. Stop talkin' to yourself, dumb guy. Take your ball and get outta here.
So I can't have it now, eh?
GIMME THAT BALL!!
I want it! Give it to me!
Bumps, bi   Oh, I'm not lumpy anymore! Oh, no. Finn buddy! You gotta sit on this!
Finn! Hey, Finn! Hey, buddy! Finn

That sounds totally lame.
Heh heh heh. I'm just kiddin'. Let's dance!Ha ha! Yeah man!
I call being dog and you be human!
Dog! Dog Dog Dog Dog!
What? Oh yeah.  Bark! Bark Bark Bark Bark!
Ready! Bark!
More like the perfect blow! That blew.
Hey, you want me to grab it?
Okay, but it's right here
Good luck buddy!
Wohoah! You're tiny!
Uhh! No wonder it's been takin' so long! Need any help?
Okay, well, I'm gonna walk Lady home. I'll be back later. Don't eat any more magic apples. Silly.
Thank you for packing.
You should take it easy.
No, no, let's get you back.
The perfect throw!If anybody wants tea, it will be ready in a few minutes.
Whoa, Flame King!
Ooh!
He was saying evil, evil, evil over and over again.
Well, I wasn't sure if you heard him 'cause he was whispering.
Well, I was just trying to help.
Camomile tea!Don't forget LSP's diet cola.
Ice latte for my lady.
We're so excited that you could be here tonight for Finn and Jake Movie Club's feature presentation...
Yeah, that's on all the movies we dig up.
Pause, BMO.
Sorry we had to cancel.
But these movies are before the Great Mushroom War.
Dude, we never found a movie without that warning.
Well, what are we gonna do?
Wowp!
Start to truck in. Keep going. Keep truckin' in, BMO.
Yeah. Fantastic, super.
Don't lose her, BMO!
BMO! BMO, you're gonna miss it! Over there on your right.
Look over there. Across the river.
I don't get it. It's just a bunch of random junk.
Yeah, like a romantic comedy.
Wait, that's not what I said.
I thought it was great.
I think we should use all of it.
What?
Okay, you're having a picnic, you're in love but you can't admit it. So you're having a playful food fight. And action.
Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut, that was not what I wanted!
What's next?
Hey Finn.
How 'bout when the chariot takes off, she says something like, Mmm, check, please.
I'm sorry.
Well, I thought it was funny.
Not the way you're shootin' it.
All right, but after this we do my part.
Okay, everyone. It's been a long day. A lot of...  A lot of running around, chasing frogs . But we are makin' a movie and this is the big wedding scene. Mr. Cupcake, playing Todd Johnson.
And Lady, you confess that you never loved Todd Johnson and that you were just trying to win a bet with your snooty socialite friends.
And then, you both realize you do love each other and you both say I do. And then Shelby, you say...
Heh, heh, heh. Yeah. Don't forget to look right at the camera and slap your cheeks like this.  And 1, 2, 3 action!
Lady! Cut! Cut, cut, cut!  I didn't tell you to flex out!
No, I don't like the way he's flexing at you.
Why you... GAAH!
Okay.
Uh-huh.
Me, too.
Yeah, I was just thinking that.
I know.
Yep...wait! No!
Romantic comedy!
What do you mean what?!
Yeah, me or Finn?
Why wait?  Dear BMO, Please use only the best footage when cutting the movie. Love, Jake.
See you at the movie club, then.
As will I.
Heh heh. Alright, thanks again everyone for coming to...  movie night! I hope y'all are in the mood to laugh.
It's, ahh, it's more of a romantic comedy. Right, BMO?
Yeah, I guess we will. Start the movie, BMO.
Me too, dude.What?! No more crackers? Eeeee.  Prismo! Prismo! Hey man, Hey!
Bad news, you ran out of cheese crackers.
Yeah, man, what are you going to do about it?
Prismo, you make me happy, Prismo.
I'm always smiling when I'm around you. I just noticed that. I always am.
This feels so good.
What's up.
Aw, don't worry, he ain't gonna hurt nobody.
Ha! You got a cup on your head. Ha-ha, you dingus!  See, he's docile as a lamb.
Yeah, man, make your dreams come true.
Oh, what time is it?  Hey, yo, Clock Face, what time is it?!
Aw, boo to that! Yo, Prismo I gotta get back before Finn realizes I'm not home. He gets worried if I stay out too long.
Laters.
I was, umm, in the, uh... All right, man, I'm gonna come clean. I've been doing a lot of partying at Prismo's lately.
Come on, man! I don't even take Lady up there.
Whoa, what?
Whoa.  Are you gonna go see him?
Yeah, or maybe he was ambushed in the wild and hid you so you wouldn't be captured, too.
But... it might also be good to find out if you have any genetic risk factors or allergies or whatever. Plus, you get to see what you'll look as an old guy. Could be cool.
Cool. Oh! If we hurry, Prismo might be still partying.
No. Prismo, we need to get to the Citadel.
I know you can't grant Finn and me any more wishes. So, we brought Shelby along to wish on our behalf.
Shelby!
Dang, Shelby.
So, what do we gotta do? Rob a cosmic bank? Steal a space baby?
That's it?
That doesn't seem much of a crime.
What?
Oh, oh, sorry.
Come on, Finn let's go find this old guy.
Nope. Hey, upside-down duck!
No, wait, it's right side up.
Aha!
Hey! Get out here, old man!
Hey, get out here, old man.
Uh oh!  Finn, a little help?
Gizzow
Let's see here.
Dude's got serious night terrors.
So, wait, what happens to him when we wake him up?
Prismo.
You sure about this?
Still feels like a bad idea, man.
Prismo, don't worry! I'll put the old man to sleep and get you back!
Aw, no man, how are you gonna see your dad?!
Old man Prismo.
No, old man Prismo, don't talk to him.
Old man Prismo! No!
Lich! I'm gonna kill you!What?
Whoa!  Where did ya get this baby?
Oh, yeah? Like what?
Yeah, buddy!  Nice! Let's crank this beast up.
Nuts. BMO, you know anything about cars?
Wait... I know someone who's good with mechanics.
Hey, Banana Man.
Yeah, alright.
Whoo. I'm bushed. You guys wanna pick this up again in the mornin'?
Yeah.
Biodiesel.
Well, then go over and talk to her.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard.  Pardon me, miss. My friend here is super smart, and he rebuilt this truck.
Anyway, his name is Banana Man. If you like what you see, give him a call.
You gotta stop listening to all those conspiracy shows.  They twist up your noodle so you can't tell what's real.
You want some tea?
Bye, Banana Man!Yo, Finn, look what I found!  A vertical trampoline! It's sticky!
Ohh. Well, cut me out, yo!
You got anything sharp?
They were too long, Finn.
Augh! You broke the skin, dude!
It's cool, man.
I'm gonna take a nap while you grow out your fingernails. We'll make our escape when I wake up.
Oh, snap, how long was I out?
It's okay, Finn. You bought us some time.
There's nothing! Just a bunch of nature.
Alright, one... two... three!
Here comes another one. One two three!
Good job! Last chance for life. Break out!
He feels crazy about making you cry.
We're free!
Oh, no. You got that look on your face. You going back to help that fool?
Spider marriage is complicated. Sometimes, you just gotta mind your own biz.
Ugh... Go with Glob.
Yo, smoothin' things out?
Something we're not supposed to see.
Nice.
Love like theirs will always find a way. It'll crawl all up over you and drain your body fluids, poisoning you slowly until you pass out.  Circle of life, Finn... circle of life.Should have stuck to your diet!
How about I swaddle you up like a sweet baby.
Why'd we do this again?
Hmm... That didn't really explain anything.
Yeah, this place is deserted, except for that guy.
Settle down, prisoner! We gotta record your belongings. One magical crown,  probably stolen.
Okay!
Five counts of jerkateering. Ha!
Dude,  be calmed by my saliva and think of all the terrible things he's done.
The Candy Kingdom!
I'm glad that's all taken care of.
Awww...
This sucks.
Man, there are a lot of secret door around here.
By getting us to beat the tar out of him.
Dude, how are we gonna get those howls?
That sounds ominous. I don't like it!
We're out of options. Let's just beat it out of him.
Hey, what about me?
Good job! Those wails must have reached all the way to...
Finn, if I came across your lifeless body, I'd clasp you dramatically for a kajillion years.
Hey, why wait?! Play dead, Finn!
Why?! Heh heh heh heh. Why?! Heh heh heh heh. Why?!Hey, man, what you doing?!
Don't worry, bro. We won't tell anyone about the private time you spend with your wad of Princess Bubblegum's hair.
Finn, we're roommates. Which is why I'm gonna share my beloved keepsake with you.
Babadadaa! My old baby blanket.
That guy must do crazy squats.
Can I be the jerk it the band? 'Cause that's an important part of a band's success.  Hmph.
Let's see if you hacks can keep up with my raw talent!
Well, I know what's missing. Talent. I'm getting out of here, you hacks! Talentless hacks!
Hmph!
Shut yo' face. I came back for the music.
You've all forgotten 'bout the music! I quit the band!  I'm just pretending!
So hand over our stuff.
...That the real treasure is friendship.
Okay, here's that lock of Bubblegum's hair you love so much.
And here's Jakey's blankey.  Here's your controller, BMO.
Marceline, here's your rock shirt.Hey, man.
Oh, you know, just takin' this garbage bag of butter...  ...into the house.
HAHAHAHAHA!
Heh, yeah, I'm a genius.
Whatever. I'm gonna take a day long nap.
I might wake up at any moment! Naaaah, I'm still asleep.
Ahhh, hey, duAAAAAH!Are you okay, dude?
You look bored.
Well good, because I'm about to kick it up a notch.
Could be anybody.
The Ice King?!
Yeah! Kick his butt, dude!
Whoo, hoo hoo!
This is weird, dude.
Yeah, good luck with ye and thy creepy wedding.
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Shhh, I know. I know that you can't have that. Don't worry.  Alright, let's go party, Ice King.
Have fun being married!
But you said you were fine with it!
What? Are you serious?!
Finn, Finn, cool yourself, buddy. We need to get this guy married, remember?
Watch.  Let big brother handle this.  Hey, Ice King? Don't be nervous. Marriage is the most beautiful thing that could ever happen to a jerk like you.
Why?  Poots, that guy is good. Why? Why?
Not now!  Why, why, why, why, why?
Eh, let's cross that bridge when we get to it. Look how happy he is.
All that's left is the lousy wedding.
Uh-huh. This wedding looks lame, man.  Be prepared to be bored outta your mind.
It wasn't meit was my foot, dude.
Look at her ring.
Wait a minute!  So you knew she was cursed all along, which means you knew she wasn't trying to steal your Demonic Eye Junk or whatever, and you knew you had total control of her!
So then why did you make us go through all that junk about why marriage is worth stuff?!
She wants to marry you because you brainwashed her!
Gotcha!
Hehe, no problem.
Whoa!
Hey.
Huh? Oh. Oh yeah. Now she's not hypnotized, but we're still frozen.
Oh, good.
Wait, what the? What am I laughin' about?
Well, I wouldn't say everything.What'cha think?
It's crazy far, man.
Eh, go for it.
Not really.
What, like, no ladies?
Yeah, two people is mad efficient.
It's a beach brawl!
That's not a barn. That's a dude!
You don't want bionic legs. It ain't natchy.
Let's discuss this later.
Yeah way, we can't! He's the ultimate!
Man, I already am a legend in other aspects of life. Third highest score in Kompy's Kastle, bro.  Third... in the Candy Kingdom.
Okay. How are we gonna beat him, then?
He can't even walk.
Yeah, I was just kiddin'. Let's destroy that guy!
Whoof.
Let's see your Chokey Brokey Style!
Nice one.
Now watch my... Something Style.
Huh? Whoo! Uh... yes.
Look, I'm a full-grown dog of my own, and I need to play Kompy's Kastle every day so I can maintain my rank.
I never really take anything seriously... 'cept Kompy's Kastle.
KOMPYYYYY!
I'm gonna break every bone in your body, then heal you later with that magical goo we got from the Cyclops' eye!  AAAH!
Apologize!
I'm gonna turn up the juice!
My little face!
Ouch!  Ow.  Oh!  Where are ya? Huh?
Huh?
Come out, you chicken nug!
Ow.
Apologize to Kompy's Kastle!
Ehh, gross!
Ow!
AAH! My eyes!  Cheap move, you butt rag!
Oh!
Bring it on, bro!
OUCH! Ow! O-o-o-ow! No bities!  Grrrrr!
I'm gonna knock down the Farm just so you'll never know the taste of downing the Farm!
The only way you're gonna win is if you use your cheap moves.
Hey.  Come on! You gotta fight the dude!
Yeah, that's what you get.
I do, because peeps need to respect themselves when they leave the house... even if it's just for ice cream, or TP, or whatev.
What is going on here, Dream Warrior?
Hey, did you dream about Dream Warrior?
I don't know; I didn't get it. But listen, man. I'm sorry I got mad at you. Who cares about my high score at Kompy? It ain't important.
Well, good thing we're rested, 'cause now we can beat this beast.
Dudes came back to watch us fight!
Uh, all we did was fight dirty with cheapwait.
Dream Warrior was telling us what cheap moves to use on the Farm! Headlights mean eyes!
Give-up-on-life pants!
Two golden apples!
Well, sure. I can make a wild guess.
Yeah, dude!
Put your pants on.Yeah?
Of course, dude.
Wait! Let's not be too rash! Just look at this guy!  Check out the sunken, lifeless eyes... The foul stench of decay... You know what that means?
Well, evil, sure... but mostly, he's unattractive, and unattractive people are desperate. You should haggle with him!
Play it cool, Finn.
He's here... but he's not you.
We should beat 'im up until he starts makin' sense!
Oh, boy!
Whoo!
Yeah! So am I!
It is a lie... and I take full responsibility for it!
Yeah! And I am into it! It's, like, gossamer!
Yeah, you can! Do what I do! RAAAAWR!!  Oops.  Ah, there we go.
Haha! Observe my magics!
Dude, you got your star, too!
Well, that's... sorta cool.
Whoo, yeah! Force that enthusiasm!
What bowl?
Mmmm, fine...
Dude, it's okay. They're just peeled grapes.
Nah, I'm good.
Eh... I've got everything I need. A limitless supply of mayonnaise, this captivating new hairstyle... and I just learned the best spell of all!
Sleep.
Reflect.
Huh??
Full circle!!I know! We got here six hours early, you dork! Just wake me up when they start selling hot dogs.  Whoa! What do you know!
Boo!
You're a loser.
But we're not wizards, man. What about the sanctity and honor of Wizard Battle?
Ooooh! You don't care about the Ice King. You just wanna kiss Princess Bubblegum.
Mm-hmm. Yeah, you do.
Yeah, you do.
Over there!
Okay. When the wizards start to battle, let's go hide behind that rock.
Looks like everyone had the same plan.
Whoa. This kid looks like a wimp.
Why isn't the Grand Master Wizard seeing this?
Uh-uh.
Whoa.
Wow, man.
I've never heard you scream like that before. You were all like, Nooo! No one kisses her but me!
Then stop hiding you feelings, man! Go out there, and smooch it up!
Good job. You got the kiss, man.
Don't worry about that, 'cause you look totally cool right now.
Okay, am I cool now?Yo, that stinks! Tonight's part 3 of his graveyard secrets workshop.
That makes sense.
Yeah, I mean, magic's probably more natchy for your body in the long run.
Wizards don't play.
Yeah, man, this is it.
Wo-o-o-o-o-o-o-op!
Nothing. Just more mountains. I think the wall knows we're not wizards.
How do you trick a wall?
For reals?
That was a nice try, man.
Boo.
All right, what am I, then?  This don't look like magic to you?
Boring.
We need a spell for the cold.
Dude...
What?
Dude, don't make me feel any more awkward than I already do!
Shush!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! We don't want trouble!
That's what you get for asking a magician about his tricks, PB!
Psst! Wizards rule!
Ridiculous, huh?
Ouch!
Hey, let's count the days.  One.
Sleep tight, Princess!
Yeah, we still got to heal the snuffins out of Starchie with this little baby here.No! Bunk that, I'm tired! C'mon, Finn!
Of course, dude!
That's Chocoberry. Why are you guys spyin' on Chocoberry?
Yo wait! They threw a basketball at my head one time! Are you gonna let that slide?!
You sacks! I'll rip your cups!
Hmm.
Crazy lightbulb hardcore style!
Hop on!
No Lemongrab.
Just an empty room with a catcher's mitt!
