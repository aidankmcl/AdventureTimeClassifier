Heeey, it's okay. Shhh, I'm your guardian angel, Finn. I'm here to save you.
Mmm-hm. Come here, let the angel pick you up.
Are you comfortable? Would you like some snacks?
Here, let me clean you up, and mend your clothes.
I'm taking you to the chamber of the Crystal Eye....
... where I'm going to cook you and eat your flesh.
Trust in your  guardian angel!
As you wish.
Now for little kid soup.  The secret is a low flame over a long period.
I will save thee, Finn.
