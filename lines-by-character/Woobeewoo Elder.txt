Greetings, heroes.
I'm so sorry about that. You know, we--we secrete stink oil all day out our awful-sauce glands. You know, I guess I should have warned you. Anyway, lemme cut the cheese.
Yes... I mean--I mean, of course cut to the chase, I mean, for many--for many moons now our village has been under siege by the Mega Frog. He's 100 stories of 110% 10-speed terror, like, bam, like, fresh out the grease. I mean, he chases us all up and down from first base to home, trying to eat us alive. We--we've always managed to escape, but it's c-razy scary, I mean, w-what if you got ate? Think about it.  All alone in a stomach full of acid.  Mommy! Mommy, Mommy, help me!  Billy, is that you? Mommy you sound exactly--  Mommy you sound exactly like m--  Mommy, you sound exactly like me!  Billy, uh--  Anyway. If this keeps up, we'll have to move to the city and get jobs. We don't know how to--how to do anything cool. Look,  see, th-they're already practicing, the poor fools. They don't know what they're in for.
That is excellent news. I mean, h-here, take this, please.  It's not much, b-but it's all we have--  it's--it's a bag of lollies.
Now farewell, heroes! We're counting on you... for reals!
