Oh, heya, mister, thanks for putting me up last night. I'm just chopping some wood so's I can build a little log cabin to live in.
Randy, wanna get dinner tonight?
You gotta start calling me Davey, mister. Because that's my name!
Daaaaaaaaaavvvveeeeeeyyyyyy!!!
Mister, I don't know nothing about that. I'm just a working joe... trying to stake my claim... under the sun... and look out on the beautiful green fields called... life!
Oh, just attach 'em to the cabin. Like how it should be. So it looks like a cabin. We're gonna build a right wall and front wall. Ummmmm-
Maybe, maybe.
They look good.
Oh, no!
I called the police.
Don't let the dragon........ Jake!
Get outta here Randy!  Geeeet ouuuuut!
No more Davey.
One more time!
Hey, fellas. How's tricks?
Ah! Keys!
