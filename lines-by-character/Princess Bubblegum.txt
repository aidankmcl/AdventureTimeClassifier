What now, Ice King?
I doubt I said that.
Oh, me too.  I'm gonna take care of it, too.
No.
Ice King, give me the anti-virus, or I'll shoot you with my candy horse tranquilizer!
Okay, well, even if I did promised, you're not the last person on Ooo, because I'm still here.
Oh, that's disgusting.
...No.
GIVE ME THE ANTI-VIRUS!
You mean, forever?!
Come on, Finn and Jake....
Useless--  Ugh! --computer!  You sassa-frassin-- Nu!! --hammer-slammin-- Ruh! --wamma-jammin...  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ah-ya-ya-ya-ya!  Finn and Jake!  My heroes!What the...  mmmmn Princess Bubblegum, we are starving, immediately send us all of your candy. How dare you, ours, Lemon Grabs.  Bull gunk! I left them a lifetime supply of candy!
Hey Finn! Hey Jake! Can you come up here? I have a job for you!
Hey, guys. I got a letter from the earls of Lemongrab. They've gone through all the food that I've sent them.  This case contains precious candy seeds for the Lemongrabs to grow new food.  So, I need you two to deliver these seeds to Lemon Castle.
Good luck, gentlemen!
...and... there... we... go.  All done! The last trace of the candy life formula is out of their heads!
Now we all just have to keep a closer eye on those two so they don't get in to any more trouble.
Oh, no, no. Their hearts are fine. They're just like this.Pen!
Oh, thank you, brave knight.
Well, then, thank you, brave boy.
Fair thee well, Pen and Jake.You're not a little kid anymore!
Cinnamon Bun, you can't sleep with a night-light anymore. You're basically thirtyit's starting to bum everyone out.
Yeah, wellCinnamon Bun, what the heck are you doing out in the woods?! I asked you twenty minutes ago to take these drinks around for us.
Gob.
Finn, Cinnamon Bun's gonna attend your juice bar now. I have a special job for you.
As Ooo's greatest champion, I'm relying on you to keep Lumpy Space Princess from crashing this wedding. I went ahead and deputized you.  So, you know, no holds barred, got it?
Well, honestly I haven't seen Jake this happy in a while.
I kinda don't want squash his groove.
Knock, knock. Hey, Tree Trunks.
Thanks, Tree Trunks. Now listen, I don't want you to worry about a thing. I've got Finn on LSP Deputy, and we're keeping your ex-husbands, Randy, Danny and Wyatt, a hundred feet apart at all times - at least until it's time for me to perform the ceremony.
What?! Why not?
WHAT? That fraud?!
That fraud is here?!
I've waited a long time for this King of Ooo, and now I'm gonna expose you in front of everyone for what you really are!
I'm just gonna look in this guy's blimp.  Make sure everything's in accordance...  with the laws.
Everybody! This wedding is a farce! A criminal farce!
I'll tell you what I'm egging at! I'm egging at this outdated wedding officiant license!
What? Uh...
No... shhh... no... nope nope, stop talking, go to jail!  Yeah!
Aww, geez, let them all go, Banana Guard Number 3.
I just can't stay mad at something so cute.Ladies and gentlemen, I have invented time travel. This phasical sphere is flooded with info waves that scan every second, logging every molecule that passes through its volume.  I made special gloves for it.
Now check it out! It's logging time.
I'll set the clock back now.
Now I'll push the time travel button.
No!
For all intents and purposes, they traveled back to an earlier point in their time.
Jake, don't deny my science. This is a time travel machine.
LSP...
LSP, that's not how it works. It can only rearrange your molecules into a previously logged formation, and you need these gloves.
No.
No, I'm sorry, but you need to pull yourself to
Hear me, Lumpy Space Princess, I will avoid declaring war on the entirety of Lumpy Space, ruled by your parents, if you apologize to me immediately.
Sheesh!
So how are you enjoying your time in the Candy Kingdom?
That's wonderful, Johnnie. Now tell me more about gas...
We're under attack!
No. Hide yourself beneath the tablecloth. There's cyanide-laced gum under the table. Chew it if you hear raiders break down the door.
Manfried, where are the Banana Guards?
What did you handle?
Mmm.  Don't chew it! Don't chew it! Don't chew it!
He's not here.
The sphere would have had to log his molecules before you engaged the time travel function.
I don't know.
If that's what you want.
You asked me to use this.'Sup, guys?
Collecting taxes, you guys weren't home. So I let myself in.
What? Why?
What's that all about?
Ooh, a lady-friend, do tell.
Oh, come on, you can tell me.
Okay, you're right, I'll respect it.
What!?
No, this isn't possible.
I just never thought, Flame Princess. I-uh-I have to go.
Morrow!
No, no.  Oh gob, I thought I'd be ready for this.
Finn!
I have something important to tell you. About relationships.
I just hope, you'll understand.  Relationships  are like layers of sedimentary rock.......
If too much frustration builds, the magma will erupt causing a catastrophic super-stratum of igneous rock to form......
Jake!
Wake up!
Jake, where's Finn?
Will you tell him why he can't see Flame Princess anymore?
Great! I cannot stress how important it is that they not see each other.
Finn!
Whatcha doin'?
Oh, well, speaking of Jake. Did he explain everything to you?
And you understand?
Finn, sometimes you want someone and you  want to kiss them, and be with them. But you can't, because responsibility demands sacrifice.
I'm trying to say that you're a hero, Finn. You're my hero. So, I'm glad you understand why you can't be with Flame Princess.
What?
Finn, what are you talking about?
Oh, no!
Finn! Jake, where's Finn? Is he with Flame Princess?
Is he with her?!  Or not?!
What are you..? This isn't about some  petty love triangle! Flame Princess is physically unstable!  Her elemental matrix can't handle extreme romance! Glob, if Finn tries to kiss her, she'll burn so hot, she'll melt right through the planet's crust, down through the molten core, then she'll be thrown back and forth by gravity until she burns out the world from the inside! Why do you think I had her father keep her locked up?!
Will you take me to them?
Faster!
No!
Finn, there's no time! You have to...
Finn!
Wait, wait! Don't move. This is good! If you stay on the hole for 24.8 seconds, the reaction will be deprived of oxygen.  She'll go out.
She's stabilized. We're safe... for now.
Oh, Finn.
What?
Shut up.Whats wrong?!
I'll get something to calm her down.
Out of the way!
I need help! Can you guys hold her down?
Oops.
I think I gave her too much.
Huh? Why?
LSP woke up and went back to her hotel room.Ah fudge! What time is it? I gotta go to Veggie Village for the Annual Technology Fair. Will yall watch my Princess Plant for me?  I usually hire a sitter but- Ehn!
Awesome! Thank you, Finn. I will be back on the Morrow. SCREEEEEEEE!
Farewell everyone!  Okay... Morrow! Back to the Candy Kingdom!
Hello, boys. Wheres my plant?
Yay!  Thank you all for taking such good care of my plant! Now come here and give me a hug!Hmm. Finn, this is literally serious. You have to go dentist.
Welcome home, Finn.
Eh-eh-eh!Huh? Oh, gross!
Hm!
Cinnamon Bun, do something!
That's not what I-
Hm!Alright, guys. Hammer all these safety signs around this dungeon hole. I've gotta jet off on my swan to take care of some royal junk.
Bubblegum, away!!
Get on my swan!
I hope you learned a lesson from all this!
You're darn right I am. Princess Bubblegum, away!!Eh.
Yeah, yeah. Just act like I'm not here.
What?! No, of course not!
I was observing youfor research.  You're a threat, Flame Princess. Your emotions are directly linked to your combustion levels. But if I can create a scientific model that describes your complete elemental matrix, I can isolate and suppress your more... volatile traits.
Umm, yeah, basically!
You will?
Once I press this button, you'll be subjected to a battery of tests to gauge your reflexes, stamina, and your reaction to various emotional stimuli.
There's a 40% chance we'll be able to identify and isolate your chemical componentsand yes, understand you in a very scientific way.
Initiate test.  Yah.  Hello?
Okay, Cinnamon Bun, all you have to do is write down the numbers that appear on this monitor. Can you do that one thing?
Oh, one other thing. Do not open that door.  So that's two things: write down the numbers, do not open that door. Got it?
What's this?
A princess? Must've wandered off.
Flame King?
I found your lost daughter.
Pssh.
That's your problem, but you can't just let her run around the woods. She's too dangerous. Find some way to contain her power, or I will.
Oh, I just wanted to measure Flame Princess's reaction when confronted by the guy who broke her heart.
Hey, Cinnamon Bun, I'm
CINNAMON BUN!!!
There's a note  Gon 2 fyr kingdum. Pleez watch dog.
And if she's imprisoned, I won't be able to complete my tests, and I'll have wasted my precious time!
And I really enjoy the taste of envelopes.
We need to see the king?
Oh-ho, that's why the guards were wigging out.
Take off that silly hat. We're going home.Ugh...
Oh, yes!
Cheeeeese...
Ding ding ding ding ding.
Ha ha! Jingo-jango!
Yeast on third, flour on first, swell the dough, fit to burst! Awhoooooo!
Well... this is it, Cinnamon Bun. The most perfect sandwich that has ever existed, or ever will exist within the confines of space-time. Will you do the honors?
But... but you... you didn't... y-y-you didn't even... taste it...The caterpillar eats the leaf. Then the bird eats the caterpillar. Then the big bird eats the little bird. The big bird then dies, and its remains decompose into rich, fertile soil And from that soil, a new plant bursts to life. And then the caterpillar eats the plant again. And so the circle of life continues. This is a law of nature we call the food chain.
Isn't that fascinating?
No, Terry. They don't.
The caterpillar eats the leaf. Then the bird eats the caterpillar. Then the big bird eats the little bird then dies and its remains decompose into rich, fertile soil. And from that soil, a new plant bursts to life. And then the caterpillar eats the plant again. And so the circle of life continues.That's right, Finn.
The zombie infection has spread across the kingdom once again, ...and once again, it's all my fault.
I was testing a sample of the zombie flesh I had saved when Cinnamon Bun came into the lab. He said he was hungry.
Not now, Cinnamon Bun. I'm busy.
And that's when I made my mistake. I should have paid more attention to that poor fool.  The Candy Zombie flesh he ingested was highly contagious.
Cinnamon Bun? Where did you...  EEEEHHHHH!!!
I escaped, but I wasn't able to stop Cinnamon Bun from infecting the rest of the kingdom. The good news is I still have all my notes for making the antidote formula.
Let's board up the windows then we can get started.
Don't worry, Finn. You have the notes to my formula. Just let Science do the work. Science... is... MAHHRRAHHH!
And so the Royal Day of Apologizing has come to an end.  And now I shall present the Royal Medal for Heroic Bravery. Finn the Human.
Would you please move out of the way?
Science the Rat, you have served your kingdom well.  Citizens of Candy Kingdom, rejoice!
Rejoice!
Rejoice!What is all that noise?  Ach, mein Glob!Hello?
Sounds romantic, Finn.
No, sorry, Finn. I'm busy practicing for the Whistling Choir Death Match Championship.
Auf Wiedersehen! Goodbye
Greetings, Finn.  Hey, Marceline...
Yeah, yeah. So, what's so funny, Finn?
Well, then, keep it down out there! I'm trying to whistle practice!
Oh, hey, Finn! Did'ya ever find someWhoa! What are you wearing?
Finn, that is hilarious!  Oh, you are killing me!
Guards!
Oh, Finn, thank goodness you're here! There's wolves in my room!
I'm sorry to do this, Finn. But until you stop acting like a psycho, you're forbidden from entering the Candy Kingdom. Farewell.As princess of Candy Kingdom, I'm in charge of a lot of candy people. They rely on me. I can't imagine what might happen to them if I was gone. And after my brush with death at the hands of the Lich,  I realized something.  I'm not gonna live forever Finn.  I would if I could.
But modern science just isn't there yet.
So I engineered a replacement who can live forever.
I call her... Goliad.
Oh, um...  Pretty standard candy creature soup.
Some acids.
Some algebra.
And I threw in one of my baby teeth so she had my DNA.
Yeah. All it takes is just one little tooth, or,  a single hair.
It's all it takes.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good. Haven't slept for a solid 83 hours, but... yeah, I'm good.
I can't go to bed, Goliad has huge, mondo mama brains.
I still need to fill them with knowledge...  about how to rule a kingdom.
Uhh, okay. I guess that will be all right.
Huh? Whu...? Bye guys...
Oh, I was afraid this might happen. Where is she now?
Hello, Goliad.
I hear that you learned a lot today.
But Finn said you used yelling and mind control.
Goliad,  let me tell you about leadership. You see this fat bee? It's gentle  and makes the flower happy, and pollinated. They both get what they need... ...and that's how leaders should be.
Oh, no. She's too far gone, too corrupted. If we're not careful, she can throw an ultra-tantrum and wind the castle apart. I will have to disassemble her and try again.
No, Finn. She's far too powerful. Here's the plan: I'm going to build another Candy Sphinx in my lab. It's the only thing that can possibly match her. Just keep her busy 'til I return.  And don't think about the plan! She can read your minds!
No, Finn, she's too
Anyway, like I was saying, she's far too powerful
Here's the plan. I'm going to
Goliad! No!
Finn, are you okay?
That's Stormo, Goliad's new brother.
They're about to have a psychic showdown.
Oh, that's simple: I used some of your heroic DNA in Stormo's recipe and not Goliad's.
Well, yeah... in a way.Hey, Finn.
Codes?
Oh, you called the right person. I know a lot about codes. Let's start withSure! I'll have another...   ...peanut.
Finn... nobody really thought the bear was you.
We just thought it was one of your jokey-joke-jokes.And so, through my experiments with cloud-seeding, I've invented... liquid pyrotechnics.
Aw, thanks, puppy.
Uh, Finn. No. Come on, Finn, don't be weird. Look, I'll see you guys later.What? What happened?!Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming. We may begin the ceremony!
We're on a mission to collect samples only. I want to start colonizing this area by the end of the year.
James, give a readout on fuel.
James, slow down. We're here.
Excellent. Take us down.
Okay. You guys collect as many surface samples as you canrocks, plants, dirt, anything.
Hmm.
Aah! Ach! Brownstadt!
Guys, run!
James, speed up that sack lunch!
Ugh!
Uh, they're toxic creatures from another time.  Okay, let's seesuspension's all donked, navigation's lost, and the ship's legs are kaput. We're dead in the water.
Oh, yuck! Come on! Manners!  Gotta brain out the situation.
Those goo monsters will barf their way through the hull in mere minutes. Finn, what should we do?
Good idea, but looks like the radio's kerplowed.
Yes. James is very resourceful. He'll work it out.
See what I mean? Good job, James.  Come on, guys. Let's take inventory of the emergency gear.
I know, Finn.
Right on!
I knew you could do it, James!
James, the radio's still not working! I'm not getting any signal.
He did his best, you guys.
So what's all the hubbub?
No. James wouldn't do that.
It's not James.
That won't hold them for long.
We don't have time to point fingers.
James. We need to talk.
So, what do you say?
Finn, I need to explain something really heavy. I was the one who sabotaged all your escape plans. I calculated the chance of success for every possible escape plan, and none of them were going to work. You said it yourself: there was only one way out. Someone was going to have to eat the big one to save the others. James did something really noble to save us.
There's a reason. With this sample of James, I can clone a new one. He's candy, but you're not. I can't clone another you.
I made the best choice available.
James served the Candy Kingdom on a dangerous mission, and even though he is gone and it's super sad, I would like to honor James... with this new James I whipped up in the lab!
Here you go, James an award for bravery. Let's hear it for James!Sh! There it is. The weeping Willy.  One drop of its rare sap can flavor an entire stock pot of soup.
James?
Ow!
Oh, not this again.
They're toxic creatures, from another time.
Someone was going to have to eat the big one to save the others.
And even though he is gone, and it's super sad, I would like to honor James... With this new James I whipped up in the lab!
Here you go, James  an award for bravery. Let's hear it for James!
Now hold up. This ground is perfectly solid.  There's no loose gravel here.
James is too reckless. I can't reward this kind of foolish behavior forever. It's time James takes his eternal nap.
I'm putting my foot down. There will be no more Jameses.
I'm sorry. Look, I need you guys to go to James's apartment and box up his stuff.
Hey! Stop running! You rascals, get back here! You are all in so much trouble!  James!
Okay, who's the Banana Guard Leader for this week?
This picture should help you find the Jameses.
There's twenty-five of them.
Nope, you only need that one.
It's because they all look the same.
No! They're clones.
A group of organisms or cells produced asexually from one ancestor or stock, to which they are genetically identical.
It's a long story.
Aaah! There's no time!
No! They're not brothers, they're clones!
Hey! Get down here and help me!  Viginti-quintuplets! I'm telling you...
What are you doing? Why aren't you helping?
Why?
Maybe just a brick.
I have to admit, it's fun to watch.
Okay, fun's over. You're not heroes!  You don't deserve these medals.
Protect the kingdom!
The original James?
I hereby award thee...Jameses...These medals for bravery.
Now for your new assignment, Jameses. Go unto the Wastelands, and never come back.
Do it, and I'll send you a medal every day.
I'm not gonna miss him.My king...  My king?  ...Wake up, husband.
Hm. Not much.
He doesn't know he's dreaming.
Finn, shush! I'm having coffee with the Lich. You wouldn't understand. You're too young.My GPS shows Finn and Jake over there . I think that's where the Ice King has them hostage.
I'm sure the boys are fine. The Ice King isn't usually a serious threat.  Besides, this'll be easy with the two of us.  We've got science on our side.
It's okay, Lady. Jake knows you love him.
Don't worry. Just try to relax.  I'll work on my holo-entry.  It's been three weeks since Finn and Jake disappeared while battling the Ice King. I've activated a secret GPS implanted in Finn's ear. It has lead us to an uncharted black ice cave... but I've spent hours calculating every possible danger and am well-prepared.
Then I'll pull out my Electrode gun.
Then... I'll use my Ball Blam Burglerber! Lady, it'll be fine.   We've got science!
Hmm. I suppose that's true.  Let's roll.
Hold up, Lady.
Don't worry, Lady!  Ball Blam Burglerber-ber!  My field of vision!  HEY!!
Lady, phase through the wall!
Come on. There's no turning back now.
I'm picking up three heart signatures. Ice King must be talking to Finn and Jake.  Go to the right, Lady.
Lady!  Lady, are you okay?
No, Lady. I won't leave you while you're hurt. Come on.
What are you playing at, Ice King?  Three heart signatures. ...Getting closer.
AH!
Ricardio!
Where are Finn and Jake?!
Poisoned with Zanoits.
What...?
STOP!
AH!  LADY!
Okay, Ricardio. I'll do it. I'll be your wife.
If you can beat me  at hand-to-hand combat!
You think we're intellectual equals?! It only took me seconds to get you off your guard! And this body you designed is self-congratulatory garbage! See, I know a thing or two about building a body out of biomass,  and you don't... leave your heart exposed!
You didn't.  Get out of my sight.
I know... and he poisoned you both with Zanoits, but I took care of it.
I dragged you all here on Lady's back.  It took two days. And another day to make you guys an antidote.   And fifteen minutes to build the Ice King a new heart.
I made it out of Ricardio's sinews... and some toffee and maracas.
I'm glad you guys are up. Please make the Ice King leave.
ICE KING, PLEASE LEAVE!!!
How are you feeling, Lady?
Yes. He's awake.  Oh, Lady. I should have never put you in danger.  I saw on the heart monitor. I didn't know.Lights on.  Oh, Lemonhope, were you even paying attention?
I know this is a lot to take in, but one day, saving those lemons is going to be your responsibility. They're in trouble, and you need to work harder at this.
O-kay... Let's try something else.  These are cupcakes.
Lemonhope,  you have two cupcakes. Finn has no cupcakes. Lemonhope, will you give Finn one of your cupcakes?
Maybe we need something more hands-on. Hey, Finn, listen, that's it for class today.
But read the next three chapters of your geometry text! Well, at least he's street-smart.  Okay, dude, we're going on a field-trip.
This is the Lemon Earldom perimeter. Unfortunately, there are pacts and treaties preventing me from getting any closer. We should cloak.  I know you don't like thinking about Castle Lemongrab, but it's where your family is. They set you free, and now they're being punished for it. It rips. Look!
D'ya see? They helped you. You have to help them now. It's your responsibility.
Dude, I'm sorry, but that attitude is unacceptableoh! I mean...  Lemonhope?
Psst. Down here.
Psst. Lemonhope, it's me. You are... You are unacceptable!You know, I was thinking, Lemonhope. Maybe you'd like to stay here in Lemongrab while Lemongrab recovers. Ever kingdom needs a champion, and you're a true champion if ever I've seen one. Plus, I already set up a little room for you.
Like what?  Oh, heh, no, no-no-no-no. Once his brains and bodies remix, he should be back to his lonely old self, which seems to be his only stable relationship model.
So will you stay, Lemonhope, and help your people once more?
Oh, but I thought...
Me too. I even wrote a song about it.
Hey! Don't laugh.
No! It's terrible.
No!
Gah! Okay, okay.Clear your minds.
I have to go check on something!
...Perhaps you are ready to go with.  Guys, you'll need to put these on.  Pull back your hat.
Stay close to me.
At the heart of this tree is an ancient evil, held in a prison of amberthe Lich.
He's casting spellstrying to get in your head and control your bod... but these gems are protecting our minds from his influence. If we lost the gems, we'd be defenseless.  He would have full control over us.
Beyond Iceberg Lake lies the ruins of the Lich's tower, where he was converting the planet's life force into unholy power to destroy all of Ooo... but before he could, the Legendary Billy attacked him and pummeled him into the resin of this tree.  IWHAT THE NUTS?!
Quickly! To the other secret room!  There's only one known weapon that can harm the Lich.  The Gauntlet of the Hero.
Finn, you have but one chance. While the Lich isn't at full power, you must smite him with this gauntlet!  His only desire... is to destroy life.   If you fail... he'll kill everyone.
Oh, and there's something else that I want you to have. The Lich's lair is supposed to be cold. ...I just don't want you to get sick.  Take this sweater. I made it myself.  I'm not great at knitting, but please wear it. I care about you, Finn.
Quickly now, Finn! Track the Lich by his trail of death.
Be safe!
Oh, Finn and Jake, please be okay.  Please be okay... please be okay...
Ice King?! Get outta here!!
That's insane!
NO!!
Guys! Don't let the Lich reach his well of power!   Oh, no!! He's made it!!
Oh, Finn... you did it!Yes, I'm fine. I just need to rest.
The ice wizard is a weak fool....
Finn... I need you to get me some things...
Jake...
Thanks.
I'm busy!
Give me a hug, hero.Oh! Uh oh!
Whoa! Holy flippin' flap! Red alert!  Pep But, start brewing up some chamomile tea so I don't stress out!
Yo! Red alert!  Right, guys? What'cha doin' about it?!
What is going on here?
I thought you were gonna whip these guys into shape, Colonel.
Okay, you guys. Keep up the good work.
Hey, Peps, where's the tea?!
Just leave it out for me. I'm gonna go find Finn or Rattleballs or somebody to run down this Peace Master bozo.  Take my time? Alright.
Where's Peace Master?! Gah, I am freaking out here!
Whff! Thanks.Be careful!
Finn...
Thank you.
Thank you for saving my kingdom, boys. The deer wanted our sugar, but I didn't give him any, if you know what I mean.It's starting, everyone! The celestial alignment!Okay, okay. How about I give you a big cowboy hat? Then will you let the hostages go?
Well, obviously that's going to be a problem, because I'm the princess and I need my crown. So...
I don't know, guyshe's crazy. He's left me no choice. I'm sending in the banana guards. It's about to turn crazy nasty.  Hello. Captain Banana Guard?
Hmm. Okay, but if you guys aren't out of there by  4:00, I'm sending in the guards.
Hmm. I can't really see that working.
Oh, no-no-no, that part's fine. I was talking about you dressing up like a mailman.
Nah, you don't look like a mailman. You look like a milkman. Let's get you a proper milkman outfit.
...a thunderous cheer  as Baby Whoozlefut...
Anything your sweet heart desires!
What?
Jake? Jake, what's going on? Where's Finn? Where are the hostages?
Right... and then you and Finn hunt him down and put him in the dungeon.
No. That cookie is a menace. Once the hostages are safe, Cookie goes in my dungeonin my dungeon for his life.
Okay, well... she's all yours!
After them!I'd love to, but I'm really invested in this crossword puzzle.
Hmm.
Ha. Just don't let her get out of control.
Nooooo exclamation point, exclamation point, exclamation point!Hey, someone stole half of my face.Does everyone have a tray?
Welcome to the potluck guys. Jake, you look pretty.
What's up with the limp?
Well, sit down and relax. Oh, by the way, I've entered everyone's name into a raffle and the winner gets whatever is in that.
Oh, how wonderful!
Oh...
Well, great, I'll just put this on ice.
It looks like we don't have to make that lemon run after all.
Yes, I did! I sent your invite in the mail!
It's time for the raffle. And the winner is.... Finn.
Congrats, Finn, you won a... Sea Lard.  Here you go.Finn! You scared me!
What are you doing here, Finn?
It's 5:30 in the morning.
Thank you, that's very nice.
Thank you.
Yes, but can you move just a bit...
No, no, like, out of the way.
Okay, what else do I need? Aw, dangit, I forgot we're out of milk. Now I have to go get it from
Finn, I thought you went home.
You're really going over the top here. Take it easy. Princess's orders.
No, no, resting on the job is not resting. Go somewhere where you can relax!
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two. Okay, robots, all the number ones, go stand on that platform over there. And all the number twos, just turn around and face the wall.  And no peeking!
Number twos! Chop, chop!
Rattleballs is still what?!
Captain Root Beer Guy,  assemble my guard!
Banana Guards, destroy!
Dang right I do! You killed all my banana guards!
Ahem! Okay, everyone,  I took care of Rattleballs.
Everything's settled. I don't have to go back on my order, and you can protect the kingdom from the shadows.
Wait!  I dub thee Sir Rattleballs!Oh, hi, Finn.
Yeah-yeah. That sounds great.
That's great!  Gre-gre-great! Great, great!
Hey, guys. I saw my seismograph had gone off the charts, so I figured you might be in trouble, right?
What? Marceline's gonna rap for me?
Did you get the Spoon of Prosperity?
Peeps will never starve in my eternal empire. Sand worm, up!Yo, Finn, are you seeing these penguins?
Well, he'll have to beat my Banana Guards and my Gumball Guardians.
What did he say?
Well, what's your plan?
You do?
Uh, alright, so you're not gonna tell me your
Yes. The calvary  is standing by.
Okay, but what?
Jake, what's with all the mystery?
Banana Guards, defend!
Aw, jeez.
You'll never get past these walls... I think.
But what'll happen when they run out of bottles?
Wait a minute!  Put away your weapons and we'll get you more bottles.
I have a third plan.
Yup.
Yes.
Heh, yeah.
What? What do you want? I don't
We're going to make more bottles. Just wait, okay?Huh? Hee hee hee!
What a patoot. Thanks for saving the day yet again, boys.
I'm gonna throw you two a party. Meet at the Candy KingdomTONIGHT!
Greetings, party-goers! Glad you could all make it!
Whoa! No, I haven't!  Wanna continue this conversation on the dance floor?
Wow! That would mean that the babylons would fluctuate with the piranha-nanosphere!
Oh, uh... Alright!  Finn, what the cabbage? I was learning about Zanoits!
Zanoits kill hundreds of thousands of Plantoids a year.
Plantoids produce mellotoxin!  Mellotoxin kills Zanoits!!
You're totally jealous of Ricardio.
That's jealousy, hun.
What's going on here?
Ricardio?!
Finn... why'd you do it?
These were for our balbaflonic laser.
Finn... you shouldn't punch brainiacs. You know how fragile they are! You gotta stop this jealous business.
C'mon, Ricardio. I'll patch you up and give you candy.
Finn!! Jake!!
Finn! I feel like a big idiot for doubting you! He was just so engaging! ...But his knowledge on plantoids is actually pretty weak.
Yeah, no, I won't!
Thanks again for saving me... again.
Now that Ricardio's gone, you don't have to be jealous of anyone anymore.
Kiss me, Finn.  Ahem.  I mean... kiss me, Finn.  Am I doing it right, Jake?Next stop, Lollipop Park Estates.
What are you doing? Let me go! No!
Where are those Banana Guards?
I'm using this marmalade spray-on tan...
So... being tan is my thing now...
Congratulations. Whee! Whee! You were so good at solving the case.
The fake kidnapping! To test the Candy Kingdom security system.
But if you weren't following the clues I left, who was?
Then why the jumping jay is he in handcuffs?!Okay, okay, I'm up.  Ah!
Hey, everybody. I've asked you here today because you are the best of the best.
Anyway, recent data shows an increased chance of threat to the Candy Kingdom.
So I'm developing a new defense.  I've installed sleeping gas in the Gumball Guardians. If any bum tries to attack us, they will be sprayed without mercy. Isn't that nice? The only thing is the gas will spread and knock out anyone who breathes itanyone but you guys, my trained elite. So watch closely. I'm gonna show you all how to overcome the gas  with sheer willpower.  Hit it!
Now make a fist with your brain and punch against sleepy times, saying, No! NOOO! NOOOOO! Don't go on gentle into that good night.
Marceline! You're up late.
Hmm, I don't know. I'm, uh, kinda busy.
Oh, what?!
Ohhh, I think I see where this is going.
But why are you so interested in finding Maja?
Whoa. Okay, but
Um, sure, but
Whee!
Hmmm.  It's a Sleeping Gate Bramble.
All we have to do is take the path of least resistance.
It's in here  and in here . Now  take a deep breath  and be passive.
Hello, friend. Trouble relaxing? How 'bout a cup of chamomile tea?
Tell me about it. My googoomamameter is going babies. And look at my watch!
It's running backwards. There's serious witchery afoot here.
What are those things?
Wibba-wha?
Your teddy bear?
Yo, wait a sec!
Marcy, how old are you? It's a trick, right? Come on!
NO!
Don't be dense! Hambo can't even talk! Snap out of it, girl.
That's seriously what this is about? Rescuing your old teddy bear?
Um, yeah. Raggedy Princess can make you a new Hambo in, like, three seconds... or Raggedy Princess can be your new Hambo. She'd do it, too. That girl's got, like, zero self-respect.  That's meandon't tell her I said that.
It's just a doll.
What's that? You gonna bop me one?
I'm sorry, Marceline. Let's go get Hambo.
We should track that bird-rabbit thing.
Hmm.  Bang.  There goes some broken branches. It left a trail.
Hey! Hold on now!  This bag's mad heavy!
Glommit!    MARCELINE!  I thought you needed my help.  Huh.  Nice trick, Maja.  You in there, Marceline? Hyup!
WHOAAAA!  Woof.   Okay, PB, use your brain. Where would this witch keep Hambo? Break it down.  Micro... and macro... the picture... becomes... clear... and... call it!  Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, wait...  yes.
Jeez, man. This must be all of her stolen junk. Ugh, what a creep.  Psh, a Ford Broncus.  Hmm...  Whoa!  My Privates? Come here, biddy.  Bam. Whoops!  What the?  Invoices?  Receipts?  Zumma zoom bleep blop for the purchase of Hambo. Whoa, WHAT?!
So you purchased Hambo? From some weenus named Ash?
Where's Marceline?
By the laws of my kingdom, I must honor the exchange of goods for legal tender. But guess whatI'm not leaving without Hambo.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
Marceline!  Yoink!
I took care of it.  Let's bust out.Alright. Let me just add three more drops of explosive diarrhea.
No. If my decorpsinator serum works, all the dead Candy People will look as young and healthy as you do.
Pick up that platter, tough guy.
We used to date.
Work.
Wait, something's wrong.
No, this is wrong. They're not coming back to life--they're still dead! The decorpsinator serum--it's incomplete!
Oh, this is really bad. They're going to be attracted to the Candy Kingdom!
Because the Candy People are made of sugar, ya ding dong!
Good one, Finn. Quickly, to the kingdom!
All citizens of the Candy Kingdom! Report to the palace, immediately!
Hurry, sweet citizens.
Citizens, we are assembled here in the candy foyer for a momentous announcement. Tonight we are all going to have... a slumber party!
Go ahead and start partying.
We'll be right back, everyone.
Finn, the Candy People can't know about the zombies.
If they knew, they would flip out.
I mean they would flip out.
Not telling the Candy People about the zombies is so important that you need to promise, Royal Promise, not to let anyone find out about the zombies, ever.
No, Finn. You have to Royal Promise.
Now I must cloister myself in the lab and finish the equation to my decorpsinator serum. You keep the candy folk distracted and ignorant. Can you do that?
Good. Don't tell anyone about the zombies. Never ever.
What? Huh? Oh, Finn! Did you break your Royal Promise?
This is really, really bad, Finn. You can't break Royal Promises. Never, ever, never. No matter what, forever.
The Guardians of the Royal Promise are coming for us.
Wait! He's my friend! Isn't there another option?!
Finn, you're terrible at math.
You've defeated the broken royal promise! The Gumball Guardians are resetting!
Four, four... Four, four, four... That's it! The answer was so simple, I was too smart to see it!
'4' is the last figure I need to perfect my decorpsinator serum.
I hope you grasp the full consequences of breaking promises.
Alright, alright.
Oh, you are adorable. But keep your promises, okay?Let me see.
Rest in peace, Root Beer Guy.
How long will your force field hold, Gridface Princess?
Colonel Candy Corn?
Ready the cannons. You got me? If they get through that barrier, I don't want to have to use our ground troops.
Yeah. Good luck.
Peppermint Butler, come on!
Finn and Jake, are you ready towhat the...? Finn?  Where the jam is Finn?!
What the jam?!
All right. Finn or no Finn, PB's got to get in that biz.  Hyah!
Oh, zang!
Party tonight in the Candy Kingdom!
Hey, where's Finn?
Okay. Y'all bring food and bevs. Finn, you make the guac, all right?And here at this site, my Great Uncle Gumbald cut down all these taffy trees in a single night.
Nah. Hey, but I bet they have a ton of stories about your human relatives.
Ohhh, boy... I've made things awkward. Well, let's forget about that. I brought you guys here because I need you to rip out all these stumps!
I'm glad to see you out of that funk... about being the only huma...  I mean...  Well! I'm gonna scram! No hard feelings right?
I've enjoyed your visit immensely, Susan Strong.
They're gonna what?!
Very well. I shall gather my citizens in the courtyard... and you shall see how terrifying the Candy People can be!  Ah-bloo-bloo-bloo!!
Good news, Finn! I've managed to make my people horrifying!
I've disguised them as gruesome creatures, like witches, and ghouls!I'm glad you sent for me, and please, call me Bonnibel! Hey, what's your first?
Yeah, my subjects tend to panic in crisis situations, too.  It's tough; a ruler's got to deal with a lot of subservient dummies.
Whoa! Whoa! Hold up. My Mondometer is going cuckoo.  Where does this lead?
Well, whatever is back there is kicking out mondo energy levels. It could have something to do with the cooling.
Do you wanna save your kingdom or not?
What? Oh, no no no! This little geothermic control module, or whatever it is, accidentally fell out.  I was just putting it back!
Yeah, ancient technology's always falling apart.  Oh! The readings are over here now!
Okay, let me explain. These bad boys are just too dangerous to remain functional, and I can't risk you or your bananas brother using them, especially now that you've lost most of your powers.  So let me just finish disarming...
Aah! Shield, shield!
Hey, nice shot! Ya ding dong!
Cloak.
The Fire Kingdom has always been a threat to my realm!
And I can't leave my people's safety to chance!
'Cause you're a ding dong. I've got to do whatever it takes to protect my peeps.
Shields off.  Okay, I'll come clean.
It was me. I messed with the core temperature to get in here. I had to get near your weapon stockpile.
Ummm...
I'm PB! I spy on everybody. No big D!
Eh.
Okay, keep one last fire giant. I'm not a bad person. I want you to see that. I promise.
Ice King, call it off.
Hmmm...Yoo-hoo!  Hey guys!
Why yes indeed. Although according to the invitation, we're supposed to use mystery names. And mine is Lady Quietbottom.
Nobody knows!
Excuse me, Guy Farting, there's an envelope on your back.
Did you put that enevlope on him?
What's it say, Prince Hotbod?
It looks real to me.
So who's the ghost, BMO?
Guys, if there really is a ghost killer, then we should stay in a group. He can't take us all on if we're in a group!
LSP, are you okay? Where are you?
She did it! She's possessed! Tie her up!
Finn, there's no way I would remember that...
What! Wait you guys!  Look!
It was a wax dummy, dummy! Jake switched me out while Lady was distracting you.Yeah, go on, get out of here!  Unless you feel like a fist cookie, you better keep runnin'!
Duke of Nuts!  What have you done?!
Yeah, I guess if green and bald is okay.
Five days?! The Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty is tonight!
I already know, Finn! The Duke of Nuts has always been a bad guy. But now that he's done this, I'll never forgive him! And it's not just because I hate the Duke! I'd never forgive anybody who did this to me! I'd hate them!
FOREVER!
Finally. I have a witness to his misdeeds!
Oh Finn, my flawless, flawless champion, bring the Duke of Nuts to justice. The justice of a cold dungeon!
Oh, thank you, Finn!
Finn! Did you find the duke yet?
Um, guys?
What was the point of this little play again?  And why isn't the duke clapped in irons?!
Peppermint Butler!
Finn?
Hmm...well, I could never stay mad at you forever. And you seem genuinely penitence.
But that doesn't douse my hatred for the duke!
That jerk always empties out my pudding pantry!
Oh, my, you poor man! Of course you're forgiven!  Yeah, I don't believe a word from him.
Maybe there is, Finn. Maybe there is... hey!Ahhhhhhhhhh!
Please! Calm yourselves, my people. I am safe! Oh, thank you, Finn. You truly are my hero this day.
Hero... Hmmm... Heeeeerroooo... Hey, I just thought of something!
I'll show you. Come on! We'll go through my secret entrance.  Alright, everyone. Turn around.
Well, turn around. This entrance is secret.
Math. Hurry, Finn!
Here it is. Check it out.
No, Finn. It's what you can see through the globe.
Look. See this book?
It's called the Enchiridion. It's a book meant only for heroes whose hearts are righteous.
The book lies at the top of Mount Cragdor, guarded by a manly minotaur. It's waiting for a truly righteous hero to claim it!
Yeah, I know. And yes, I do.
Farewell, FiOh, wait a minute...  Farewell, Finn the human boy!
Yeah. What does it say, Finn? Mannish Man won't tell me.
Mannish man!Hey, Finn! How's the mission going?
Some say he's a half-man, half-bird that poops fire while he flies. It's all rumors so far. That's why I need you and Jake to find out everything you can about him and report back to me.
Under the sea. The mermaids are trying to beach themselves. I came to see why. Turns out they're just lonely.
Sounds great, Finn.
Bye!AHHHHH!!!! WHO'S THERE?!
WHAT THE JUNK?!? NO!
What the? UGH!!! GET OFF!!!!  GET OFF OF ME!
That was an accident.
FINN!!! STOP!!!!
FINN! STOP!!! That's not Billy! IT'S THE LICH!!!
Oh NO!!! Finn! WHAT DID YOU DO?!
JAKE, STOP HIM! DON'T LET HIM THROUGH THAT PORTAL!
HANG ON, JAKE!!!In the Kingdom of Ooo there is a galaxy of flavors, but only one taste sensation is amazing enough to kill forthe Royal tart.   Royal tarts are very rare. They are only eaten at the most sacred gathering in Ooothe annual Back-Rubbing Ceremony . The tart is so legendary that countless thieves will risk their lives for just one bite.
My head will be decapitated if the tarts don't make it to the ceremony. I only trust one guy to deliver them... the Royal Tart Toter.
He used to be, but he's gone mad and old. So he can't deliver the tarts anymore. Cinnamon Bun offered to fill the position, but he's kind of... half-baked.
Are you sure Finn? This is really important.
Well... I accept your offer.
Welcome to the Tartorium!
No, boys. Those are the reject tarts, full of imperfections.  These are the perfect tarts...  safely packed into one of my anti-gravity tote chambers.
Now, I want you to tote those tarts through that tunnel.  The Royal Tart Path takes you directly to the Royal Congressional Hall in the Bad Lands. The path is really safe and well protected, but keep your eyes open for any sign of danger, okay?
Good. Now here's your map.
That's paralyzing potion, Finn! Don't touch it. It'll paralyze you forever!
Thank you, boys. And remember, my head is on the line!
Hey, Finn.
I'm just checking in using the holo-pendant. How are my tarts doing?
Finn? Finn! Oh, well, I'll see you soon enough!
Hello?
Another perfectly chopped tart!
Let the annual Back-Rubbing Ceremony begin!
Okay! Jeez, Finn, I won't eat that tart. I'll eat this other tart instead!
I'm not paralyzed! I'm gripped with the flavor!
Excuse me! What is this about poisoned tarts and alternate plans?
Oh, Finn, I forgive you'cause I lied to you, too! They weren't going to decapitate me; I just said that so you guys wouldn't eat the tarts!
So I guess we're even.
The old Tart Toter!  Nobody move! He can't see or hear, but he can feel your movement.Come on, Finn! We're doing music chairs.
Uh, uh...
You take it, Finn. You're my guest.
Hey, Finn.
Bup, bup, bup. Hey, you wanna ditch the party and go for a walk?
It's been a while since we just hung out, you know?
Ah, they should be fine, right? For once? Maybe they'll surprise me by being fine. Come on.
Secret passage.
It's so nice to get away sometimes.
Yeah. They mean well, though. You wanna meet Timmy?
Timmy!
Hop on!
So got any other weekend plans?
Oh, I'm gonna garden some, plan next week's pizza lunch, answer 800 e-mails, and... you know, whatever.
Sure. I mean, it's a lot of responsibility  looking after so many people, though lately I have been trying to be more chill about it.
Yeah, and, like, being more... sorta okay with everyone making mistakes around me. Like mind my own stuff more. You know what I mean?
Timmy!
Here, try this one.
You got a little edible fire mustache there.
Hey, what's that?
Let me see.
I'll worry about it later.
You wanna see the burrito room?
Me, too!
Whoa. It looks like the Candy People's makeshift government has been taken over by a ruthless despot.
Eh, it was worth giving them a shot. Let's go back to the party, though. It looks like we have to save it.
What's going on here?
Okay, everybody get into your sleeping bags, and I'll read you a story.
Modern menswear can be traced back two hundred years. Furs and textiles became easier to produce...Ice King, what are you doing in my bedroom?!
Do you think I like being kidnapped is that what you think I want!
Banana Guards!
Take him out.
Okay, leave.
Yes.
Fun cakes!
BANANA GUARDS!!Oh. Hi, guys! Just gettin' the grill cookin' for tonight's BBQ!
What's that you got behind your back there, Finny?
Really? Can I scope it?
A'ight.
Achoo!  Can I open my eyes?
I'm gonna open my eyes.  Oh, Finn! It's pink! I love pink! Oh, thanks, Finn!
Yes, Chet?
Hey... If you two aren't watching the grill, then who's watching the....  ...GRILL?!?!
Finn! That was awesome.
I see. Your heroic brain is fascinating in a scientific way. Many scientific minds are going to be speaking at my barbeque. You should talk about something, too. You'll do that for me, right?
Thanks, Finn!  Listen, I have to deal with this.  See you tonight?
Thanks again to Dr. Dextrose for sharing your fascinating research on the future of cuteness.
And now for a special guest lecture by one of Ooo's greatest heroes... Finn the Human!
Hmm?
Finn... that would mean you've created...
FINN!! DO SOMETHING!!
UNDER CONTROL?! MY GUESTS ARE TERRIFIED!!
YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL US ALL?!?
Finn...! You've gone insane!
Glasses? Finn... take those off. You're not yourself!
Please!! I need the real you!
You blew it, Finn! With this!
Be careful!  Finn!! Look out!!
Finn... My Science Barbecue was a fiasco...
What's this?  Make hyper bubble. Cause black hole. Become insane. PB takes off the glasses. Save the day. Win the heart of the princess.? Finn, you knew all this would happen?!Hey, what?  Who's that?
Okay, yeah?
Thank you, Braco. That's very sweet, but no.
That is way out of line, Peps, and you guys are donking up my research!  Hello! Donk, donk!
Hmmm, what you're feeling is called infatuation. The pain is the product of you overvaluing a projected, imaginary relationship with me.
Braco!
Okay Braco, but just for research, alright?
Now hand it to me...  hmmm.  Okay, I have what I need for now.
Hi, Braco. Nice... hat.
Mhmmmmm .
My crown?
Hmmm .
Hey, guys.
This is a soul stone.  I need one for something I'm working on. Of course, it's really rare, but my scanners found one. It's in the Vapor Swamps.  I printed the map with all the detail.
What?
Oh, that's Braco, a suitor of mine.
Hmmm.
Braco. Ehhh, what happened to you?
Oh, yeah, sorry, but I don't need that anymore. I just finished programming a proper simulation of a soul. In fact, this is much easier to manipulate than a real one.  Braco?
And what's your number-one priority?
Awesome, he he he.  You ready to go on some dates?
There's a guy named Braco who's really nice.
Braco? What happened to you?!
Yes, I love you.
Oh, Braco, I don't want any of that mess. I do love you, but it's the undifferentiated love I feel for all candy citizens. I couldn't permit one of my citizens to suffer the way I saw you suffering over me. And so I made you this. Meet my doppelganger, P-Bot.
You're welcome, my love .
I let him go, Peps. I knew he couldn't be happy without me so I built him a robo-wife.Jake, Jake! Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
Wait, you don't know?
Here, look. It was taped to the tower.
My biggest powerometer back at the castle was flipping all the way out.  It looks like Finn somehow manifested a telekinetic electromagnetic prosthesis.
With this much raw power he could be a danger to himself or others. So I've quarantined the area till I can coax him down.
What does that mean?
It's not healthy, it's bizarre and he could get hurt!
Eeeeah.
Didn't help much did it.
Bong Bong.  Sorry buddy.
We're in the Candy Kingdom fallout shelter.  I brought you here after you passed out on the tower. You were hallucinating like crazy so it was really easy to trick you. I figured you'd thank me later after learning your lesson.
And look, the arm is gone too. See?  So what do you think?
MY ARM!!!Bring them inside.
Hey, you're up!
I thought you might be hungry.
So, who knocked you out?
Ugh! I hate those boys!
Word 'em up.
Amen. Wait, what?!
They what?!
Parents should protect their children!
All the Candy People are like my children, except young Mr. Cream Puff... he's like my boyfriend. Anyway, protecting my people is the most important thing to me. That's why I've got to take down the Bath Boy Gang.
I got a plana secret, awesome plan. In the meantime, I've gotta cover this radioactive river with candy. Wanna help?
Thanks for pitching in, Shoko! You can stay here as long as you want.
A Bath Boy!
That was bananamas! Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Wow. Your parents are the worst... hey, come with me. I wanna show you something.
My secret project is in here.
The Gumball Guardians. Wanna help me finish them?
That's it! There's just one last step.
Hello.
Y'all go guard now, and don't let nobody mess with my stuff!
Hey, guess what, thanks for helping me make those guys.
I want to repay you for your help.
No. No, dude, I made you a thing.
No! In the box.
What do you mean Oh, no? I made you an arm! It's a dang plug 'n' play, girl.
That's right, I'm a technical wonder-child.
Okay! I thought we could do some two-arm stuff, but... uh, it's cool!
Ah, jeez, you're so loud!
No! Don't just guard me! You need to protect everyone!
Wha-hut? Whoa, hey!
Get her out of there, quick!
Alright. Take a break for the night.
Hallo, Bubblegum hier...  atonement? Alright, Finn, I'm on my way.
Whoa, what?! My amulet?! Wait a second...  Is that...?Of course, Finn. Once you explained about Jake's sandwich, I had to.
I'm picking up major levels here.
Molasses.
He's using a molasses-based super-covalent subatomic bond, slowing down anything that enters its field, but only if the molasses is at room temperature. Hmm, this one.  My molasses warmer will get things moving.
Well, I'm out of ideas.
Marceline.
See, I think the molasses must be protected by some sort of chemical
Yeah, Marceline's got a great plan.
Stay sad.
Yay!Hi, Finn!
Why? I'm watering right now.
What is this, Finn?
Whoa! Really? Where do we sit?
Um, Finn?
Oh.
Finn, I don't understand--
Well, okay.   You're lucky I love spaghetti!
Finn, of course I like you.
Yeah!
Oh, Finn, that's sweet. Sure, I'll give you some of my hair.  Here. Take it, you cutie.
My spaghetti!The other one.
Hey Finn! Let's go.
Thanks again for coming to Castle Lemongrab with me, Finn. I kinda hate these diplomatic dinners. Also, I think the Lemongrabs are getting weirder.
It's just a shame that Jake didn't wanna come. I love Jake.
Finn, this is mega-weird. Something's happened to the two Lemongrabs. They used to be exactly the same.
Ugh, I can't watch this any more. Excuse me, Finn.
Man, this place is fallin' apart. Huh?
What's your name, little boy?
Hey! By all accounts, this is a brilliant and sensitive little boy.
I'm taking Lemonhope back to the Candy Kingdom and enrolling him in a school for gifted children.
We need to free that darling boy. Maybe there's something in the Candy Kingdom-Lemon Earldom treaty. I don't think there is.
Finn, what are you talking about?
I don't see how that's going to help us at all.
Finn, no, that's reallyhmm... okay, yeah! We'll pull a prank. Like old times.
Pretty smart, dude.
Hey!
No, no. Your plan was great, Finn.  See? What's this? Huh?  Your flute. Wow, now Lemonhope can play it and the Lemongrabs will come open the door to smash the flute and we can all escape! Really great work, Finn.
Here, Lemonhope. Now will you play something for us? Something beautiful?
Let me help you withLemonhope!
Oh, no! We're locked in. Finn, give me your phone, I'm calling Jake!
Finn, this is serious!
Finn, your other plan failed, which was part of my plan, which worked.
Finn, I have citizens who need me. I can't always treat everything like a little boy game.
What?
Finn...
You're going to love the Candy Kingdom, Lemonhope. You're learn all about playing, and play-math, and learning all day long, and you'll never get yelled at. Unless you drink my soda from out of the fridge.Finn? Finn? Finn! Where are you? I need you to try this!
Nah. This is an instant bath serum. It makes you sweat cleaning agents.
YOU'RE so spice!
Wait, wait! You can't give orders like that! I'm in charge here, Lemongrab!
No... He is rightful ruler under kingdom law. It's complicated.  I created Lemongrab.
He was the first of my experiments gone wrong...
... And now that I'm younger than him, he inherits the right to the throne.
Finn, this is dirt balls! We gotta do something to make him leave!
Hey, yeah! And I have the perfect prank! C'mon, Finn!
I don't think that worked out too math, Finn.
Okay!
Oh, yeah? What?
Yeah! I made it super-hot this time!
Shoot!
No, Finn... There's only one way. I just didn't want to have to do it. If I change myself back to my real age, I can reclaim the throne.
Because being 13 again is... Bloobaloobie!
While being 18 is all plock dumps and wagglezags... I never really get to act like a kid. But, it's okay. Really. My people need me, and that comes first!
First thing we need is more candy flesh to increase my biomass. But I need my lab equipment to engineer it.
Oh, thank you! Thank you, all! Okay... Next we need a bonding agent.
There's one last thing we need.  Only the heat from a whopping love hug can catalyze the re-age-ifying process.
Yes, Finn. But... first, I just want to say how much fun I've had hanging out with you.
And I... I wish I could stay... like this, with you, but--
'Scuse, me, Finn.  Yo, Earl!
Hey! You're fired, ya BUTT!
I'm so glad everything's back to normal. Thanks for all your help, Finn.
What is it, Finn?
What? Finn, you silly! That was, like, five years ago! You really gotta move on.
Such a silly boy.Cheers, Lumpy Space Princess.
Oh, don't worry, Finn. The Mallow Tea Ceremony takes years to master.
Hey, now!  Royal intervention! Surely there must be an antidote to the lumps.
What happens if he doesn't take the antidote by sunset?
I should not have drunk that much tea!Oh, I brought my own.
Sounds great.
What's that?
I don't know. It seems pretty important, Finn.
Are we meeting next week to watch a movie?
Finn.
How does this work?
Okay.
Check, please...?He-e-e-elp m-e-e-e-e-e-e!
Sure!
Thanks, Jake.
Oh, they think I've been replaced with an evil lizard replicant. It's sheer nonsense.
What the fridge?
Finn, Jake! Reptilian synthoid replicants are trying to take over the kingdom!
No, no! I'm the real one!
It's okay, BMO. It's a very mild offense.Go capture the Ice King, and bring him to me.
Ich bin hier, Finn. I'm in here, Finn.
It's me, the princess. Did you bring him?
Ah-bababap! No time! Now quickly, with me!
Ttubllaw!
This stairway leads to the dungeon where we'll toss that lousy Ice King!
Chhh, he didn't do anything. Not a thing.
It's a long story, Finn. You see, the Ice King...
No! I need more time!
Alright, alright, I have to go. You two just guard the Ice King until I return  and be prepared to make him howl with pain.
Sorry for the delay.
And now, Ice King, prepare to howl with  pain?
Where is the Ice King?
What have you done?!
I'll show you.
A plague of Freezer Burn Flu.
Well, yes and no.
It happened 3 days ago.
We don't think he was trying to spread disease, but soon the entire kingdom was infect by his beard flakes.
Through my research, I quickly discovered that the only way to cure my people was to obtain the pained howls of the Ice King himself.
But when I pleaded with him directly...
Please, I beseech your aid. In the name of common decency!
No!
No!
He had his chance to help and he did nothing!
I had no choice but to try and take his wails by force.
I know, I know. You're right.
Oh, thank you, Finn. I...
They're all getting better! Finn and Jake did it! Ich bin so glucklich, ich koennte, ich koennte... I'm so happy, I could, I could...Get back here, you thieving Door Lord! You butt!
Finn?
It's the door of the Door Lord, Finn. We used to lock them up, but they kept breaking out. 'Cause they're Door Lords.
Hmph.
That was sweet what you said about being buds.
For our next attempt, I wanna be the lead.
BMO, execute Sound Structure Alpha.  Marceline, begin playing triplet quavers in mixolydian mode.
Now, Finn, vibrate your uvula by dampening and undampening your larynx.
Okay, okay. Jake, are you gonna join in?
Everyone, just stick to my blueprints.
I may have, um... miscalculated.
I never said you had to be perfect!
...But by doing so, he showed us...
Oh, you.
It's mine! That's mine.
Yeah. It, uh, means a lot to me.
Dude, I wear it all the time... as pajamas.What's going on here?
Oh, Finn, ...you did all that for me?  That's for being sweet.  And that's for cheating. Finn, you know better than to ruin the sanctity of Wizard Battle. Wizards only, silly. Okay, everyone! Go home! Start getting ready for next year!Starchie, you have a cold. The cure is right here. Just let me-
Oh, come on.
Nurse Pound Cake, hold Starchie while I administer the serum.
What?
Listen, all magic is scientific principles presented like mystical hoo-doo, which is fun but it's sort of irresponsible. I got your magic right here, okay? And razzle dazzle! Flooby-doo! Zamabamafoo!
No, I'm making fun of spells.
Starchie, I just want to help.
All right! You want me to go to Wizard City and get you a cold spell?
You still think I'm a jerk?  All right, sit tight.
He's still sick.
He won't take it. He wants me to get him a cold spell from Wizard City.
dude, you guys! Really?
Have you two been to Wizard City?
Well, then what?
All right, meet me outside of Wizard City in your freshest wizard johns.
Guys, hold up! I got the password from the Ice King. Apparently, the barrier only responds to the voice of real wizards.
Say the password, Ice King!
Say the password.
Password! Now!!'
Pshh! It's a vocal registry rigged to a vibration modulator. The wall's still there. It's just the density's all wobbled.
Um...That's what it is, Jake.
It looks like a mutation.
Yeah, right. Just 'cause I know my shnoz.  Look at these dopes. Half of these spells are all working on entanglement principles.
That's not what I meant, but whatevs. Where's this magic shop?
They're like the city po-po or something.
Bingo.
Come on.
Ha ha ha! Oh, what a silly non-magic user, right?
How's it work?
What? I'm curious. So, what's in it?
So you want to sell me a product with no information?
Made from what?
What's the magic made out of, ding-dong?
Yoink!  Dang.
Dang! It's a dead end!
Please!
No! As ruler of the Candy Kingdom, I demand parley with the Grand Master Wizard!
No!
All magic is science! You just don't know what you're doing, so you call it magic! And, well.., it's.. ridiculous.
Yeah, I'm okay.
Good night.  Stupid wizards...
BRING IT ON.
I've had it with you silly wizards!
No!!
What?
Whoa!
Okay. Let's get out of here.
Hmm. I've got an idea.
Rubeldubel dingeldongel- Pffrt!Okay. I'm going to lower the screen. Tell me what you see.
Nope. Only you can see it because you're hooked up to the aura visualizer. But actually I'm lying. We can see everything you see on this screen. Now I'm gonna send that image into Crunchy.
Except...  Crunchy's true essence manifested in the material plane!
Sure, Finn! Just let me re-calibrate the device!
How long has this been going on?
And you didn't tell me?!
I'm gonna talk to him.
Sorry, guys!
Lemongrab!
Why are you stalking my peeps?!
Yeah, but what are you doing?! It's creepin' me out!
...Yeah?
Wait! What do you mean nothing?
But you don't get along with others! I don't understand you, Lemongrab!
Something totally bum-slops.
Please, please! All I need is three healthy volunteers to move in with Lemongrab! He's all by himself with no one to govern!
Come on, Mr. Cupcake! Just for a little while?
Alright! What's it gonna take, people?!
You got nerve showing your faces here, notorious Pup Gang!
...And what is that?
Mmmm... Granted.
Jake, please! What is your second demand?
I grant you the big cash money wad! Now off with you, to Castle Lemongrab!
Crunchy, wake up, Crunchy.
Maybe... Let's keep looking.  Awww, geez!  Hey!
What happened to your new citizens?
Hmmm... I wonder if you don't understand their candy stylez! C'mon, lemme show you something!
You see, Earl, candy people are mad special.  They need constant stroking, and snuggling...
Ah!  Here. You try.
Oh, dear! His Candy Citizens!
Yes. He's my responsibility. I have to try to help him!
Wait. I have a plan. You guys go on ahead.
Lemongrab, stop! Please! Earl, I can help you!
Wait, Lemongrab, look!
I made him for you, in your pantry. For you to be with!
Take care, boys!
