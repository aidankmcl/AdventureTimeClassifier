Thanks!
Thanks...
You saved the day mega-rad cool guy! What's your name?
The Enchiridion! I want to be your best and closest friend.
Awww... what a good guy!
Don't be sad, Ice King! We're going on a space adventure!
Here we gooo!!!!
Hyah! Hyah!
Thanks! I've got to do something today.
Uh... sometimes Gumball's missions can be so... lame.
Uh... I'd love to, but... maybe later...
What was that?
Something's on the roof! Come on!
Mhnn...
Marshall Lee!
Be careful!
You got it!
A... a gumwad?
Uh...
Umm...
Hey!
Bad little boy.
That's what you're acting like, I really don't buy... that you're that kind of guy... and if you are, why do you want to hang out with me?
You're not so bad, you know.
I'm not trying to be bad... I'm hanging out with you because you're my friend.
No... different!
Hey! Yah!
Hey!
Cake! You okay?
Come on, let's get outta here.
Look, I don't care if you're being a jerk to me... but nobody messes with Cake.
What?
MARSHALL!
Cake!
Cake!
Marshall?
Marshall!
Come on! You gotta be okay!
I-I get that you flirt with me all the time, and it's funny or whatever, but you're doing that now?!  What are you trying to do to my head? You think I've got some little crush on you? Well, for however long we've got left... FOR ONCE, DROP IT, YOU FREAK!Throw it, Cake!
Eyahh!
These Jelly Kinders aren't... alive, are they?
Sounds like it gonna be large.
You want me to go with you to the ball?
Oh. Right.
I'll check it out.
It's Ice Queen!
Back inside!
Ice Queen, why are you always predatoring on dudes?
What?
Cake! Morning-star mode!
Oh, uh, yeah I guess. Is she gone?
I was just going to go home, I...
Go... out?
What?
No, it's not. I'm sure when he said go out, he meant go out, not go out!
Come on, you heard what he said. I'm like his guy-friend.
If it's a date, why are you coming?
Man.
Fine, I'll do this if only to prove you wrong.
Mm... Let's just bail, I changed my mind.
That's cool, right?
Hey you didn't have to, guy...
Oh, uh, they're...
Huh! A crystal sword! I'm all about swords! How did you know?!
Thanks dude. It's just...WOW.
What?! No!
Will you keep your voice down?!
Hey, what's up?
Okay, but I'm gonna kick your butt.  Not that I'm thinking of butts...
Gumball!
Oh, my gosh, dude. That was, like, the stupidest thing ever.
Jeez, I dunno, I thought about it, but I think you could wear your pants as a shirt, if you really needed to.
Oh, um, is this a date?
As your chum?
It was a date! There was singing and junk!
Cake, he wants me to come to the ball as his girlfriend!
How am I supposed to fit my weapons in this?
I'll take my retractable sword.
Well, here I am.
Okay.
What? Hey, is this your bedroom?
Heh... whoa.  What?!
This is really messed up, Ice Queen! WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM WITH ME?!
I can't believe I fell for this trash! You got me to show up with a dress! And a pur  My purse! My sword!
Get it off me!
Shhh... It's okay, it's okay. It was the Ice Queen.
And this is for yanking my heart guts!
No, you might catch her crazy.
No way, man. Not interested.  I think the reason I got all these guy-friends and no boyfriend is because I don't really want to date any of 'em. I don't need feel like I'm waiting to be noticed. I know who I am. And I'll know what I want when and if it ever comes along. But there is one guy I would do anything to date.  The Ice King!
Ice King is the hottest hottie, and I can't waitI missed you, Ice King!
Of course they can! Dreams are real!Yah! Aiyah! Aha!
Cake, I'll save the captives, you take care of those animals!
You're free to go people!
Hmm?
I don't care about your clothes!
-care about you're clothes.
Pretty!
Uh... What just happened?
I don't care, as long as we can hang out! Anyone want a sandwich?
Who eats gold?
Come on, you beautiful dandy! Only your pure spirit can defeat your evil family!
And this sword!
I don't care.
LSP!
