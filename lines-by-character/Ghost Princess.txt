Yeeeeessss...
Sorry... It's just... I'm doomed to haunt this mortal plane...
Until I discover the cause of my death, my soul can't ascend to the 50th Dead World. But as a ghost, I have no memory of my mortal life... and no idea how I died...
OH! That sounds wonderful!
This way, gentlemen!
It's the cradle of my despair...
Well... here's me.
He's right...!
What...?
I'm Ghost Princess. Have we met before? I feel like we have.
So, you really don't know how you died either?
I feel... sweetles also in this moment also.
Are you talking about Spirit Waves...?
It's alright, Finn... I'm calling off the investigation.
I don't feel tormented anymore now that I'm with Clarence.
It's hard to explain, but it's like we already know each other.
Thanks for your help...!
Have we met before?
It's hard to explain, but it's like we already know each other.
I forgive you, Clarence! Take my hands! Ascend with me to the 50th Dead Wooorld...!
Claaareeence!!!
Goodbyyye...! Thanks for everything!I'm really nervous right now... I-I just really want to meet a nice king.
I screwed it up, didn't I!
