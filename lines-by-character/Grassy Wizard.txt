Comin' up here tryin' to enter my house! Are you for real?!  Mow 'em down, my cursed grassy objects!
Uh... go forth! Go... uh, forth.  That was all my grassy objects.
Never! You have no power over me, young fool! The grass sword will be part of you for all eternity!
What?
That's not how people are supposed to react to an eternal curse!
