Boo.
Mmm... couple hours.
It's... good... but, maybe it's time to let someone else try.  Listen up, y'all! I've got a story of my own!
The end.A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four.
What?
Mm-mm-mmm. I don't know. I get better finger action this way.
Yes?
A long, long time ago, Simon was my only friend. He was there when I needed help.
All he ever wanted was to find Betty, and now I can help him.
Simon?
Simon!
I thought I'd never see you again.
He's just kidding. I'm only a thousand.
Man, Simon.
You're dying!
Goodbye, Hambo.
Hmm...You guys wanna come party in the Nightosphere with me? I'm visiting with my dad and it's craaaazy boring.
Oh no, he's totally chill now.
Don't be a wiener dog. Jake, you coming?
Dad, stop!
Business? Dad, what do you even do?
Eh, I just don't see my self doing this biz'.
Dad!
Dad, I'm a thousand years old.
Look, let's play something, okay?
I know you just wanna give your little girl the world, but Daddy I'm not just your little girl. I've got my own life, I've got my own plans, I hope you understand and like the way that I am because I want your respect and I want to be here. But I don't wanna rule the Nightosphere.  Psssh. Whatever, Dad. [Puts the amulet on. A suit comes out of it and wraps itself around her. The phone is dropped and tentacles are seen. The phone is picked up and Marceline is seen looking like her father's monster's form in It Came from the Nightosphere. The camera zooms out to show Finn approaching Marceline while she laughs evilly.
Who's next? Who's next?
What do you desire, cowering spec? Pain? Pleasure? Or... weird punishment?
No, weird punishment!   And what do you desire? P, P, or WP?
Okay.
Come on, come on, next!
You sure, dude? Don't you want abs?
Who are you?
Eh.
Dad, you tricked me.  Dad, that sucks!
Yeah, I want you to be proud. I want you to be proud of me!
Dad...
Okay, okay, I gotta go now, Dad.  Woof. What a nightmare. Man, Finn, my dad actually likes you. I don't wanna hang out with you anymore.  Finn?Hey, guys. What's up? I'm Marceline the Vampire Queen.
Calm down, weenies. I'm not gonna do that.
Sometimes, I do. But it's not the blood that I like. It's the color. I eat shades of red.
Ugh, I am exhausted. I've been traveling all over the Land of Ooo. And I've seen some stuff that would really make you say like what?
I encountered a school of goldfish beasts.
And I fooled around in the Fire Kingdom.
Oh, and check these out.
Oh, these aren't ordinary nuts.
You guys seem cool, too, but as you can imagine, I'm really tired, so you two should probably get going.
Look.  M for Marceline.
I carved in this tree years ago. Way before you two rascals started squatting here.
But seriously guys, thanks for keeping the place warm for me, I mean really great!
Good night!
Hey, Finn.
Wow, pretty awesome party ya got here.
Oh, I just wanna show you somethin'. This cave belongs to me!
Thanks for fixing the place up for me.
Yes, I caaaannnnnn!
Ya know, you're right. I guess I'll take him too!
I'll bite him a little, maybe turn him into a zombie.
Make me.
No one... makes me... let go... of Jake!
You're pathetic, little boy.
Make me.  Bleh-bleh!
Your blood is mine!
Ow! That actually hurt, Finn.
'Cuz that was fun! I haven't fought like that in years! Thanks, Finn.
You two are pretty hardcore. I can appreciate that.
Yeah! Keep it, as a gift from me. Blaeargh!Hold it right there!
I'm a thousand years old and this is my crown!
Noooo! No! Noo! This crown is magic. Bad, terrible magic. Too dangerous for mortal fingies like yours!  One thousand years ago, my beloved friend Simon Petrikov gave his life to save this foolish, unworthy planet from annihilation.  A frightful bomb was poised to bathe the land in mutagenic horror,  but using his mastery of ice and snow, Simon froze the bomb in mid-flight only inches from the ground, where it remains to this very day.  Today, ever ripe and ready to blow.  But he alone was not saved. Trapped under the giant weight of the enormous bomb, poor Simon perished!
And the horrible crown, grieving its lost master, loosed a spasm of magic so wild and crazy the entire earth was buried in ice for four hundred boring years.
No! Magic is real!
Step off! Or I will use this!
I'm sorry. You must DIEEEE!
Oh, man! This thing! Dang it!
Aaah! Go back to the underworld, ya beast.
Destroy the world more like it!  Dummy. I give up.
I know you're not really talking to me. I'm not crazy!
I can't. My knees!
Okay, alright.
It's mine! I'm a demon... half-demon.
Oh, my bones!
You must promise topromise to return the crown to its hide-hole.
Finn! Return thewhoa!
Yes. Powerful and dangerous.
Whatever. You just gotta believe me, okay? For serious, ya donk.
You do?  Wait! Noooooo! Dang it!Yeeeaaah, I dont know.  Uhhhhh, jeez! Im never gonna find this place! Hmmm.  Hey!  Hey! Hey rock giant!  You seem cool! Do you know where wizard Bills music shop is? I cant find it anywhere! Hes got a guitar that plays the most savory licks in Ooo!
Huuuuh. Ive got an idea.  Okaaay, point now.  Wahahahoh yeah! Woowhohaha!  Thanks man!Speak.
Yeah, I'll help. It'll be funny.
Hello, Bonnibel.
Hey, look, Finn, I know Jake's your friend and all, but... if you really want Bubblegum to go to the movies with you, you've gotta like, stop taking advice from your dog and take some advice from a real girl!
How is Jake going to know what girls want more than a real girl?
Okay great. So what we need now is something... fun! Girls love fun more than anything. Fun, fun, fun! If you can show Princess Bubblegum you're fun, she'll deffs wanna go to the movies with you.
So... what do you like to do for fun, Finn?
No, no, that's perfect! All you need to do is get in there and wrestle Princess Bubblegum to show her how fun you are.
Finn! What the plum are you wearing? You look horrible!
Well, it's going to ruin the plan.
That suit was ridiculous.
Gee, he seems pretty ticked.
Oh, okay. Well taste this, then. I've gotta a new plan.
The only thing women like more than fun is excitement! She needs to feel her blood pump, man! She needs to... be chased by wolves!
Come on, I'll teach ya how to show a girl a good time. Wraps Finn's arms around her.] Hold tight. You ready?
Shhh! She's probably asleep!
Now don't blow it this time!
Shhh. Come on, Finn, a brainlord like Bonnie? You'll be bored with her in a week! And anyway I, for one, think you're pretty great.  Sorry it didn't work out the way you wanted. See you later, I guess!
Uh-oh.
We need to talk...
Finn, you do not want to go down that road with me.
Oh, yeah? No one would want to go to the movies with...  this!  What do you think of me now?
Uuugh!  You're starting to annoy me!
Get off me!  Finn, I like you, but I
No!  Listen to me. I'm not going to go to the movies with you! I just don't like you... that way.
I'm sorry Finn, I just... I don't wanna date you.
Wait, you don't want me to be your girlfriend?
If you weren't looking for a girlfriend then why were you romancing it up all day?
Of course I'll go with you, Finn!
Yeah, as friends!
But no tongue.
There's nothing I'd like more.Woot! Woot!
Hey, so I want you all to meet Finn and Jake. They aren't... completely lame.
Guys, this is Wendy...
Booboo...
...and Georgy.
We used to be in a gang together back in the underworld.
Oh yeah. Sorry, I don't ever really sit on there. I just float usually. We... kinda all do.
Yeah, well, too bad you're not vampires. So, anyways, I...
All right, all right. Fine.
Don't worry, I've got something more fun in mind.
Okay, hold that thought.
I'm gonna perform the biting ritual. You guys close your eyes and don't open them until I say so. If you do... your heads will EXPLODE! Okay, Finn. You first.
Bite.
Chomp.
Boop boop. Boop. Boop. Okey dokey. All done. How do you guys feel?
Relax, guys. You can satisfy your bloodlust without killing. Look.  You just eat the color. Here, Jake. You try.
Mmm... Not yet. That's a really advanced power. First, you gotta go through vampire orientation.
Think you chumps can handle it?
Okay, guys, the first phase of vampire orientation is learning...  ...invisibility.
Ah! Hey!
You ready for the power of...invisibility?
Good. Now, spin!
Give it a whirl, Jake!  Now chant, INVISIBLE!INVISIBLE!
Yup. It worked?
Because you guys become vampires at the same time. So you are forever linked.
Nice vampire scare, guys.
Okay, everyone! Stop the toughness lesson!
Finn, Jake. You guys okay?
W-wait! There's more beginner lessons you need to learn before floating. Like... uh... the spooky vampire walk. See? Spoooooky... wooo!
You guys stop right now.
What are you guys waiting for? You said you had a plan.
Hey, you guys need to stop trying to kill my friends!
They're lying to you guys. They just wanna suck the guts out of the top of your head.
Guys, promise me you're going to that party.
You're not?
Oh. Okay.
VAMPIRE KICK!!!  Finn. Jake. I'm so sorry I got you into this. I should've never pranked you so perfectly.
Oh, no, vampires can't beat ghosts. It's sort of a Rock-Paper-Scissors thing. I just came to apologize.Hmm...
What is it about henchman for life that you don't understand?
Henchman for life means, henchman for life!!
Fall on the ground for me!
Now cry for me!
Oh! If it isn't my favorite little goodie-two-shoes Finn!
I can make him do whatever I want. Watch. Henchman, amuse me.
Now hop around in a circle.
Oh, and how're ya gonna pull that off, hero?
Do you mean it?
Deal! Old henchman, you're free.
Hey, Jake.... BLEH!!
Oh, my code of honor wouldn't allow it.
Yes, Jake?  What would you like to talk about?!
You're lucky, Finn. Your first job as henchman is to help me feed.
Sounds like dinner. Finn, open the door.  OPEN IT ALREADY!
Aren't you bound by your word to do as I say, hero?
Hold him down!  Are you enjoying this, Finn?
Ugh! Enough talking! Dinner is served!
How dare you, henchman?! I order you to let me feed!
Mmm. That red bow tie was delicious!
What's wrong, Finn?
What? You know I eat the color red sometimes.
We've got plenty more evil to do!
Hey, Finn. You thinkin' about how that guy's bow tie sorta looked like a bra?
I know this place seems a little dead, but don't worry. It'll soon be undead.  Corpses buries in mud that's black, from death I command you to come back!  Hahaha! Are you ready to lead an evil army of the undead?!
Huh? What's that noise?
Excited to hear the wild screams of an entire castle?
Hahaha!
Hahaha!  I wrote this next song about a fisherman.
Don't do what?
Hey, castle-crasher!
You like cute things, right?
Then you might love this. The cutest dimple plant ever!
Here, eat some of its fruit. See what happens.
Okay, henchman, now... I need you to do something.
I want you to take this dimple plant outside, and kill it!
Use my ax bass.
There is no twist. Kill it now!
You should've hacked it to pieces when it was still adorable...
Oh, boy...  Not bad... for a henchman.
Yeah, it hurts, but I kinda like it. Reminds me of when I'd scrape my knees up as a kid, and my mom would patch me up... you know what I'm sayin'?
Hey, Finn, I need you to strangle some pixies.
Whoa, why are you being so casual about that? Strangling pixies is some hardcore evil.
What are you talking about? I...  Dang, man, I didn't think you'd ever catch on!
Oh, just an old diving buddy.   So, you ready to go strangle some pixies?
Ow!
Is it cool?
Finn, I owe you big-time! Changing into a bat and hiding in your pack was genius!
Oh, uh, that reminds me. You're fired from your henchman-ship. It's no fun when I can't trick you.
Definitely.No...  What are you doing here? I told you not to come around me!
I'm not gonna help you pick up on chicks!
Hey!!
Get outta here!!
No, he can stay.
It's alright. We're working on a song together.
No, it's okay. You guys can go.
So what kinda song're we playing?
Oookaaaay...
Stop acting like this!!
STOP ACTING CRAZY.
Huh?
Ugh!   You're so annoying, you pitiful old man. I'd like to help you, but I don't know if I can. I thought you were nuts, but you're really really really nuts.  Every time I move, eventually, you find me, and start hanging around. Just another lame excuse to see me. Man. It's getting me down. You know, I'm actually glad... to see you!  Maybe I'm the one who's...  nuts.
...Of course I do, you old jerk!
AAAAAGH!!! Not like that!! You don't remember anything, do you... SIMON?
Why do you even come see me when you don't remember me?! You don't even know who you are!
Huh? Look! This clipping! This was you, Simon! Before the War!
This! You took this picture! Grr, you've scribbled all over it... Huh?
What?  Wait, listen!
Marceline, is it just you and me in the wreckage of the world? That must be so confusing for a little girl. And I know you're going to need me here with you... but I'm losing myself, and I'm afraid you're going to lose me, too...
Oh! Um...  This magic keeps me alive, but it's making me  crazy, and I need to save you, but who's going to save me? Please forgive me for whatever I do  ...when I don't remember you.
What?! You don't remember what it means?!  Look!Thanks for helping me record, Finn.
Now, I'm gonna sing something really personal, so don't laugh at me.
Now, start a slow beat, and keep it steady, or it'll mess up everything.
Huh? Finn, you messed the beat up!
He's not worth the effort.
Well... first, I'd have to draw a circle with a happy face in the center and then... uh... douse it with bug milk.
And then you're supposed to chant something like , Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum.  But... I-I don't really wanna see him. I'm still mad about the thing with the fries.  Huh?!
Finn... what the heck did you do?!
Dad!  Ugh! You always do stuff like this!
Wha? HEY!!!
Give it back, and get out!!!
My bass!
Fine... but I'm only coming with you to get my bass back.
Finn! You can't kill my dad!
No! You literally can't kill my dad! He's deathless!
It's because they're scared of him.  Hm. My dad's been here. Come on. Let's go.
Look. You wanna help him? Help me get my bass back.
MY DAD STOLE MY BASS GUITAR, FINN!! And when I get it back... I'm gonna break it over his neck and slam my dad back into the Nightosphere!
Uh, sure, yeah, yeah, we'll do that.
Red Rock Pass. If my dad wants to get through the mountains, he'll have to come through here.
Daddy...
No... D-dad... I-I don't wanna destroy you...  Look, just... stay out of my life!!
I just want my dad to care about me.
Finn, you're like an ant to him.
What?
I'll stop following you if you give me back my guitar!
IN YOUR FACE, DAD!
Well... you don't respect anything! Dad!! DAD!! I'm outta here!
I said I'm outta here!
Dad, I...
Dad...
It's okay, Dad. It's... it's really okay.
I love you, too, Dad.
Finn!! How could you do that?!
How could you embarrass me like that and then stab my dad?!
I'm glad he's back in the Nightosphere. That was emotionally exhausting.
I've been meaning to ask you... What's with that pocket on your shirt?I warned you, dingle.
Careful there. Careful! Oh, dangit!  Oh, Simon   one more hit and that baby's gonna burst!
Ah, dingle!
I warned you... you butt...Smells like sourdough in here.
Huh.
Hello?
Is someone here?
That's what stinks.  Where are those dweebs?
Uh... Yeah, hey, you guys. Are you still coming over? It's jam time, so, like, call me, 'kay?
Welp... they're not gonna show up, then I'll just work on my own stuff, I guess.  Take one for new concept album based on five hundred years of my journal entries. So here's some preliminary notes.  I... I wanna make this the most emotional album ever. So private and secret, that I'll never let anyone hear.
No one can ever hear it. Ever. Take one.
Oh, what?! What happened?! Ugh!  Where are you?! Oh, there you are... My broom.
Stupid... thing Get...  NO! Stupid  UGH!!   Ugh!
I can hear both of you.
What're you bozos doing in my lair?
HEY!  Exssssplain yourselves.
Okay... apology accepted.
I hide in your house all the time.
Anyways, no hard feelings, guys! See you soon!I'm so glad we're doing this, Ash.
Wow. Awesome. Where'd you get the money for that thing?
You what? Are you crazy? That was my favorite thing in the whole world!
That's the last straw, Ash! That's it! You're a psycho jerk, and you ruined my life.
IT'S OVER, YOU PSYCHO!!
Quit touching my hair!
That's Ash.
He's not my friend; he's my boyfriend.
Ash, what's going on?
That's sweet.
Oh, grow up you guys. I'm going to go freshen up.
Oh, Ash.
It's over, you psycho!!
Finn? Finn, what are you doing? You can't be here! Ash doesn't like me hanging out with mere mortals.
Hello? Finn?
Finn, what's going on? What is this place?
It's over, you psycho!!
Finn, I think I'd like to wake up now.
Yeah. Thanks, Finn, I...Hmm.
Hey, you want to ditch this jazz?
Figs.
LSP, wait up!  Whoa.
Yo, LSP.  Sick tag.
You know, I like your vibe, dude. You don't take anyone's sass.
Listen, let's get even. Teach Old Greasy Locks a lesson.
This place smells like butter, bacon, sausage, and juice.
Yobo, Peebocheeks. Just kicking down the town with LSP-boos. She is acting sooo bad.
Too late. LSP is really doing it up right now. And I'm just feeding the flames.
How do you want to get past the Maple Man?
Nice distraction.
Ugh. I can't digest syrup.
Stop! Okay, just one more time.
Let's don't stop inside.
And her taste in music is terrible.  Check it out. I hate this album, but I'm taking it anyway.
We're busted. Turn invisible!
Well,  hide then.
That's awesome.
Hey! Calm your lumps.  It's okay! She's just dazed. I'll handle it.  Come on.  It'll be okay, dude. Girls like us just got to stick together.
Yeah.
Yeah, that was pretty rad.
Uh...probably not. I don't think there are bad people. I think good people do bad stuff sometimes, and, oh, that's bad. But only if you do it once, it's just a mistake, and...that's not bad. I think.
But...I mean,  I do think it was wrong to steal this CD.
We should probably mail it back to her.Yo, wake up, sand dude.  I think they're dead.  A spoon.
What's PB want with that spoon, anyway?
Yeah, I guess that's true with Bonnibel.
Is that quicksand?
Sure looks that way.
You just demolished half the underground city!
Undead!
Any more bright ideas?
How are snacks gonna get us out of here?
I'm hungry, too. Bust the snacks, Finn.
Hey, where are my red erasers? They were in here.
You... ate all... MY RED?!?!
Thanks, Finn.
Jake, I don't want to hurt you, but you should know things get crazy when I'm hungry.
I'm gonna go into feral mode.  It's not gonna be pretty.
I know. Let's tie me up. That way, you won't be scared.
Not physically, no, but as a prop, I think it'll be good for both of us. You know, psychologically.
Get me a bucket of lava, Jake.
Do iiiit...
I'm frickin' hungry.
Jaaaake...
I can smell your insides, Jake.  They smell...  red!
Yeah, lemme see in there.
Oh, yeah.
Jake...
I won't be able to... to control myself much longer. I can feel the feeding frenzy coming on.  I just wanna let you know I'm sorry.
Yeah...
What?
What are you doing?
You're gonna eat me?
Yes, I am.
Go where, Jake?  I gotta suck out your insides first, right?
Time to eat!  Huh? What the?
Woof. Thanks, Bonnie. That's enough low-grade red to get me home, at least. Come on, guys. Let's go.I'm gonna close this portal.  You're forbidden to come back to the Nightosphere!
It's too late! Stay away from me, FOREVVVEEERRRR!!!!Uh! Nope! Ha-ha, too slow!
Well, he's very dear to my heart. I love him.
We've been around for a long time, we have a long history together. It's... it's a long story.
Alright, I suppose it's about time I told someone this story.
Well, little Marcy felt a lot better. And she and Simon lived happily ever after.
Okay.Yo, Bubblegum!
No time for chitchat. Let's hang outright now.
Listen, Bub-Bubs. I tracked down Maja the Sky Witch.
Yeah, I tailed her to an enchanted forest, but it's all jammed up with barrier spells.
Well, you love getting out your big brain and... and... I just thought it'd be cool to spend some quality time with you.  I need your help, okay?
It's just really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really important to me.
Come on, I got your pack-pack.
Hold on to that but, PB.
Gah! Something's wrong. Huh? Hey!  This stuffit's like a brick wall!  Let's just blow the whole thing up.
How do we kill it?
Alright, so where is itthe path?
Grrrr!
Wow! Wild digs.
It's... pink.
Come on, Princess. We don't got all night.
Totem cairns.
That's Maja's Crabbit Familiar.
Hambo!
I'm sorry, man!
WHAT?!
Get off!  Buddy!
BONNIE!
You killed him?
He's been with a witch this whole time. Maybe he can talk now.
Yeah. Sorry I didn't tell you. You might not have come otherwise.
I'm not getting a new Hambo. There's only one Hambo.
See this?   Voooooooo...
It's comin' in for a landing. What'cha gonna do, PB? Wanna keep dissing Hambo?
Disengage.
Right.
I see it.
Where are you, Maja, you creep?  Oof.  What?  Hambo!  No!
You again. I'LL KILL YOU! Give me Ham Uh!
Hambo!  Oh, it's me, buddy!   How did you?Oh, hey, Jake. How you holding up?
Don't be sad.
Demon juice!Thanks, Finn.
Oh, with the submarine?Yeah.
They broke out because you let them live.
I know how to get through this door. We're gonna lay down a chill jam.
Just keep it cool. Got that princess?
...To bury you in the ground... and drink the blood from your... Ugh!
Stop staring at me! Ugh, you threw me off!
Yikes.
I'm just gonna get stuff to cook that.
I'm back yo! Come here, baby.
Alright, fine.  Wait, what's a quaver?
Ha! Looks like you aren't as perfect as you thought. Guess you can't judge me anymore.
Whatever,  Ugh! I'm outta here, too!
I totally get it. He may have stolen our treasures...
Hey, that's not...
You... kept the shirt I gave you?
But you never wore it.
No, I didn't!
I'll kill you!
